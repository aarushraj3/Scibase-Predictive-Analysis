However, when this information is acquired, moved, copied, or edited, the data may lose its quality. Often, the use of data administrators or a tool that has limited capabilities to correct the mistyped information can cause many problems. Moreover, most of the correction techniques are particularly implemented for the words used in daily conversations. Since personal names have different characteristics compared to general text, a hybrid matching algorithm (PNRS) which employs phonetic encoding, string matching and statistical facts to provide a possible candidate for misspelled names is developed. At the end, the efficiency of the proposed algorithm is compared with other well known spelling correction techniques.", "authors": [{"name": "cihan varol", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310484833"}, {"name": "coskun bayrak", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81312484669"}], "title": "Hybrid Matching Algorithm for Personal Names", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "55\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "469\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "sam houston state university", "city": "houston", "Name": "cihan varol"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of arkansas at little rock", "city": null, "Name": "coskun bayrak"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Ballou, D.

To this end, users are being asked to query these databases to provide information to help answer questions posed by key management personnel. Users who have had extensive experience with an organization\u2019s data can often detect the presence of errors in their queries when query results do not correspond to their ex ante expectations. New users, however, are less familiar with the data they will be querying. Having no, or limited, ex ante expectations for query results, new users may be unaware that the result produced by their query is incorrect. Unwarranted confidence in the correctness of their queries predisposes these users to stop looking for query errors even when their queries still contain errors. This behavior, premature stopping of query revision, prompts investigating whether new users\u2019 query performance would improve if they were not only provided with, but used, readily available information to form ex ante expectations. Our results demonstrated a threshold effect in new users heeding information for forming ex ante expectations. That is, the mere availability of information for forming ex ante expectations made no difference in query performance. When admonishing users to heed ex ante information, however, there was an associated increase in the accuracy of their queries. These results suggest that users unfamiliar with a particular database might make fewer query errors if they not only received readily available information but were then prompted to use the information to form ex ante expectations for query results.", "authors": [{"name": "david a robb", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548005459"}, {"name": "paul l bowen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100004103"}, {"name": "a faye borthick", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548005460"}, {"name": "fiona h rohde", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548005461"}], "title": "Improving New Users\u2019 Query Performance: Deterring Premature Stopping of Query Revision with Information for Forming Ex Ante Expectations", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "14\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "287\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "australia", "university": "university of queensland", "affiliation_string": "the university of queensland", "city": "brisbane", "Name": "david a robb"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "florida state university", "city": null, "Name": "paul l bowen"}, {"country": "georgia", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "georgia state university", "city": null, "Name": "a faye borthick"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "university of queensland", "affiliation_string": "the university of queensland", "city": "brisbane", "Name": "fiona h rohde"}]}}, "date": {"month": "September", "year": "2012"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Ahlers, P., Sullivan, R.

VA developed and deployed a computer-based disability exam documentation system in order to improve exam report quality and timeliness. We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing joint disability examinations supported by computerized templates to the examinations documented via dictation, to determine if the system met the intended goals or had unintended consequences. Consenting veterans were randomized to undergo exams documented using computerized templates or via dictation. We compared exam report quality, documentation time costs, encounter length, total time to fulfill an exam request with a finalized exam report, and veteran satisfaction. Computer-based templates resulted in disability exam reports that had higher quality scores (p. 0.042) and were returned to the requesting office faster than exam reports created via dictation (p. 0.02).Documentation time and veteran satisfaction were similar for both the documentation techniques. Encounter length was significantly longer for the template group. Computer-based templates impacted the VA disability evaluation system by improving report quality scores and production time and lengthening encounter times. Oversight bodies have called for mandated use of computer-based templates nationwide. We believe mandates regarding use of health information technology should be guided by data regarding its positive and negative impacts.", "authors": [{"name": "steven brown", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100013003"}, {"name": "trent s rosenbloom", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502802442"}, {"name": "shawn p hardenbrook", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502805061"}, {"name": "terry clark", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502769705"}, {"name": "elliot fielstein", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502802505"}, {"name": "peter elkin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100572351"}, {"name": "ted speroff", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502808580"}], "title": "Documentation quality and time costs: A randomized controlled trial of structured entry versus dictation", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "44\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "427\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "us department of veterans affairs and vanderbilt university nashville tn", "city": "nashville", "Name": "steven brown"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "vanderbilt university nashville tn", "city": "nashville", "Name": "trent s rosenbloom"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "us department of veterans affairs", "city": null, "Name": "shawn p hardenbrook"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "elliot fielstein", "city": null, "Name": "terry clark"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "trent s rosenbloom", "city": null, "Name": "us department of veterans affairs and vanderbilt university nashville tn"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "us department of veterans affairs and vanderbilt university nashville tn", "city": "nashville", "Name": "ted speroff"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["AQB 2009.

This hinders the exchange of data among systems (and organizations). Hence there is a need to provide standards for data exchange. In digitized form, the individual patient's medical record can be stored, retrieved, and shared over a network through enhancement in information technology. Thus, electronic health records (EHRs) should be standardized, incorporating semantic interoperability. A subsequent step requires that healthcare professionals and patients get involved in using the EHRs, with the help of technological developments. This study aims to provide different approaches in understanding some current and challenging concepts in health informatics. Successful handling of these challenges will lead to improved quality in healthcare by reducing medical errors, decreasing costs, and enhancing patient care. The study is focused on the following goals: (1) understanding the role of EHRs; (2) understanding the need for standardization to improve quality; (3) establishing interoperability in maintaining EHRs; (4) examining a framework for standardization and interoperability (the openEHR architecture; (5) identifying the role of archetypes for knowledge-based systems; and (6) understanding the difficulties in querying HER data.", "authors": [{"name": "shelly sachdeva", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474653815"}, {"name": "subhash bhalla", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100367378"}], "title": "Semantic interoperability in standardized electronic health record databases", "citations": [{"Name": "Harry D.

To lower data collection costs and increase the amount of data, artificially generated deception data can be used, but the impact of using artificially generated deception data is not well understood. This article studies the impact of artificially generated deception on document screening policies. The deception and truth data were collected from financial aid applications, a document-centric area with limited resources for screening. Real deception was augmented with artificial data generated by noise and deception generation models. Using the real data and artificially generated data, we designed an innovative experiment with deception type and deception rate as factors, and harmonic mean and cost as outcome variables. We used two budget models (fixed and variable) typically employed by financial aid offices to measure the cost of noncompliance in financial aid applications. The analysis included an evaluation of a common policy for deception screening using both fixed and varying screening rates. The results of the experiment provided evidence of similar performance of screening policy with real and artificial deception, suggesting the possibility of using artificially generated deception to reduce the costs associated with obtaining training data.", "authors": [{"name": "yanjuan yang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502696183"}, {"name": "michael mannino", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100584226"}], "title": "An Experimental Comparison of a Document Deception Detection Policy using Real and Artificial Deception", "citations": [{"Name": "Yanjuan Yang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michael V.

For example, two organizations contemplating a merger may want to know how common their customer bases are so that they may better assess the benefits of the merger. Another example is a database of people who are forbidden from a certain activity by regulators, may need to be compared to a list of people engaged in that activity. The autonomous entities who wish to carry out the record matching computation are often reluctant to fully share their data; they fear losing control over its subsequent dissemination and usage, or they want to insure privacy because the data is proprietary or confidential, and/or they are cautious simply because privacy laws forbid its disclosure or regulate the form of that disclosure. In such cases, the problem of carrying out the linkage computation without full data exchange has been calledprivate record linkage. Previous private record linkage techniques have made use of a third party. We provide efficient techniques for private record linkage that improve on previous work in that (1) our techniques make no use of a third party, and (2) they achieve much better performance than previous schemes in terms of their execution time while maintaining acceptable quality of output compared to nonprivacy settings. Our protocol consists of two phases. The first phase primarily produces candidate record pairs for matching, by carrying out a very fast (but not accurate) matching between such pairs of records.

As patients are increasingly willing to take an active part in managing their conditions, chronic disease self-management programs and information systems that support them are recognized for their potential to improve the quality of healthcare delivery. These programs often rely on recording longitudinal patient data and analyzing it. Therefore, maintaining appropriate data quality is important for self-management programs to be efficient and safe. We designed and implemented a prototype of a health self-management service for chronically ill people. It is a distributed application that supports patients with diabetes at tracking their blood glucose levels. The main design goals were usability, extensibility, security, and interoperability. The system integrates with the Microsoft HealthVault and Google Health personal health record platforms. It utilizes industry-strength storage and security mechanisms, is scalable, and as a result, can be used to gather, securely store, and analyze patient data over long periods of time. In this article we examine how software information technology can support chronic disease self-management and its impact on the quality of patient data.

The accuracy of the segmentation subsystem determines the performance of the other subsystems in any computer aided diagnosis system based on image analysis. We propose a novel technique for segmentation of lung tissue from computed tomography of the chest. Manual segmentation of lung parenchyma becomes difficult with an enormous volume of images. The goal of this work is to present an automated approach to segmentation of lung parenchyma from the rest of the chest CT image. The approach involves the conventional optimal thresholding technique and operations based on convex edge and centroid properties of the lung region. The segmentation technique proposed in this article can be used to preprocess lung images given to a computer aided diagnosis system for diagnosis of lung disorders. This improves the diagnostic performance of the system.

We also developed a concatenation structure to allow the handling of company name changes, mergers, and spin-offs without artificially altering numerical series. At the same time, we maintained the transparency of the historical information on each individual company listed. Thanks to the overlapping of digital and hand-collected data, the completed database has a very high level of detail and accuracy.

Indexing techniques are generally used to efficiently extract a set of candidate records from the database that are similar to a query record, and that are to be compared with the query record in more detail. The sorted neighborhood indexing method, which sorts a database and compares records within a sliding window, has been successfully used for ER of large static databases. However, because it is based on static sorted arrays and is designed for batch ER that resolves all records in a database rather than resolving those relating to a single query record, this technique is not suitable for real-time ER on dynamic databases that are constantly updated. We propose a tree-based technique that facilitates dynamic indexing based on the sorted neighborhood method, which can be used for real-time ER, and investigate both static and adaptive window approaches. We propose an approach to reduce query matching times by precalculating the similarities between attribute values stored in neighboring tree nodes. We also propose a multitree solution where different sorting keys are used to reduce the effects of errors and variations in attribute values on matching quality by building several distinct index trees. We experimentally evaluate our proposed techniques on large real datasets, as well as on synthetic data with different data quality characteristics. Our results show that as the index grows, no appreciable increase occurs in both record insertion and query times, and that using multiple trees gives noticeable improvements on matching quality with only a small increase in query time. Compared to earlier indexing techniques for real-time ER, our approach achieves significantly reduced indexing and query matching times while maintaining high matching accuracy.", "authors": [{"name": "banda ramadan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658653781"}, {"name": "peter christen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100259455"}, {"name": "huizhi liang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81438593067"}, {"name": "ross w gayler", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331492896"}], "title": "Dynamic Sorted Neighborhood Indexing for Real-Time Entity Resolution", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "203\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "23\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "203\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "philippines", "university": "national university", "affiliation_string": "australian national university canberra australia", "city": "manila", "Name": "banda ramadan"}, {"country": "philippines", "university": "national university", "affiliation_string": "australian national university canberra australia", "city": "manila", "Name": "peter christen"}, {"country": "philippines", "university": "national university", "affiliation_string": "australian national university canberra australia", "city": "manila", "Name": "huizhi liang"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Dirk Ahlers and Mahsa Mehrpoor. 2014.

In certain common settings, traditional methods for evaluating predictive models tend to miss rare but important errors\u2014most importantly, cases for which the model is confident of its prediction (but wrong). In this article, we present a system that, in a game-like setting, asks humans to identify cases that will cause the predictive model-based system to fail. Such techniques are valuable in discovering problematic cases that may not reveal themselves during the normal operation of the system and may include cases that are rare but catastrophic. We describe the design of the system, including design iterations that did not quite work. In particular, the system incentivizes humans to provide examples that are difficult for the model to handle by providing a reward proportional to the magnitude of the predictive model's error. The humans are asked to \u201cBeat the Machine\u201d and find cases where the automatic model (\u201cthe Machine\u201d) is wrong. Experiments show that the humans using Beat the Machine identify more errors than do traditional techniques for discovering errors in predictive models, and, indeed, they identify many more errors where the machine is (wrongly) confident it is correct. Furthermore, those cases the humans identify seem to be not simply outliers, but coherent areas missed completely by the model. Beat the Machine identifies the \u201cunknown unknowns.\u201d Beat the Machine has been deployed at an industrial scale by several companies. The main impact has been that firms are changing their perspective on and practice of evaluating predictive models.\u201cThere are known knowns. These are things we know that we know.

A quick literature survey shows that a significant number of information quality frameworks are proposed in different domains of application: management information systems, web information systems, information fusion systems, and so forth. Unfortunately, they do not provide a feasible methodology that is both simple and intuitive to be implemented in practice. In order to address this need, we present in this article a new information quality methodology. Our methodology makes use of existing frameworks and proposes a three-step process capable of tracking the quality changes through the system. In the first step and as a novelty compared to existing studies, we propose decomposing the information system into its elementary modules. Having access to each module allows us to locally define the information quality. Then, in the second step, we model each processing module by a quality transfer function, capturing the module\u2019s influence over the information quality. In the third step, we make use of the previous two steps in order to estimate the quality of the entire information system. Thus, our methodology allows informing the end-user on both output quality and local quality. The proof of concept of our methodology has been carried out considering two applications: an automatic target recognition system and a diagnosis coding support system.", "authors": [{"name": "ion-george todoran", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658726742"}, {"name": "laurent lecornu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351592425"}, {"name": "ali khenchaf", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100007430"}, {"name": "jean-marc le caillec", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658727862"}], "title": "A Methodology to Evaluate Important Dimensions of Information Quality in Systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Roman Lukyanenko", "Country": "oman", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "339\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "22\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "339\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "france", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "telecom bretagne france", "city": null, "Name": "ion-george todoran"}, {"country": "france", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "telecom bretagne france", "city": null, "Name": "laurent lecornu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "jean-marc le caillec", "city": null, "Name": "ali khenchaf"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "laurent lecornu", "city": null, "Name": "telecom bretagne france"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Angelo Brayner , Andr\u00e9 L.

Matching aims to identify tuples that refer to the same real-world object, and repairing is to make a database consistent by fixing errors in the data by using integrity constraints. These are typically treated as separate processes in current data cleaning systems, based on heuristic solutions. This article studies a new problem in connection with data cleaning, namely the interaction between record matching and data repairing. We show that repairing can effectively help us identify matches, and vice versa. To capture the interaction, we provide a uniform framework that seamlessly unifies repairing and matching operations to clean a database based on integrity constraints, matching rules, and master data. We give a full treatment of fundamental problems associated with data cleaning via matching and repairing, including the static analyses of constraints and rules taken together, and the complexity, termination, and determinism analyses of data cleaning. We show that these problems are hard, ranging from NP-complete or coNP-complete, to PSPACE-complete. Nevertheless, we propose efficient algorithms to clean data via both matching and repairing. The algorithms finddeterministicfixesandreliablefixesbased on confidence and entropy analyses, respectively, which are more accurate than fixes generated by heuristics. Heuristic fixes are produced only when deterministic or reliable fixes are unavailable. We experimentally verify that our techniques can significantly improve the accuracy of record matching and data repairing that are taken as separate processes, using real-life and synthetic data.", "authors": [{"name": "wenfei fan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87059383157"}, {"name": "shuai ma", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87059258457"}, {"name": "nan tang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81300394101"}, {"name": "wenyuan yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81503664988"}], "title": "Interaction between Record Matching and Data Repairing", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "132\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "17\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "367\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of edinburgh", "affiliation_string": "university of edinburgh and sklsde lab beihang university", "city": "edinburgh", "Name": "wenfei fan"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "sklsde lab beihang university", "city": null, "Name": "shuai ma"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "wenyuan yu", "city": null, "Name": "nan tang"}]}, "Article No.: 15": {"references": ["Ethem Alpaydin, Introduction to Machine Learning (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning), The MIT Press, 2004\n", "Ranjita Bhagwan , Fred Douglis , Kirsten Hildrum , Jeffrey O.

Though such a retention policy might increase the value of accessible files, the method to arrive at such a policy is underresearched. This article discusses how one can arrive at a method for developing file retention policies based on the use values of files. The method\u2019s applicability is initially assessed through a case study at Capgemini, Netherlands. In the case study, we hypothesize that one can develop a file retention policy by testing causal relations between file attributes (as used by file retention methods) and the use value of files. Unfortunately, most file attributes used by file retention methods have a weak correlation with file value, resulting in the conclusion that these methods do not well select out high- and low-value files. This would imply the ineffectiveness of the used attributes in our study or errors in our conceptualization of file value. We continue with the last possibility and develop indicators for file utility (with low utility being waste). With this approach we were able to detect waste files, in a sample of files, with an accuracy of 80&percnt;. We therefore not only suggest further research in information waste detection as part of a file retention policy, but also to further explore other file attributes that could better predict file value and file utility.", "authors": [{"name": "fons wijnhoven", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100457594"}, {"name": "chintan amrit", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100575163"}, {"name": "pim dietz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=89558746857"}], "title": "Value-Based File Retention: File Attributes as File Value and Information Waste Indicators", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "55\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "185\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "netherlands", "university": "university of twente", "affiliation_string": "university of twente", "city": "enschede", "Name": "fons wijnhoven"}, {"country": "netherlands", "university": "university of twente", "affiliation_string": "university of twente", "city": "enschede", "Name": "chintan amrit"}, {"country": "netherlands", "university": "university of twente", "affiliation_string": "university of twente", "city": "enschede", "Name": "pim dietz"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2579167", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "louiqa raschid", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100329397"}], "title": "Editorial", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "24\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "119\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland", "city": null, "Name": "louiqa raschid"}]}, "Article No.: 17": {"references": ["David Aumueller , Hong-Hai Do , Sabine Massmann , Erhard Rahm, Schema and ontology matching with COMA++, Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data, June 14-16, 2005, Baltimore, Maryland[doi>10.1145/1066157.1066283]\n", "Franz Baader , Diego Calvanese , Deborah L.

However, it is conservatively estimated that there are almost nine times as many general practice encounters than there are hospital encounters each year in Ireland. This represents a very significant gap in health information. Indeed, general practice has been shown in other countries to be an important and rich source of information about the health of the population, their behaviors and their utilization of health services. Funded by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) undertook a feasibility study of diagnostic coding of routinely entered patient data and the creation of a national general practice morbidity and epidemiological database (GPMED project). This article outlines the process of data quality issue management undertaken.The study\u2019s findings suggest that the quality of data collection and reporting structures available in general practice throughout Ireland at the outset of this project were not adequate to permit the creation of a database of sufficient quality for service planning and policy or epidemiological research. Challenges include the dearth of a minimum standard of data recorded in consultations by GPs and the absence of the digital data recording and exporting infrastructure within Irish patient management software systems. In addition, there is at present a lack of recognition regarding the value of such data for patient management and service planning---including importantly, data collectors who do not fully accept the merit of maintaining data, which has a direct consequence for data quality. The work of this project has substantial implications for the data available to the health sector in Ireland and contributes to the knowledge base internationally regarding general practice morbidity data.", "authors": [{"name": "claire collins", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548938456"}, {"name": "kelly janssens", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548436456"}], "title": "Creating a General (Family) Practice Epidemiological Database in Ireland - Data Quality Issue Management", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "33\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "273\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "kelly janssens", "city": null, "Name": "claire collins"}]}, "Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Serge Abiteboul , Richard Hull , Victor Vianu, Foundations of Databases: The Logical Level, Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc., Boston, MA, 1995\n", "Franz Baader , Diego Calvanese , Deborah L.

The poor data quality of these databases, e.g. inaccuracy of drug contraindications, can lead to catastrophic consequences for the health condition of patients. Hence it is important to ensure their quality in terms of data completeness and soundness.In the database domain, standard Functional Dependencies (FDs) and INclusion Dependencies (INDs), have been proposed to prevent the insertion of incorrect data. But they are generally not expressive enough to represent a domain-specific set of constraints. To this end, conditional dependencies, i.e. standard dependencies extended with tableau patterns containing constant values, have been introduced and several methods have been proposed for their discovery and representation. The quality of drug databases can be considerably improved by their usage.Moreover, pharmacology information is inherently hierarchical and many standards propose graph structures to represent them, e.g. the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification (ATC) or OpenGalen\u2019s terminology. In this article, we emphasize that the technologies of the Semantic Web are adapted to represent these hierarchical structures, i.e. in RDFS and OWL. We also present a solution for representing conditional dependencies using a query language defined for these graph oriented structures, namely SPARQL. The benefits of this approach are interoperability with applications and ontologies of the Semantic Web as well as a reasoning-based query execution solution to clean underlying databases.", "authors": [{"name": "olivier cure", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351606083"}], "title": "Improving the Data Quality of Drug Databases using Conditional Dependencies and Ontologies", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "109\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "546\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universite paris-est", "city": null, "Name": "olivier cure"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["Chris R.

In order to cope with the greater numbers of older people, together with increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, governments are looking to new ways to provide care and support to older people and their care providers. A growing trend is where health and social care providers are moving towards the use of assisted living technologies to provide care and assistance in the home. In this article, the research area of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems is examined and the data, information and the higher-level contextual knowledge quality issues in relation to these systems, is discussed. Lack of quality control may result in an AAL system providing assistance and support based upon incorrect data, information and knowledge inputs, and this may have a detrimental effect on the person making use of the system. We propose a model whereby contextual knowledge gained during the AAL system\u2019s reasoning cycle can be fed back to aid in further quality checking at the various architectural layers, and a realistic AAL scenario is provided to support this. Future research should be conducted in these areas, with the requirement of building quality criteria into the design and implementation of AAL systems.", "authors": [{"name": "james mcnaull", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490690655"}, {"name": "juan carlos augusto", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100661153"}, {"name": "maurice mulvenna", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81500653577"}, {"name": "paul mccullagh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81500660763"}], "title": "Data and Information Quality Issues in Ambient Assisted Living Systems", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "110\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "624\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of ulster", "affiliation_string": "university of ulster newtownabbey", "city": "coleraine", "Name": "james mcnaull"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of ulster", "affiliation_string": "university of ulster newtownabbey", "city": "coleraine", "Name": "juan carlos augusto"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of ulster", "affiliation_string": "university of ulster newtownabbey", "city": "coleraine", "Name": "maurice mulvenna"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of ulster", "affiliation_string": "university of ulster newtownabbey", "city": "coleraine", "Name": "paul mccullagh"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Angrove, P., O\u2019Flynn, B., Barton, J., Gonzalez, A., O\u2019Mathuna, C., O\u2019Donoghue, J., Herbert, J., and Min, S.

Pervasive sensing devices that monitor properties of the environment (including human beings) can be a large data source. Unprocessed datasets may include data that is faulty and irrelevant, and data that is important and useful. If not managed correctly the large amount of data from a data-rich pervasive environment may result in information overload or delivery of incorrect information.Context-sensitive quality data management aims to gather, verify, process, and manage the multiple data sources in a pervasive environment in order to deliver high quality, relevant information to the end-user. Managing the quality of data from different sources, correlating related data, and making use of context, are all essential in providing end users with accurate and meaningful data in real time. This requirement is especially true for critical applications such as in a medical environment.This article presents the Data Management System (DMS) architecture. It is designed to deliver quality data service to its users. The DMS architecture employs an agent-based middleware to intelligently and effectively manage all pervasive data sources, and to make use of context to deliver relevant information to the end-user. Two of the DMS components are presented: (1) data validation and (2) data consistency. The DMS components have been rigorously evaluated using various medical-based test cases.This article demonstrates a careful, precise approach to data based on the quality of the data and the context of its use. It emphasises the DMS architecture and the role of software agents in providing quality data management.", "authors": [{"name": "john odonoghue", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81549247156"}, {"name": "john herbert", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100086264"}], "title": "Data Management within mHealth Environments: Patient Sensors, Mobile Devices, and Databases", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "126\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "14\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "825\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "john herbert", "city": null, "Name": "john odonoghue"}]}}, "date": {"month": "October", "year": "2012"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Donald Ballou , Richard Wang , Harold Pazer , Giri Kumar Tayi, Modeling Information Manufacturing Systems to Determine Information Product Quality, Management Science, v.44 n.4, p.462-484, April 1998[doi>10.1287/mnsc.44.4.462]\n", "Ballou, D.

ERP can improve data quality and information sharing within an organization. It can also pose challenges to data quality. While it is well known that data quality is important in ERP systems, most existing research has focused on identifying the factors affecting the implementation and the business values of ERP. With normal accident theory as a theoretical lens, we examine data quality problems in ERP using a case study of a large, fast-growing multinational manufacturer headquartered in China. Our findings show that organizations that have successfully implemented ERP can still experience certain data quality problems. We identify major data quality problems in data production, storage and maintenance, and utilization processes. We also analyze the causes of these data quality problems by linking them to certain characteristics of ERP systems within an organizational context. Our analysis shows that problems resulting from the tight coupling effects and the complexity of ERP-enabled manufacturing systems can be inevitable. This study will help researchers and practitioners formulate data management strategies that are effective in the presence of certain \u201cnormal\u201d data quality problems.", "authors": [{"name": "lan cao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100130362"}, {"name": "hongwei zhu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81758878957"}], "title": "Normal accidents: Data quality problems in ERP-enabled manufacturing", "citations": [{"Name": "Hongwei Zhu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Harris Wu", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "181\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "14\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "1026\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "old dominion university norfolk va", "city": null, "Name": "lan cao"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of massachusetts lowell ma", "city": null, "Name": "hongwei zhu"}]}, "Article No.: 12": {"references": ["Andrews, K.

Because of this there is a growing interest in competitive intelligence and intelligence information gathering systems (IIS). This article uses game-theoretic concepts to develop an analytic framework to assess the value of deploying a competitive intelligence gathering information system. Modeling the competitive environment as a game provides a useful approach to study and evaluate competitive strategies given diverse assumptions about the quality of the information known by the players. When determining the value of deploying an IIS, decision makers need to examine three components of the competitive environment: the competitive rules of the game, the state of player knowledge, and the reliability of the information gathered. This framework focuses on competitive environments where the players' state of knowledge (i.e., common versus covert knowledge) and the reliability of the information generated are essential to the decision making process. The article concludes with implications for research and practice.", "authors": [{"name": "dov biran", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81758796657"}, {"name": "michael h zack", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81408593002"}, {"name": "richard j briotta", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81758718057"}], "title": "Competitive intelligence and information quality: A game-theoretic perspective", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "83\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "683\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "michael h zack", "city": null, "Name": "dov biran"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "richard j briotta", "city": null, "Name": "northeastern university boston ma"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["Anderson, E.

Due to practical significance of the ER problem, many creative ER techniques have been proposed in the past, including those that analyze relationships that exist among entities in data. Such approaches view the database as an entity-relationship graph, where direct and indirect relationships correspond to paths in the graph. These techniques rely on measuring theconnection strengthamong various nodes in the graph by using a connection strength (CS) model. While such approaches have demonstrated significant advantage over traditional ER techniques, currently they also have a significant limitation: the CS models that they use are intuition-based fixed models that tend to behave well in general, but are very generic and not tuned to a specific domain, leading to suboptimal result quality. Hence, in this article we propose an approach that employs supervised learning to adapt the connection strength measure to the given domain using the available past/training data. The adaptive approach has several advantages: it increases both the quality and efficiency of ER and it also minimizes the domain analyst participation needed to tune the CS model to the given domain. The extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed approach reaches up to 8&percnt; higher accuracy than the graph-based ER methods that use fixed and intuition-based CS models.", "authors": [{"name": "rabia nuray-turan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81363603849"}, {"name": "dmitri v kalashnikov", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100458924"}, {"name": "sharad mehrotra", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331499070"}], "title": "Adaptive Connection Strength Models for Relationship-Based Entity Resolution", "citations": [{"Name": "Jie Xu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dmitri V.

Entity coreference algorithms can be used to detect duplicate database records and to determine if two Semantic Web instances represent the same underlying real word entity. The key issues in developing an entity coreference algorithm include how to locate context information and how to utilize the context appropriately. In this article, we present a novel entity coreference algorithm for ontology instances. For scalability reasons, we select a neighborhood of each instance from an RDF graph. To determine the similarity between two instances, our algorithm computes the similarity between comparable property values in the neighborhood graphs. The similarity of distinct URIs and blank nodes is computed by comparing their outgoing links. In an attempt to reduce the impact of distant nodes on the final similarity measure, we explore a distance-based discounting approach. To provide the best possible domain-independent matches, we propose an approach to compute the discriminability of triples in order to assign weights to the context information. We evaluated our algorithm using different instance categories from five datasets. Our experiments show that the best results are achieved by including both our discounting and triple discrimination approaches.", "authors": [{"name": "dezhao song", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81472648963"}, {"name": "jeff heflin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100579321"}], "title": "Domain-Independent Entity Coreference for Linking Ontology Instances", "citations": [{"Name": "Dezhao Song ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jeff Heflin", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dezhao Song", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "58\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "320\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "lehigh university", "city": null, "Name": "dezhao song"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "lehigh university", "city": null, "Name": "jeff heflin"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Peter Christen, Data Matching: Concepts and Techniques for Record Linkage, Entity Resolution, and Duplicate Detection, Springer Publishing Company, Incorporated, 2012\n", "Fellegi, I.

Data quality plays a critical role in a data-intensive, knowledge-based economy. The objective of this study is to identify the most important factors for accounting information quality and their impact on AIS data quality outcomes. The article includes an extensive literature review and summarizes studies in quality management, data quality, accounting information systems, and enterprise planning in helping to identify a set of critical success factors for data quality. The study uses empirical data to answer the research question and test the research hypothesis. Study results show that the top three most important factors that affect accounting information systems\u2019 data quality are top management commitment, the nature of the accounting information systems (such as the suitability of the systems), and input controls. The article further uses regression analysis to test the effect of those factors on AIS data quality, finding that there is a significant positive relationship between the perceived performance of the three most important factors and perceived AIS data quality outcomes.", "authors": [{"name": "hongjiang xu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87259157757"}], "title": "What Are the Most Important Factors for Accounting Information Quality and Their Impact on AIS Data Quality Outcomes?", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "327\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "47\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "356\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "butler university indianapolis in usa", "city": "indianapolis", "Name": "hongjiang xu"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["James Abello , Panos M.

Poor data quality is frequently cleansed using business rules derived from domain knowledge. Unfortunately, the process of designing and implementing cleansing activities based on business rules requires a relevant effort. In this article, we illustrate a model-based approach useful to perform inconsistency identification and corrective interventions, thus simplifying the process of developing cleansing activities. The article shows how the cleansing activities required to perform a sensitivity analysis can be easily developed using the proposed model-based approach. The sensitivity analysis provides insights on how the cleansing activities can affect the results of indicators computation. The approach has been successfully used on a database describing the working histories of an Italian area population. A model formalizing how data should evolve over time (i.e., a data consistency model) in such domain was created (by means of formal methods) and used to perform the cleansing and sensitivity analysis activities.", "authors": [{"name": "mario mezzanzanica", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490691714"}, {"name": "roberto boselli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100375669"}, {"name": "mirko cesarini", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100504090"}, {"name": "fabio mercorio", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81461658074"}], "title": "A Model-Based Approach for Developing Data Cleansing Solutions", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "242\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "24\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "279\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "italy", "university": "university of milan", "affiliation_string": "department of statistics and quantitative methods crisp research centre university of milano-bicocca italy", "city": "milan", "Name": "mario mezzanzanica"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of milan", "affiliation_string": "department of statistics and quantitative methods crisp research centre university of milano-bicocca italy", "city": "milan", "Name": "roberto boselli"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of milan", "affiliation_string": "department of statistics and quantitative methods crisp research centre university of milano-bicocca italy", "city": "milan", "Name": "mirko cesarini"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of milan", "affiliation_string": "department of statistics and quantitative methods crisp research centre university of milano-bicocca italy", "city": "milan", "Name": "fabio mercorio"}]}}, "date": {"month": "February", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Rakesh Agrawal , Jerry Kiernan, Watermarking relational databases, Proceedings of the 28th international conference on Very Large Data Bases, p.155-166, August 20-23, 2002, Hong Kong, China\n", "H.

To address this, we introduce a technique to directly associate provenance information with sensor datasets. Our technique is similar to traditional watermarking but is intended for application to unstructured time-series datasets. Our approach is potentially imperceptible given sufficient margins of error in datasets and is robust to a number of benign but likely transformations including truncation, rounding, bit-flipping, sampling, and reordering. We provide algorithms for both one-bit and blind mark checking and show how our system can be adapted to various data representation types. Our algorithms are probabilistic in nature and are characterized by both combinatorial and empirical analyses. Mark embedding can be applied at any point in the data life cycle, allowing adaptation of our scheme to social or scientific concerns.", "authors": [{"name": "stephen chong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658692124"}, {"name": "christian skalka", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100662052"}, {"name": "jeffrey a vaughan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314495325"}], "title": "Self-Identifying Data for Fair Use", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "92\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "20\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "100\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "harvard university cambridge ma", "city": "cambridge", "Name": "stephen chong"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "jeffrey a vaughan", "city": null, "Name": "christian skalka"}]}, "Article No.: 8": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2692312", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "paolo missier", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100381213"}, {"name": "paolo papotti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350576267"}], "title": "Editorial", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "46\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "13\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "60\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "paolo papotti", "city": null, "Name": "paolo missier"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["F.

This model has been designed to align with emerging standards for provenance on the Web to enable agents to reason about data provenance when performing quality assessment. The model also enables quality assessment provenance to be represented, thus allowing agents to make decisions about reuse of existing assessments. We also discuss the development of an OWL ontology as part of a software framework to support reasoning about data quality and assessment reuse.

In order to improve and sustain data quality in the long term, process-driven data quality management (PDDQM) seeks to redesign processes that create or modify data. Consequently, process modeling is mandatory for PDDQM. Current research examines process modeling languages with respect to representational capabilities. However, there is a gap, since process modeling languages for PDDQM are not considered. We address this research gap by providing a synthesis of the varying applications of process modeling languages for PDDQM. We conducted a keyword-based literature review in conferences as well as 74 highranked information systems and computer science journals, reviewing 1,555 articles from 1995 onwards. For practitioners, it is possible to integrate the quality perspective within broadly applied process models. For further research, we derive representational requirements for PDDQM that should be integrated within existing process modeling languages. However, there is a need for further representational analysis to examine the adequacy of upcoming process modeling languages. New or enhanced process modeling languages may substitute for PDDQM-specific process modeling languages and facilitate development of a broadly applicable and accepted process modeling language for PDDQM.", "authors": [{"name": "paul glowalla", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87258955657"}, {"name": "ali sunyaev", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81361599300"}], "title": "Process-driven data quality management: A critical review on the application of process modeling languages", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "166\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "12\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "429\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of cologne", "city": null, "Name": "paul glowalla"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of cologne", "city": null, "Name": "ali sunyaev"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["AnHai Doan , Alon Halevy , Zachary Ives, Principles of Data Integration, Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc., San Francisco, CA, 2012\n", "Forrester, J.

To detect and remove such duplicates, many commercial and academic products and methods have been developed. The evaluation of such systems is usually in need of pre-classified results. Such gold standards are often expensive to come by (much manual classification is necessary), not representative (too small or too synthetic), and proprietary and thus preclude repetition (company-internal data). This lament has been uttered in many papers and even more paper reviews.The proposedannealing standardis a structured set of duplicate detection results, some of which are manually verified and some of which are merely validated by many classifiers. As more and more classifiers are evaluated against the annealing standard, more and more results are verified and validation becomes more and more confident. We formally define gold, silver, and the annealing standard and their maintenance. Experiments show how quickly an annealing standard converges to a gold standard. Finally, we provide an annealing standard for 750,000 CDs to the duplicate detection community.", "authors": [{"name": "tobias vogel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81388600162"}, {"name": "arvid heise", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81464676236"}, {"name": "uwe draisbach", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81503679557"}, {"name": "dustin lange", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81472650565"}, {"name": "felix naumann", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100447576"}], "title": "Reach for gold: An annealing standard to evaluate duplicate detection results", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "56\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "173\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "arvid heise", "city": null, "Name": "tobias vogel"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "dustin lange", "city": null, "Name": "uwe draisbach"}]}, "Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Rakesh Agrawal , Samuel Ieong, Aggregating web offers to determine product prices, Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining, August 12-16, 2012, Beijing, China[doi>10.1145/2339530.2339602]\n", "Justin A.

This problem is important in data integration, data cleaning, and query answering. It is, however, challenging since in practice, reliable time stamps are often absent, among other things. We propose a model for conflict resolution by specifying data currency in terms of partial currency orders and currency constraints and by enforcing data consistency with constant conditional functional dependencies. We show that identifying data currency orders helps us repair inconsistent data, and vice versa. We investigate a number of fundamental problems associated with conflict resolution and establish their complexity. In addition, we introduce a framework and develop algorithms for conflict resolution by integrating data currency and consistency inferences into a single process and by interacting with users. We experimentally verify the accuracy and efficiency of our methods using real-life and synthetic data.", "authors": [{"name": "wenfei fan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452596317"}, {"name": "floris geerts", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100234746"}, {"name": "nan tang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81300394101"}, {"name": "wenyuan yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81477641497"}], "title": "Conflict resolution with data currency and consistency", "citations": [{"Name": "Zuhair Khayyat ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ihab F.

However, user reputation is just one way to determine trust. The estimation of trust can be tackled from other perspectives as well, including by looking at provenance.Here, we present a complete pipeline for estimating the trustworthiness of artifacts given their provenance and a set of sample evaluations. The pipeline is composed of a series of algorithms for (1) extracting relevant provenance features, (2) generating stereotypes of user behavior from provenance features, (3) estimating the reputation of both stereotypes and users, (4) using a combination of user and stereotype reputations to estimate the trustworthiness of artifacts, and (5) selecting sets of artifacts to trust. These algorithms rely on the W3C PROV recommendations for provenance and on evidential reasoning by means of subjective logic.We evaluate the pipeline over two tagging datasets: tags and evaluations from the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision\u2019sWaisda?video tagging platform, as well as crowdsourced annotations from theSteve.Museumproject. The approach achieves up to 85&percnt; precision when predicting tag trustworthiness. Perhaps more importantly, the pipeline provides satisfactory results using relatively little evidence through the use of provenance.", "authors": [{"name": "davide ceolin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658723721"}, {"name": "paul groth", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100235330"}, {"name": "valentina maccatrozzo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81552245756"}, {"name": "wan fokkink", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100571423"}, {"name": "willem robert van hage", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413604798"}, {"name": "archana nottamkandath", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87958688657"}], "title": "Combining User Reputation and Provenance Analysis for Trust Assessment", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "125\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "48\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "125\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Netherlands", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "vu university amsterdam amsterdam the netherlands", "city": "amsterdam", "Name": "davide ceolin"}, {"country": "Netherlands", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "elsevier bv amsterdam the netherlands", "city": "amsterdam", "Name": "paul groth"}, {"country": "Netherlands", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "vu university amsterdam amsterdam the netherlands", "city": "amsterdam", "Name": "valentina maccatrozzo"}, {"country": "Netherlands", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "vu university amsterdam amsterdam the netherlands", "city": "amsterdam", "Name": "wan fokkink"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "archana nottamkandath", "city": null, "Name": "willem robert van hage"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "paul groth", "city": null, "Name": "vu university amsterdam amsterdam the netherlands"}]}, "Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Tarek K.

A mathematical-statistical analysis indicates that, as we keep adding criteria to a multi-criteria conjunctive or disjunctive decision rule, errors in the data produce decision errors asymmetrically. As a result, in conjunctive decisions, the probability of a false negative increases while the probability of a false positive decreases. In contrast, in disjunctive decisions, as we keep adding criteria, the probability of a false positive increases while that of a false negative decreases. For instance, in a conjunctive business decision rule, the probability of overlooking a bargain can be far greater than the probability of misjudging an unattractive offer to be a good one. A series of Monte Carlo simulations validates the analytical findings and explores the contribution of several additional factors.", "authors": [{"name": "irit askira gelman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100302005"}], "title": "Biases in multi-criteria, satisficing decisions due to data errors", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "18\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "252\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": []}, "Article No.: 15": {"references": ["Abiteboul, S., Cluet, S., Milo, T., Mogilevsky, P., Simon, J., and Zohar, S. 1999.

An alternative approach to improve data quality is to exploit different data sources that contain information about the same set of objects. Such overlapping sources highlight hot-spots of poor data quality through conflicting data values and immediately provide alternative values for conflict resolution. In order to derive a dataset of high quality, we can merge the overlapping sources based on a quality assessment of the conflicting values. The quality of the resulting dataset, however, is highly dependent on our ability to asses the quality of conflicting values effectively.The main objective of this article is to introduce methods that aid the developer of an integrated system over overlapping, but contradicting sources in the task of improving the quality of data. Value conflicts between contradicting sources are often systematic, caused by some characteristic of the different sources. Our goal is to identify such systematic differences and outline data patterns that occur in conjunction with them. Evaluated by an expert user, the regularities discovered provide insights into possible conflict reasons and help to assess the quality of inconsistent values. The contributions of this article are two concepts of systematic conflicts: contradiction patterns and minimal update sequences. Contradiction patterns resemble a special form of association rules that summarize characteristic data properties for conflict occurrence. We adapt existing association rule mining algorithms for mining contradiction patterns. Contradiction patterns, however, view each class of conflicts in isolation, sometimes leading to largely overlapping patterns. Sequences of set-oriented update operations that transform one data source into the other are compact descriptions for all regular differences among the sources. We consider minimal update sequences as the most likely explanation for observed differences between overlapping data sources. Furthermore, the order of operations within the sequences point out potential dependencies between systematic differences. Finding minimal update sequences, however, is beyond reach in practice. We show that the problem already is NP-complete for a restricted set of operations. In the light of this intractability result, we present heuristics that lead to convincing results for all examples we considered.", "authors": [{"name": "heiko muller", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81381604158"}, {"name": "johann-christoph freytag", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100333077"}, {"name": "ulf leser", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100520165"}], "title": "Improving data quality by source analysis", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "121\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "13\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "1252\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "australia", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "csiro australia", "city": null, "Name": "heiko muller"}, {"country": "El Salvador", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "humboldt-universitat zu berlin berlin germany", "city": "berlin", "Name": "johann-christoph freytag"}, {"country": "El Salvador", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "humboldt-universitat zu berlin berlin germany", "city": "berlin", "Name": "ulf leser"}]}}, "date": {"month": "February", "year": "2012"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["David P.

Deception undermines many critical dimensions of information quality, such as accuracy, completeness, and believability. Despite this threat, information gatherers are ill equipped to assess the credibility of information suppliers. This work presents a prototype system that examines messages gathered during direct, face-to-face information gathering. The system unobtrusively identifies kinesic and linguistic features that may indicate deception in information suppliers\u2019 messages. System use was found to significantly improve assessment ability in between-subjects and within-subjects tests. The improved ability to accurately assess credibility during face-to-face interactions should yield higher information quality.", "authors": [{"name": "matthew l jensen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100640101"}, {"name": "judee k burgoon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100139378"}, {"name": "jay f nunamaker", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452618152"}], "title": "Judging the Credibility of Information Gathered from Face-to-Face Interactions", "citations": [{"Name": "Matthew Jensen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Paul Lowry ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jude Burgoon ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jay Nunamaker", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jr.", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "34\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "782\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "price college of business university of oklahoma", "city": null, "Name": "matthew l jensen"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "center for the management of information university of arizona", "city": null, "Name": "judee k burgoon"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "center for the management of information university of arizona", "city": null, "Name": "jay f nunamaker jr"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Rakesh Agrawal , Ramakrishnan Srikant, Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases, Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, p.487-499, September 12-15, 1994\n", "Barbara, D., Dumouchel, W., Faloutsos, C., Hass, P.

In this context, missing data is an important and known problem, since it can seriously affect the accuracy of conclusions drawn. Researchers have described several approaches for dealing with missing data, primarily attempting to infer values or estimate the impact of missing data on conclusions. However, few have considered approaches to characterize patterns of bias in missing data, that is, to determine the specific attributes that predict the missingness of data values. Knowledge of the specific systematic bias patterns in the incidence of missing data can help analysts more accurately assess the quality of conclusions drawn from data sets with missing data. This research proposes a methodology to combine a number of Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining techniques, including association rule mining, to discover patterns in related attribute values that help characterize these bias patterns. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach by applying it on a demo census dataset seeded with biased missing data. The experimental results show that our approach was able to find seeded biases and filter out most seeded noise.", "authors": [{"name": "monica chiarini tremblay", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81336493401"}, {"name": "kaushik dutta", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100634452"}, {"name": "debra vandermeer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100545041"}], "title": "Using Data Mining Techniques to Discover Bias Patterns in Missing Data", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "118\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "15\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "1625\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "philippines", "university": "national university", "affiliation_string": "florida international university", "city": "manila", "Name": "monica chiarini tremblay"}, {"country": "philippines", "university": "national university", "affiliation_string": "florida international university", "city": "manila", "Name": "kaushik dutta"}, {"country": "philippines", "university": "national university", "affiliation_string": "florida international university", "city": "manila", "Name": "debra vandermeer"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/1805286.1805287", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "stuart e madnick", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100304507"}, {"name": "yang w lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81466646277"}], "title": "Editors\u2019 Comments: ACM Journal of Data and Information Quality (JDIQ) is alive and well!", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "19\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "537\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "yang w lee", "city": null, "Name": "stuart e madnick"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Parag Agrawal , Omar Benjelloun , Anish Das Sarma , Chris Hayworth , Shubha Nabar , Tomoe Sugihara , Jennifer Widom, Trio: a system for data, uncertainty, and lineage, Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases, September 12-15, 2006, Seoul, Korea\n", "Agrawal, P., Sarma, A.

Information about the flow of data is introduced subsequently into the workflow and its correctness is independently verified. Improper specification of data requirements of tasks and XOR splits can cause problems such as wrong branching at XOR splits and the failure of tasks to execute. Here we present a graph traversal algorithm called GTforDF for detecting data flow errors in both nested and unstructured workflows, and illustrate its operation on realistic examples. Two of these have interconnected loops and are free of control flow errors, and the third one is an unstructured loop-free workflow. Our approach extends and generalizes data flow verification methods that have been recently proposed. It also makes use of the concept of corresponding pairs lately introduced in control flow verification. It thus has the potential for development into a unified algorithmic procedure for the concurrent detection of control flow and data flow errors. The correctness of the algorithm has been proved theoretically. It has also been tested experimentally on many examples.", "authors": [{"name": "hema s meda", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658633629"}, {"name": "anup kumar sen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100399308"}, {"name": "amitava bagchi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100213731"}], "title": "On Detecting Data Flow Errors in Workflows", "citations": [{"Name": "Paul Glowalla ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ali Sunyaev", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "32\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "856\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "india", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "indian institute of management calcutta", "city": null, "Name": "hema s meda"}, {"country": "india", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "indian institute of management calcutta", "city": null, "Name": "anup kumar sen"}, {"country": "india", "university": "indian institute of science", "affiliation_string": "indian institute of science education and research", "city": "bangalore", "Name": "amitava bagchi"}]}}, "date": {"month": "July", "year": "2010"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 14": {"references": ["B.

Moreover, this is happening with the direct collaborative participation of people. Wikipedia is a great example. It is an enormous repository of information with free access and open edition, created by the community in a collaborative manner. However, this large amount of information, made available democratically and virtually without any control, raises questions about its quality. In this work, we explore a significant number of quality indicators and study their capability to assess the quality of articles from three Web collaborative digital libraries. Furthermore, we explore machine learning techniques to combine these quality indicators into one single assessment. Through experiments, we show that the most important quality indicators are those which are also the easiest to extract, namely, the textual features related to the structure of the article. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this work is the first that shows an empirical comparison between Web collaborative digital libraries regarding the task of assessing article quality.", "authors": [{"name": "daniel hasan dalip", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81486656684"}, {"name": "marcos andre goncalves", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81325488266"}, {"name": "marco cristo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100176174"}, {"name": "pavel calado", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100287393"}], "title": "Automatic Assessment of Document Quality in Web Collaborative Digital Libraries", "citations": [{"Name": "Hengyi Fu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shuheng Wu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sanghee Oh", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Evaluating answer quality across knowledge domains: using textual and non-textual features in social Q&A", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marisa Vasconcelos ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jussara Almeida ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marcos Gon\u00e7alves", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daniel H.

A statistical text analysis technique based on a shrinkage-based variation of multinomial naive Bayes is applied to a set of free-text discharge diagnoses occurring in a number of hospitalizations. All of these diagnoses were previously coded according to the Spanish Edition of ICD9-CM. We deal with the issue of analyzing the predictive power and robustness of the statistical machine learning algorithm proposed for ICD-9-CM classification. We explore the effect of training the models using both clean and noisy data. In particular our work investigates the extent to which errors in free-text diagnoses propagate to the classification model. A measure of predictive accuracy is calculated for the text classification algorithm under analysis. Subsequently, the quality of the sample data is incrementally deteriorated by simulating errors in the text and/or codes. The predictive accuracy is recomputed for each of the noisy samples for comparison purposes. Our research shows that the shrinkage-based classifier is a valid alternative to automate ICD9-CM coding even under circumstances in which the quality of the training data is in question.", "authors": [{"name": "eitel j m lauria", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100618803"}, {"name": "alan d march", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81492644516"}], "title": "Combining Bayesian Text Classification and Shrinkage to Automate Healthcare Coding: A Data Quality Analysis", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "74\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "592\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "marist college poughkeepsie ny", "city": null, "Name": "eitel j m lauria"}, {"country": "Argentina", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "hospital universitario austral buenos aires argentina", "city": "buenos aires", "Name": "alan d march"}]}}, "date": {"month": "December", "year": "2011"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Albrecht, A.2001.

The fact that an impostor can pass as the genuine user by possession of stolen identification information is a weakness in current authentication systems. Adding a biometric layer to the traditional knowledge and token-based authentication systems is one way to counter this problem. Physical biometrics, such as fingerprint systems, are highly accurate; hence, they would be the first choice for such applications but are often inappropriate. Behavioral biometrics, like biometric typing patterns, have the potential to fill this gap as another level of security but this research identified some deficiencies in performance quality. Two research streams for improvements have emerged. The first approach attempts to improve performance by building better classifiers, while the second attempts to attain the same goal by using richer identifying inputs. Both streams assume that the typing biometric patterns are stable over time. This study investigates the validity of this assumption by analyzing how students\u2019 typing patterns behave over time. The results demonstrate that typing patterns change over time due to learning resulting in several performance quality challenges. First, the changing patterns lead to deteriorating authentication accuracy. Second, the relevancy of the reference biometric template created during training becomes questionable. Third, the deterioration in accuracy compromises the security of the whole system and fourth, the net effect brings to question whether the biometric keypad is no longer \u201cfit for use\u201d as an authentication system. These are critical data quality issues that need to be addressed if behavioral biometrics are to play a significant role in minimizing authentication fraud. Possible solutions to the problem, including biometric template updating and choice of uncorrelated PIN combinations, are suggested as potential topics for future research.", "authors": [{"name": "benjamin ngugi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81438596762"}, {"name": "beverly k kahn", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100452955"}, {"name": "marilyn tremaine", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100180541"}], "title": "Typing Biometrics: Impact of Human Learning on Performance Quality", "citations": [{"Name": "Pilsung Kang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sungzoon Cho", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Keystroke dynamics-based user authentication using long and free text strings from various input devices", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "64\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "887\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "suffolk university", "city": null, "Name": "benjamin ngugi"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "suffolk university", "city": null, "Name": "beverly k kahn"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "rutgers university", "city": null, "Name": "marilyn tremaine"}]}, "Article No.: 8": {"references": ["Shawkat Ali , Kate A.

In this study we focus on the four dimensions of data quality noted as the most important to information consumers, namely accuracy, completeness, consistency, and timeliness. These dimensions are of particular concern for operational systems, and most importantly for data warehouses, which are often used as the primary data source for analyses such as classification, a general type of data mining. However, the definitions and conceptual models of these dimensions have not been collectively considered with respect to data mining in general or classification in particular. Nor have they been considered for problem complexity. Conversely, these four dimensions of data quality have only been indirectly addressed by data mining research. Using definitions and constructs of data quality dimensions, our research evaluates the effects of both data quality and problem complexity on generated data and tests the results in a real-world case. Six different classification outcomes selected from the spectrum of classification algorithms show that data quality and problem complexity have significant main and interaction effects. From the findings of significant effects, the economics of higher data quality are evaluated for a frequent application of classification and illustrated by the real-world case.", "authors": [{"name": "roger blake", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81481648048"}, {"name": "paul mangiameli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100611911"}], "title": "The Effects and Interactions of Data Quality and Problem Complexity on Classification", "citations": [{"Name": "Veda C.

Such name ambiguity decreases the performance of document retrieval, Web search, information integration, and may cause confusion in other applications. Due to the same name spellings and lack of information, it is a nontrivial task to distinguish them accurately. In this article, we focus on investigating the problem in digital libraries to distinguish publications written by authors with identical names. We present an effective framework named GHOST (abbreviation for GrapHical framewOrk for name diSambiguaTion), to solve the problem systematically. We devise a novel similarity metric, and utilize only one type of attribute (i.e., coauthorship) in GHOST. Given the similarity matrix, intermediate results are grouped into clusters with a recently introduced powerful clustering algorithm calledAffinity Propagation. In addition, as a complementary technique, user feedback can be used to enhance the performance. We evaluated the framework on the real DBLP and PubMed datasets, and the experimental results show that GHOST can achieve both highprecisionandrecall.", "authors": [{"name": "xiaoming fan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384593961"}, {"name": "jianyong wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451601319"}, {"name": "xu pu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81481648446"}, {"name": "lizhu zhou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100264798"}, {"name": "bing lv", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384616463"}], "title": "On Graph-Based Name Disambiguation", "citations": [{"Name": "Alan Filipe Santana ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marcos Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alberto H.

An understanding of this relationship can improve the efficiency of data management and increase the accuracy and utility of information in problem-solving settings. Nonetheless, our understanding of that relationship is still partial. In fact, even the sign of the relationship is not well understood. Nearly all researchers have embraced the popular belief in GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out), which indicates a strong positive link between input accuracy and output accuracy. However, there is evidence that hints to a more complex association. This article addresses the relationship between input accuracy and output accuracy, particularly the sign of that relationship, in satisficing decisions that apply a conjunctive or disjunctive rule for combining selected criteria. Analysis of a simple scenario shows a surprising result: the sign of that relationship varies; higher input accuracy can lead to lower output accuracy. This article derives criteria that determine the sign of the relationship and explains and illustrates conditions in which the sign is negative. The findings of this research imply certain rules for guiding data quality management resource allocation and design decisions in similar scenarios.", "authors": [{"name": "irit askira gelman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100031647"}], "title": "GIGO or not GIGO: The Accuracy of Multi-Criteria Satisficing Decisions", "citations": [{"Name": "Irit Askira Gelman", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "36\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "331\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": []}}, "date": {"month": "February", "year": "2011"}}}, "Volume1": {"Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 8": {"references": ["Charu C.

A challenging issue in this application area is the restricted quality of sensor data due to limited sensor precision and sensor failures. Moreover, data stream processing to meet resource constraints in streaming environments introduces additional noise and decreases the data quality. In order to avoid wrong business decisions due to dirty data, quality characteristics have to be captured, processed, and provided to the respective business task. However, the issue of how to efficiently provide applications with information about data quality is still an open research problem.In this article, we address this problem by presenting a flexible model for the propagation and processing of data quality. The comprehensive analysis of common data stream processing operators and their impact on data quality allows a fruitful data evaluation and diminishes incorrect business decisions.

Database query languages such as SQL and XQuery offer a concise and high-level means by which such analyses can be implemented, facilitating the extraction of relevant data subsets into either generic or bespoke data analysis environments. Unfortunately, the quality of data in these repositories is often highly variable. The data is still useful, but only if the consumer is aware of the data quality problems and can work around them. Standard query languages offer little support for this aspect of data management. In principle, however, it should be possible to embed constraints describing the consumer\u2019s data quality requirements into the query directly, so that the query evaluator can take over responsibility for enforcing them during query processing.Most previous attempts to incorporate information quality constraints into database queries have been based around a small number of highly generic quality measures, which are defined and computed by the information provider. This is a useful approach in some application areas but, in practice, quality criteria are more commonly determined by the user of the information not by the provider. In this article, we explore an approach to incorporating quality constraints into database queries where the definition of quality is set by the user and not the provider of the information. Our approach is based around the concept of aquality view, a configurable quality assessment component into which domain-specific notions of quality can be embedded. We examine how quality views can be incorporated into XQuery, and draw from this the language features that are required in general to embed quality views into any query language. We also propose some syntactic sugar on top of XQuery to simplify the process of querying with quality constraints.", "authors": [{"name": "suzanne m embury", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100628057"}, {"name": "paolo missier", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100381213"}, {"name": "sandra sampaio", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100610421"}, {"name": "r mark greenwood", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100338898"}, {"name": "alun d preece", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100078737"}], "title": "Incorporating Domain-Specific Information Quality Constraints into Database Queries", "citations": [{"Name": "Xin Luna Dong ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Barna Saha ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Divesh Srivastava", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sandra de F.

Existing record-linkage decision methodologies use the outcomes from the comparisons of the whole set of attributes. Here, we propose an alternative scheme that assesses the attributes sequentially, allowing for a decision to made at any attribute\u2019s comparison stage, and thus before exhausting all available attributes. The scheme we develop is optimum in that it minimizes a well-defined average cost criterion while the corresponding optimum solution can be easily mapped into a decision tree to facilitate the record-linkage decision process. Experimental results performed in real datasets indicate the superiority of our methodology compared to existing approaches.", "authors": [{"name": "george v moustakides", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100342215"}, {"name": "vassilios s verykios", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100646144"}], "title": "Optimal Stopping: A Record-Linkage Approach", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "16\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "588\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "greece", "university": "university of patras", "affiliation_string": "university of patras greece", "city": "patrai", "Name": "george v moustakides"}, {"country": "greece", "university": "university of thessaly", "affiliation_string": "university of thessaly greece", "city": "komotini", "Name": "vassilios s verykios"}]}}, "date": {"month": "September", "year": "2009"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Tarek K.

Hitherto, companies have mostly assigned accountabilities for DQM to Information Technology (IT) departments. They have thereby neglected the organizational issues critical to successful DQM. With data governance, however, companies may implement corporate-wide accountabilities for DQM that encompass professionals from businessandIT departments. This research aims at starting a scientific discussion on data governance by transferring concepts from IT governance and organizational theory to the previously largely ignored field of data governance. The article presents the first results of a community action research project on data governance comprising six international companies from various industries. It outlines a data governance model that consists of three components (data quality roles, decision areas, and responsibilities), which together form a responsibility assignment matrix. The data governance model documents data quality roles and their type of interaction with DQM activities. In addition, the article describes a data governance contingency model and demonstrates the influence of performance strategy, diversification breadth, organization structure, competitive strategy, degree of process harmonization, degree of market regulation, and decision-making style on data governance. Based on these findings, companies can structure their specific data governance model.", "authors": [{"name": "kristin weber", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435604784"}, {"name": "boris otto", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418597725"}, {"name": "hubert osterle", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100209049"}], "title": "One Size Does Not Fit All---A Contingency Approach to Data Governance", "citations": [{"Name": "Andre Montoia Barata ", "Country": "brazil", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Edmir Parada Vasques Prado", "Country": "brazil", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Data Governance in Brazilian Organizations", "Country": "brazil", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Veda C.

The former is the number of cells in error divided by the total number of cells; the latter is the number of correct cells divided by the total number of cells. However, databases may have similar error rates (or accuracy percentages) but differ drastically in the complexity of their accuracy problems. A simple percent does not provide information as to whether the errors are systematic or randomly distributed throughout the database. We expand the accuracy metric to include a randomness measure and include a probability distribution value. The proposed randomness check is based on the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity measure. Through two simulation studies we show that the LZ complexity measure can clearly differentiate as to whether the errors are random or systematic. This determination is a significant first step and is a major departure from the percentage-alone technique. Once it is determined that the errors are random, a probability distribution, Poisson, is used to help address various managerial questions.", "authors": [{"name": "craig w fisher", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100550044"}, {"name": "eitel j m lauria", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100618803"}, {"name": "carolyn c matheus", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453606183"}], "title": "An Accuracy Metric: Percentages, Randomness, and Probabilities", "citations": [{"Name": "Helen-Tadesse Moges ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Karel Dejaeger ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wilfried Lemahieu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bart Baesens", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "53\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "912\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "marist college", "city": null, "Name": "craig w fisher"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "marist college", "city": null, "Name": "eitel j m lauria"}, {"country": "United Kingdom", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "state university of new york at albany", "city": "york", "Name": "carolyn c matheus"}]}, "Article No.: 15": {"references": ["Ahituv, N. 1980.

Quantitative assessment can help define realistic quality improvement targets, track progress, evaluate the impacts of different solutions, and prioritize improvement efforts accordingly. This study describes a methodology for quantitatively assessing both impartialandcontextual data quality in large datasets. Impartial assessment measures the extent to which a dataset is defective, independent of the context in which that dataset is used. Contextual assessment, as defined in this study, measures the extent to which the presence of defects reduces a dataset\u2019s utility, the benefits gained by using that dataset in a specific context. The dual assessment methodology is demonstrated in the context of Customer Relationship Management (CRM), using large data samples from real-world datasets. The results from comparing the two assessments offer important insights for directing quality maintenance efforts and prioritizing quality improvement solutions for this dataset. The study describes the steps and the computation involved in the dual-assessment methodology and discusses the implications for applying the methodology in other business contexts and data environments.", "authors": [{"name": "adir even", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309499570"}, {"name": "g shankaranarayanan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81447595749"}], "title": "Dual Assessment of Data Quality in Customer Databases", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "274\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "17\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "2607\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ben-gurion university of the negev", "city": null, "Name": "adir even"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "babson college", "city": null, "Name": "g shankaranarayanan"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Donald P.

In this article, robust watermarking is used to embed content-based fragile signatures in multimedia signals to achieve efficient authentication without requiring any third-party reference or side information. To overcome the signature alteration caused by the embedding perturbation and other possible encoding operations, a closed-form compensation technique is proposed for ensuring signature consistency by employing a Lagrangian-based approach. A minimum distortion criterion is used to ensure signal quality. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is investigated with simulations of examples of image authentication in which signatures are designed to reveal tamper localization. Results using quantitative performance criteria show successful authentication over a range of robustness in embedding watermarks using both QIM-DM and spread-spectrum techniques. A comparison with two iterative compensation schemes is also presented.", "authors": [{"name": "sufyan ababneh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436592957"}, {"name": "rashid ansari", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100305485"}, {"name": "ashfaq khokhar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100219998"}], "title": "Compensated Signature Embedding for Multimedia Content Authentication", "citations": [{"Name": "Xinglei Zhu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chang W.
