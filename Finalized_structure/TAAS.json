Existing green data center designs often yield suboptimal performance as they only look at a certain specific type of energy source. This article explores data centers powered by hybrid renewable energy systems. We propose GreenWorks, a framework for HPC data centers running on a renewable energy mix. Specifically, GreenWorks features a cross-layer power management scheme tailored to the timing behaviors and capacity constraints of different energy sources. Using realistic workload traces and renewable energy data, we show that GreenWorks could provide a near-optimal workload performance (within 3&percnt; difference) on average. It can also reduce the worst-case performance degradation by 43&percnt; compared to the state-of-the-art design. Moreover, the performance improvements are based on carbon-neutral operations and are not at the cost of significant efficiency degradation and reduced battery lifecycle. Our technique becomes more efficient when servers become more energy proportional and can effectively handle the ever-increasing depth of renewable power penetration in green data centers.", "authors": [{"name": "chao li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81485652152"}, {"name": "rui wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81387593574"}, {"name": "depei qian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323495080"}, {"name": "tao li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100475528"}], "title": "Managing Server Clusters on Renewable Energy Mix", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "66\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "43\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "66\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Kyrgyzstan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "shanghai jiao tong university shanghai china", "city": "tong", "Name": "chao li"}, {"country": "China", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "beihang university beijing china", "city": "beijing", "Name": "rui wang"}, {"country": "China", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "beihang university beijing china", "city": "beijing", "Name": "depei qian"}, {"country": "Uruguay", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of florida fl united states", "city": "florida", "Name": "tao li"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Amr Ali-Eldin and Jan van den Berg. 2014.

The challenge is that users\u2019 individual privacy preferences for the same item may conflict, so an approach that simply merges in some way the users\u2019 privacy preferences may provide unsatisfactory results. Previous proposals to deal with the problem were either time-consuming or did not consider compromises to solve these conflicts (e.g., by considering unilaterally imposed approaches only). We propose a negotiation mechanism for users to agree on a compromise for these conflicts. The second challenge we address in this article relates to the exponential complexity of such a negotiation mechanism. To address this, we propose heuristics that reduce the complexity of the negotiation mechanism and show how substantial benefits can be derived from the use of these heuristics through extensive experimental evaluation that compares the performance of the negotiation mechanism with and without these heuristics. Moreover, we show that one such heuristic makes the negotiation mechanism produce results fast enough to be used in actual social media infrastructures with near-optimal results.", "authors": [{"name": "jose m such", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100649938"}, {"name": "michael rovatsos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100634120"}], "title": "Privacy Policy Negotiation in Social Media", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "74\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "40\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "74\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United Kingdom", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "lancaster university lancaster uk", "city": "lancaster", "Name": "jose m such"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of edinburgh", "affiliation_string": "university of edinburgh uk", "city": "edinburgh", "Name": "michael rovatsos"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Michael Armbrust, Armando Fox, Rean Griffith, Anthony D.

The design of a mechanism that efficiently prices perishable cloud resources in line with a provider\u2019s profit maximization goal remains an open research challenge, however. In this article, we propose the Online Extended Consensus Revenue Estimate mechanism in the setting of a recurrent, multiunit and single price auction for IaaS cloud resources. The mechanism is envy-free, has a high probability of being truthful, and generates a near optimal profit for the provider. We combine the proposed auction design with a scheme for dynamically calculating reserve prices based on data center Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) and electricity costs. Our simulation-based evaluation of the mechanism demonstrates its effectiveness under a broad variety of market conditions. In particular, we show how it improves on the classical uniform price auction, and we investigate the value of prior knowledge on the execution time of virtual machines for maximizing profit. We also developed a system prototype and conducted a small-scale experimental study with a group of 10 users that confirms the truthfulness property of the mechanism in a real test environment.", "authors": [{"name": "adel nadjaran toosi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490666876"}, {"name": "kurt vanmechelen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384601283"}, {"name": "farzad khodadadi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658981939"}, {"name": "rajkumar buyya", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100342317"}], "title": "An Auction Mechanism for Cloud Spot Markets", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "51\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "18\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "51\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "australia", "university": "university of melbourne", "affiliation_string": "university of melbourne australia", "city": "melbourne", "Name": "adel nadjaran toosi"}, {"country": "Belgium", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of antwerp belgium", "city": "antwerp", "Name": "kurt vanmechelen"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "university of melbourne", "affiliation_string": "university of melbourne australia", "city": "melbourne", "Name": "farzad khodadadi"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "university of melbourne", "affiliation_string": "university of melbourne australia", "city": "melbourne", "Name": "rajkumar buyya"}]}}, "date": {"month": "February", "year": "2016"}}}, "Volume4": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Article No.: 22": {"references": ["Albert, R., Jeong, H., and Barabasi, A. 2001.

Based on the observation that various biological systems have already satisfied these requirements, this article proposes and evaluates a biologically-inspired framework that makes network applications to be autonomous, scalable, adaptive, and survivable. With the proposed framework, called iNet, each network application is designed as a decentralized group of software agents, analogous to a bee colony (application) consisting of multiple bees (agents). Each agent provides a particular functionality of a network application, and implements biological behaviors such as reproduction, migration, energy exchange, and death. iNet is designed after the mechanisms behind how the immune system detects antigens (e.g., viruses) and produces specific antibodies to eliminate them. It models a set of environment conditions (e.g., network traffic and resource availability) as an antigen and an agent behavior (e.g., migration) as an antibody. iNet allows each agent to autonomously sense its surrounding environment conditions (an antigen) to evaluate whether it adapts well to the sensed environment, and if it does not, adaptively perform a behavior (an antibody) suitable for the environment conditions. In iNet, a configuration of antibodies is encoded as a set of genes, and antibodies evolve via genetic operations such as crossover and mutation. Empirical measurement results show that iNet is lightweight enough. Simulation results show that agents adapt to dynamic and heterogeneous network environments by evolving their antibodies across generations. The results also show that iNet allows agents to scale to workload volume and network size and to survive partial link failures in the network.", "authors": [{"name": "chonho lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81317497108"}, {"name": "junichi suzuki", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81337493917"}], "title": "An immunologically-inspired autonomic framework for self-organizing and evolvable network applications", "citations": [{"Name": "Raymond Carroll ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sasitharan Balasubramaniam ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Junichi Suzuki ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chonho Lee ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "William Donnelly ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dmitri Botvich", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fran\u00e7oise Andr\u00e9 ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ivona Brandic ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Erwan Daubert ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Guillaume Gauvrit ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Maurizio Giordano ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gabor Kecskemeti ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Attila Kert\u00e9sz ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Claudia Di Napoli ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zsolt Nemeth ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jean-Louis Pazat ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Harald Psaier ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wolfgang Renz ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jan Sudeikat", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Architectures & infrastructure", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "16\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "438\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of massachusetts boston ma", "city": "boston", "Name": "chonho lee"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of massachusetts boston ma", "city": "boston", "Name": "junichi suzuki"}]}, "Article No.: 23": {"references": ["Magdalena Balazinska , Hari Balakrishnan , David Karger, INS/Twine: A Scalable Peer-to-Peer Architecture for Intentional Resource Discovery, Proceedings of the First International Conference on Pervasive Computing, p.195-210, August 26-28, 2002\n", "Kenneth P.

We show that if memory and bandwidth are bounded at moving objects, then the problem of determining whether a set of data items can be disseminated to all the moving objects is NP-complete. For a heuristic solution we postulate that a moving object should save and transmit the data items that are most likely to be new (i.e., previously unknown) to future encountered moving objects. We propose a method to be used by each moving object to prioritize data items based on their probabilities of being new to future receivers. The method employs a machine learning system for estimation of the novelty probability and the machine learning system is progressively trained by received data items. Through simulations based on real mobility traces, we show the superiority of the method against some natural alternatives.", "authors": [{"name": "bo xu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100196086"}, {"name": "ouri wolfson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100392632"}, {"name": "channah naiman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100030572"}], "title": "Machine learning in disruption-tolerant MANETs", "citations": [{"Name": "Veeramani Mahendran ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Thammana Praveen ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "C.

As the system normality is constructed solely from an observed sample of normally occurring patterns, anomaly detectors always suffer excessive false alerts. Adaptability is therefore a desirable feature that enables an anomaly detector to alleviate, if not eliminate, such annoyance. To achieve that, we either design self-learning anomaly detectors to capture the drifts of system normality or develop postprocessing mechanisms to deal with the outputs. As the former methodology is usually scenario- and application-specific, in this article, we focus on the latter one. In particular, our design starts from three key observations: (1) most of anomaly detectors are threshold based and parametric, that is, configurable by a set of parameters; (2) anomaly detectors differ in operational environment and operational capability in terms of detection coverage and blind spots; (3) an intrusive anomaly may leave traces across multiple system layers, incurring different observable events of interest. Firstly, we present a statistical framework to formally characterize and analyze the basic behaviors of anomaly detectors by examining the properties of their operational environments. The framework then serves as a theoretical basis for developing an adaptive middleware, which is called M-AID, to optimally integrate a number of observation-specific parameterizable anomaly detectors. Specifically, M-AID treats these fine-grained anomaly detectors as a whole and casts their collective behaviors in a framework which is formulated as a Multiagent Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (MPO-MDP). The generic anomaly detection models of M-AID are thus automatically inferred via a reinforcement learning algorithm which dynamically adjusts the behaviors of anomaly detectors in accordance with a reward signal that is defined and quantified by a suit of evaluation metrics. Fundamentally, the distributed and autonomous architecture enables M-AID to be scalable, dependable, and adaptable, and the reward signal allows security administrators to specify cost factors and take into account the operational context for taking rational response. Finally, a host-based prototype of M-AID is developed, along with comprehensive experimental evaluation and comparative studies.", "authors": [{"name": "zonghua zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309483703"}, {"name": "hong shen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81327491417"}], "title": "M-AID: An adaptive middleware built upon anomaly detectors for intrusion detection and rational response", "citations": [{"Name": "Arild B.

The self-configuring and self-optimizing procedures of the proposed autonomic scheme are modeled using game theory.

On the other hand,sensing coverage, an intrinsic architectural feature of WSNs plays an important role in meeting application-specific requirements, for example, to reliably extract relevant data about a sensed field. Sensing coverage and network connectivity are not quite orthogonal concepts. In fact, it has been proven that connectivity strongly depends on coverage and hence considerable attention has been paid to establish tighter connection between them although only loose lower bound on network connectivity of WSNs is known. In this article, we investigate connectivity based on the degree of sensing coverage by studyingk-coveredWSNs, where every location in the field is simultaneously covered (or sensed) by at leastksensors (property known ask-coverage, wherekis thedegree of coverage). We observe that to derive network connectivity ofk-covered WSNs, it is necessary to compute the sensor spatial density required to guaranteek-coverage. More precisely, we propose to use a model, called theReuleaux Triangle, to characterizek-coverage with the help of Helly's Theorem and the analysis of the intersection of sensing disks ofksensors. Using a deterministic approach, we show that the sensor spatial density to guaranteek-coverage of a convex field is proportional tokand inversely proportional to the sensing range of the sensors. We also prove that network connectivity ofk-covered WSNs is higher than their sensing coveragek. Furthermore, we propose a new measure of fault tolerance fork-covered WSNs, calledconditional fault tolerance, based on the concepts ofconditional connectivityandforbidden faulty sensor setthat includes all the neighbors of a given sensor. We prove thatk-covered WSNs can sustain a large number of sensor failures provided that the faulty sensor set does not include a forbidden faulty sensor set.", "authors": [{"name": "habib m ammari", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100528894"}, {"name": "sajal k das", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350578589"}], "title": "Fault tolerance measures for large-scale wireless sensor networks", "citations": [{"Name": "A.

However, WSNs are typically composed of low-cost devices and tend to be unreliable, with failures a common phenomenon. Accurate knowledge of network health status, including nodes and links of each type, is critical for correctly configuring applications on WSN testbeds and for interpreting the data collected from them.In this article we present a stabilizing protocol, Chowkidar, that provides accurate and efficient network health monitoring in WSNs. Our approach adapts the well-known problem of message-passing rooted spanning tree construction and its use in propagation of information with feedback (PIF) for the case of a WSN. The Chowkidar protocol is initiated upon demand; that is, it does not involve ongoing maintenance, and it terminates with accurate results, including detection of failure and restart during the monitoring process. Chowkidar is distinguished from others in two important ways. Given the resource constraints of WSNs, it is message-efficient in that it uses only a few messages per node. Also, it tolerates ongoing node and link failure and node restart, in contrast to requiring that faults stop during convergence.We have implemented the Chowkidar protocol as part of enabling a network health status service that is tightly integrated with a remotely accessible wireless sensor network testbed, Kansei, at The Ohio State University. We present experimental results from this testbed that validate the correctness and performance of Chowkidar. We also report on initial experiences and lessons learnt from the integration of Chowkidar with Kansei, including feedback from both testbed users and administrators who have found Chowkidar to be a useful tool for improving the accuracy and efficiency of testbed experimentation and maintenance, and the need for well-defined policies to address issues such as minimizing interference with concurrently running experiments. Finally, we discuss extensions that enhance the functionality and usability of Chowkidar.", "authors": [{"name": "s bapat", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81488647234"}, {"name": "w leal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81488651622"}, {"name": "t kwon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451594353"}, {"name": "p wei", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81460648342"}, {"name": "a arora", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81488656086"}], "title": "Chowkidar: Reliable and scalable health monitoring for wireless sensor network testbeds", "citations": [{"Name": "Sally K.

In such models, events in the computation can only be caused by message receptions, but not by the passage of time. Hutle and Widder [2005a] have shown that there is no deterministic message-driven self-stabilizing implementation of the eventually strong failure detector and thus \u03a9 in systems with uncertainty in message delays and channels of unknown capacity using only bounded space. Under stronger assumptions it was shown that even the eventually perfect failure detector can be implemented in message-driven systems consisting of at leastf+ 2 processes (fbeing the upper bound on the number of processes that crash during an execution).In this article we show thatf+ 2 is in fact a lower bound in message-driven systems, even if nonstabilizing algorithms are considered. This contrasts time-driven models wheref+ 1 is sufficient for failure detector implementations.Moreover, we investigate algorithms where not all processes send message, that is, are active, but some (in a predetermined set) remain passive. Here, we show that thef+ 2 processes required for message-driven systems must be active, while in time-driven systems it suffices thatfprocesses are active.We also provide message-driven implementations of \u03a9. Our algorithms are efficient in the sense that not all processes have to send messages forever, which is an improvement to previous message-driven failure detector implementations.", "authors": [{"name": "martin biely", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413604068"}, {"name": "josef widder", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81335499668"}], "title": "Optimal message-driven implementations of omega with mute processes", "citations": [{"Name": "Toshimitsu Masuzawa ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Taisuke Izumi ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yoshiaki Katayama ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Koichi Wada", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "11\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "227\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "austria", "university": "technische universitat wien", "affiliation_string": "technische universitat wien austria", "city": "vienna", "Name": "martin biely"}, {"country": "france", "university": "ecole polytechnique", "affiliation_string": "ecole polytechnique technische universitat wien austria", "city": "palaiseau", "Name": "josef widder"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["Noa Agmon , David Peleg, Fault-Tolerant Gathering Algorithms for Autonomous Mobile Robots, SIAM Journal on Computing, v.36 n.1, p.56-82, 2006[doi>10.1137/050645221]\n", "Ando, H., Oasa, Y., Suzuki, I., and Yamashita, M. 1999.

This problem is often illustrated by the gathering problem, where the robots must self-organize and meet at some location not determined in advance, and without the help of some global coordinate system. While very simple to express, this problem has the advantage of retaining the inherent difficulty of agreement, namely the question of breaking symmetry between robots. In previous works, it has been proved that the gathering problem is solvable in asynchronous model with oblivious (i.e., memory-less) robots and limited visibility, as long as the robots share the knowledge of some direction, as provided by a compass. However, the problem has no solution in the semi-synchronous model when robots do not share a compass, or when they cannot detect multiplicity.In this article, we define a model in which compasses may be unreliable, and study the solvability of gathering oblivious mobile robots with limited visibility in the semi-synchronous model. In particular, we give an algorithm that solves the problem in finite time in a system where compasses are unstable for some arbitrary long periods, provided that they stabilize eventually. In addition, we show that our algorithm solves the gathering problem for at most three robots in the asynchronous model. Our algorithm is intrinsically self-stabilizing.", "authors": [{"name": "samia souissi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100311605"}, {"name": "xavier defago", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100578487"}, {"name": "masafumi yamashita", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100617910"}], "title": "Using eventually consistent compasses to gather memory-less mobile robots with limited visibility", "citations": [{"Name": "Shantanu Das ", "Country": "switzerland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Paola Flocchini ", "Country": "switzerland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nicola Santoro ", "Country": "switzerland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Masafumi Yamashita", "Country": "switzerland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Linda Pagli ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Giuseppe Prencipe ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Giovanni Viglietta", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "19\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "331\n", "Citation Count": "17\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "japan", "university": "japan advanced institute of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "japan advanced institute of science and technology jaist ishikawa japan", "city": "ishikawa", "Name": "samia souissi"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "japan advanced institute of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "japan advanced institute of science and technology jaist ishikawa japan", "city": "ishikawa", "Name": "xavier defago"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "kyushu university", "affiliation_string": "kyushu university fukuoka japan", "city": "fukuoka", "Name": "masafumi yamashita"}]}}, "date": {"month": "January", "year": "2009"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 19": {"references": ["Akyildiz, I.

This is especially essential to large-scale multihop wireless networks (e.g., wireless sensor networks). Fault-tolerant topology control has been studied recently. In order to achieve both sparseness (i.e., the number of links is linear with the number of nodes) and fault tolerance (i.e., can survive certain level of node/link failures), different geometric topologies were proposed and used as the underlying network topologies for wireless networks. However, most of the existing topology control algorithms can only be applied to two-dimensional (2D) networks where all nodes are distributed in a 2D plane. In practice, wireless networks may be deployed in three-dimensional (3D) space, such as under water wireless sensor networks in ocean or mobile ad hoc networks among space shuttles in space. This article seeks to investigate self-organizing fault-tolerant topology control protocols for large-scale 3D wireless networks. Our new protocols not only guaranteek-connectivity of the network, but also ensure the bounded node degree and constant power stretch factor even underk\u22121 node failures. All of our proposed protocols are localized algorithms, which only use one-hop neighbor information and constant messages with small time complexity. Thus, it is easy to update the topology efficiently and self-adaptively for large-scale dynamic networks. Our simulation confirms our theoretical proofs for all proposed 3D topologies.", "authors": [{"name": "yu wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81408595487"}, {"name": "lijuan cao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81438593649"}, {"name": "teresa a dahlberg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100497034"}, {"name": "fan li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375598822"}, {"name": "xinghua shi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81421595381"}], "title": "Self-organizing fault-tolerant topology control in large-scale three-dimensional wireless networks", "citations": [{"Name": "Douglas M.

Focusing on traffic-induced dynamics, we examine the open, unexplored question of how serious the BLS issue is and how to effectively address it when the routing metric ETX is used. For a wide range of traffic patterns and network topologies and using both node-oriented and network-wide analysis and experimentation, we discover that the optimal routing structure remains quite stable even though the properties of individual links and routes vary significantly as traffic pattern changes. In cases where the optimal routing structure does change, data-driven link estimation and routing is either guaranteed to converge to the optimal structure or empirically shown to converge to a close-to-optimal structure. These findings provide the foundation for addressing the BLS issue in the presence of traffic-induced dynamics and suggest approaches other than existing ones. These findings also demonstrate that it is possible to maintain an optimal, stable routing structure despite the fact that the properties of individual links and paths vary in response to network dynamics.", "authors": [{"name": "hongwei zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451601211"}, {"name": "lifeng sang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319500745"}, {"name": "anish arora", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100591657"}], "title": "On the convergence and stability of data-driven link estimation and routing in sensor networks", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "12\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "310\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "wayne state university detroit mi", "city": "detroit", "Name": "hongwei zhang"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the ohio state university columbus oh", "city": "columbus", "Name": "lifeng sang"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the ohio state university columbus oh", "city": "columbus", "Name": "anish arora"}]}, "Article No.: 16": {"references": ["Anurag Acharya , M.

Agilla provides a programming model in which applications consist of evolving communities of agents that share a wireless sensor network. Coordination among the agents and access to physical resources are supported by a tuple space abstraction. Agents can dynamically enter and exit a network and can autonomously clone and migrate themselves in response to environmental changes. Agilla's ability to support self-adaptive applications in wireless sensor networks has been demonstrated in the context of several applications, including fire detection and tracking, monitoring cargo containers, and robot navigation. Agilla, the first mobile agent system to operate in resource-constrained wireless sensor platforms, was implemented on top of TinyOS. Agilla's feasibility and efficiency was demonstrated by experimental evaluation on two physical testbeds consisting of Mica2 and TelosB nodes.", "authors": [{"name": "chien-liang fok", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100211443"}, {"name": "gruia-catalin roman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100470433"}, {"name": "chenyang lu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451597457"}], "title": "Agilla: A mobile agent middleware for self-adaptive wireless sensor networks", "citations": [{"Name": "David Lillis ", "Country": "ireland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sean Russell ", "Country": "ireland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dominic Carr ", "Country": "ireland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rem W.

Multiagent distributed resource allocation requires that agents act on limited, localized information with minimum communication overhead in order to optimize the distribution of available resources. When requirements and constraints are dynamic, learning agents may be needed to allow for adaptation. One way of accomplishing learning is to observe past outcomes, using such information to improve future decisions. When limits in agents' memory or observation capabilities are assumed, one must decide on how large should the observation window be. We investigate how this decision influences both agents' and system's performance in the context of a special class of distributed resource allocation problems, namely dispersion games. We show by using several numerical experiments over a specific dispersion game (the Minority Game) that in such scenario an agent's performance is non-monotonically correlated with her memory size when all other agents are kept unchanged. We then provide an information-theoretic explanation for the observed behaviors, showing that a downward causation effect takes place.", "authors": [{"name": "ricardo m araujo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81363595355"}, {"name": "luis c lamb", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100353778"}], "title": "On the use of memory and resources in minority games", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "15\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "369\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Portugal", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "institute of informatics federal university of rio grande do sul porto alegre rs brazil", "city": "porto", "Name": "ricardo m araujo"}, {"country": "Portugal", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "institute of informatics federal university of rio grande do sul porto alegre rs brazil", "city": "porto", "Name": "luis c lamb"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Aristotle research group.

For each application, the approach is to understand the performance dependencies that pervade it and then impose constraints on the possible \u2018spread\u2019 of such dependencies through the application. The mechanisms used for this purpose, termed isolation points, are software abstractions inserted at key program locations: (1) in application interfaces, (2) in middleware implementations for making remote requests, and (3) in the system interfaces used by middleware and applications. This article demonstrates the utility of isolation points by using them to implement higher level abstractions that improve the performance-robustness of representative enterprise applications. The I-Queue abstraction uses isolation points to implement performance-robust messaging, targeting the message queues used in distributed enterprise codes.

These (re-)configuring, troubleshooting, and in general maintenance tasks lead to costly and time-consuming procedures during the operating phase. These problems are primarily due to the open-loop structure often followed in software development. Therefore, there is a high demand for management complexity reduction, management automation, robustness, and achieving all of the desired quality requirements within a reasonable cost and time range during operation. Self-adaptive software is a response to these demands; it is a closed-loop system with a feedback loop aiming to adjust itself to changes during its operation. These changes may stem from the software system'sself(internal causes, e.g., failure) orcontext(external events, e.g., increasing requests from users). Such a system is required tomonitoritself and its context,detectsignificant changes,decidehow to react, andactto execute such decisions. These processes depend on adaptation properties (called self-&ast; properties), domain characteristics (context information or models), and preferences of stakeholders. Noting these requirements, it is widely believed that new models and frameworks are needed to design self-adaptive software. This survey article presents a taxonomy, based on concerns of adaptation, that is,how,what,whenandwhere, towards providing a unified view of this emerging area. Moreover, as adaptive systems are encountered in many disciplines, it is imperative to learn from the theories and models developed in these other areas. This survey article presents a landscape of research in self-adaptive software by highlighting relevant disciplines and some prominent research projects. This landscape helps to identify the underlying research gaps and elaborates on the corresponding challenges.", "authors": [{"name": "mazeiar salehie", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100274060"}, {"name": "ladan tahvildari", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100007067"}], "title": "Self-adaptive software: Landscape and research challenges", "citations": [{"Name": "Raian Ali ", "Country": "hungary", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Carlos Solis ", "Country": "hungary", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mazeiar Salehie ", "Country": "hungary", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Inah Omoronyia ", "Country": "hungary", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bashar Nuseibeh ", "Country": "hungary", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Walid Maalej", "Country": "hungary", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Danny Weyns ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "M.

The proposed framework consists of Component Service Model with Semantics (CoSMoS), Component Runtime Environment (CoRE), and Semantic Graph based Service Composition (SeGSeC). CoSMoS models the semantics of components and contexts of users. CoRE is a middleware to support CoSMoS on various distributed computing technologies. SeGSeC is a mechanism to compose an application by synthesizing its workflow based on the semantics of components and contexts of users. The proposed framework is capable of composing applications requested in a natural language by leveraging the semantic information of components. The proposed framework composes applications differently to individual users based on their contexts and preferences. The proposed framework acquires user preferences from user-specified rules and also via learning. The proposed framework also adapts to dynamic environments by autonomously composing a new application upon detecting context change. This article describes the design and mechanism of the proposed framework, and also presents simulation experiments to evaluate the proposed framework.", "authors": [{"name": "keita fujii", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100333092"}, {"name": "tatsuya suda", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100624420"}], "title": "Semantics-based context-aware dynamic service composition", "citations": [{"Name": "Lisardo Prieto-Gonz\u00e1lez ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gerrit Tamm ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Vladimir Stantchev", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ning Gui ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Vincenzo De Florio ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tom Holvoet", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Aitor Urbieta ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alejandra Gonz\u00e1lez-Beltr\u00e1n ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sonia Ben Mokhtar ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jorge Parra ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Licia Capra ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "M.

MITOS extends the scope of resource management to the dynamic relocation of nomadic users: the system suggests to a user the best location to move to for obtaining a satisfactory quality of service level, when the controlling access point of its current location becomes congested. The system monitors the traffic and user location across the network, and formulates the appropriate relocation proposal urging specific users to move to better locations at reasonable distances.

Self-downloading protocols have the property that, eventually, every user downloads only from other users. Self-downloading is problematic if users disconnect from the system upon completing file downloading, because they only share with other users while connected. Yet, if users continue to arrive at a sufficient rate, self-downloading protocols are possible. One vulnerability of file sharing between users is the possibility that files or segments could be counterfeit or corrupt. Protocols that ared-safe tolerate some number of instances of faulty segments in a file being downloaded, because each segment is downloadeddtimes before being shared.

State information collected via the sensor network also enables these systems to actuate mobile agents so as to achieve surveillance goals, such as target capture and asset protection. But satisfying these goals is complicated by the fact that the track information in a sensor network is routed to mobile agents through multihop wireless communication links and is thus subject to message delays and losses. Stabilization must also be considered in designing pursuer strategies so as to deal with state corruption as well as suboptimal evader strategies.In this article, we formulate optimal pursuit control strategies in the presence of network effects, assuming that target track information has been established locally in the sensor network. We adapt ideas from the theory of differential games to networked games\u2014including ones involving nonperiodic track updates, message losses and message delays\u2014to derive optimal strategies, bounds on the information requirements, and scaling properties of these bounds.

In this network, each sent message is encrypted using one or more symmetric keys that are shared only between two processes: the process that sends the message and the neighboring process that receives the message. A straightforward scheme for assigning symmetric keys to the different processes in such a network is to assign each processO(d) keys, wheredis the maximum number of neighbors of any process in the network. In this article, we present a more efficient scheme for assigning symmetric keys to the different processes in a communication network. This scheme, which is referred to as logarithmic keying, assignsO(logd) symmetric keys to each process in the network. We show that logarithmic keying can be used in rich classes of communication networks that include star networks, acyclic networks, limited-cycle networks, planar networks, and dense bipartite networks. In addition, we present a construction that utilizes efficient keying schemes for general bipartite networks to construct efficient keying schemes for general networks.", "authors": [{"name": "ehab s elmallah", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100453018"}, {"name": "mohamed g gouda", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100067662"}, {"name": "sandeep s kulkarni", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81327489916"}], "title": "Logarithmic keying", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "10\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "227\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "canada", "university": "university of alberta", "affiliation_string": "university of alberta edomonton canada", "city": "edmonton", "Name": "ehab s elmallah"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of texas at austin austin tx", "city": "austin", "Name": "mohamed g gouda"}, {"country": "Cameroon", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "michigan state university east lansing mi", "city": "east", "Name": "sandeep s kulkarni"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["Dana Angluin , James Aspnes , Melody Chan , Michael J.

As an example, we demonstrate the nonstability of the ata standard protocol for storage devices. We state the requirements that an operating system and I/O devices should satisfy in order to become self-stabilizing. Then we suggest two solutions to satisfy these requirements. The first uses leases to guarantee progress from the I/O device side. The second assumes stabilization of the I/O device, and uses snapshots to perform consistency checks. A device driver for a PC hard-disk, using the first solution, was implemented. By supplying an infrastructure for practical self-stabilizing systems, robust and dependable systems can be achieved.", "authors": [{"name": "shlomi dolev", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100628546"}, {"name": "reuven yagel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100279176"}], "title": "Self-stabilizing device drivers", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "10\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "345\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ben-gurion university of the negev beer-sheva israel", "city": "negev", "Name": "shlomi dolev"}, {"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ben-gurion university of the negev beer-sheva israel", "city": "negev", "Name": "reuven yagel"}]}}, "date": {"month": "November", "year": "2008"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Sang Ho Bae , Sung-Ju Lee , W.

However, aggressive power assignment at non-leaf nodes, although conserving more energy, results in multicast trees that suffer from higher hop count and jeopardizes delay-sensitive applications, signifying a clear tradeoff between energy efficiency and delay. This article formulates these issues as aconstrained Steiner treeproblem, and describes a distributed constrained Steiner tree algorithm, which jointly conserves energy and bounds delay for multicast routing in ad hoc networks. In particular, the proposed algorithm concurrently constructs a constrained Steiner tree, performs transmission power assignment at non-leaf nodes, and strives to minimize the sum of transmission power of non-leaf nodes, subject to the given maximum hop count constraint. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and reveal the characteristics of the proposed algorithm.", "authors": [{"name": "chien-chung shen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100343578"}, {"name": "ke li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81540181856"}, {"name": "chaiporn jaikaeo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100446882"}, {"name": "vinay sridhara", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100491686"}], "title": "Ant-based distributed constrained steiner tree algorithm for jointly conserving energy and bounding delay in ad hoc multicast routing", "citations": [{"Name": "Antinisca Di Marco ", "Country": "denmark", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Francesco Gallo ", "Country": "denmark", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Paola Inverardi ", "Country": "denmark", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rodolfo Ippoliti", "Country": "denmark", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "17\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "631\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of delaware newark de", "city": "newark", "Name": "chien-chung shen"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of delaware newark de", "city": "newark", "Name": "ke li"}, {"country": "thailand", "university": "kasetsart university", "affiliation_string": "kasetsart university bangkok thailand", "city": "bangkok", "Name": "chaiporn jaikaeo"}, {"country": "Mali", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "qualcomm san diego ca", "city": "san", "Name": "vinay sridhara"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["Tarek F.

In this article, we propose a novel dynamic provisioning technique for multi-tier Internet applications that employs (1) a flexible queuing model to determine how much of the resources to allocate to each tier of the application, and (2) a combination of predictive and reactive methods that determine when to provision these resources, both at large and small time scales. We propose a novel data center architecture based on virtual machine monitors to reduce provisioning overheads. Our experiments on a forty-machine Xen/Linux-based hosting platform demonstrate the responsiveness of our technique in handling dynamic workloads. In one scenario where a flash crowd caused the workload of a three-tier application to double, our technique was able to double the application capacity within five minutes, thus maintaining response-time targets. Our technique also reduced the overhead of switching servers across applications from several minutes to less than a second, while meeting the performance targets of residual sessions.", "authors": [{"name": "bhuvan urgaonkar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100318035"}, {"name": "prashant shenoy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100334109"}, {"name": "abhishek chandra", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100394408"}, {"name": "pawan goyal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100173956"}, {"name": "timothy wood", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100373372"}], "title": "Agile dynamic provisioning of multi-tier Internet applications", "citations": [{"Name": "C.

In this respect the holonic paradigm provides a solution for modelling complex organizational structures. Holons are defined as self-similar entities that are neither parts nor wholes. The organizational structure produced by holons is called a holarchy. A holonic MAS (HMAS) considers agents as holons that are grouped according to holarchies. The goal of this article is to introduce an architecture that allows holons to adapt to their environment. The metaphor is based upon the immune system and considers stimulations/requests as antigens and selected antibodies as reactions/answers. Each antibody is activated by specific antigens and stimulated and/or inhibited by other antibodies. The immune system rewards (respectively penalizes) selected antibodies, which constitutes a good (respectively wrong) answer to a request. This mechanism allows an agent to choose from a set of possible behaviors, the one that seems the best fit for a specific context. In this context, each holon, atomic or composed, encapsulates an immune system in order to select a behavior. For composed holons, each sub-holon is represented by the selected antibody of its immune system. The super-holon's immune system therefore contains one antibody per sub-holon. This recursive architecture corresponds with the recursive nature of the holarchy. This architecture is presented with an example of simulated robot soccer. From experiments under different conditions we show that this architecture has interesting properties.", "authors": [{"name": "vincent hilaire", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100329468"}, {"name": "abder koukam", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81408595825"}, {"name": "sebastian rodriguez", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350581237"}], "title": "An adaptative agent architecture for holonic multi-agent systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Fernando J.

Concretely, our first contribution is a set of techniques to translate discretesequence equations(also known as difference equations) into new p2p protocols calledsequence protocols. Sequence protocols are self-adaptive, scalable, and fault-tolerant, with applicability in p2p settings like Grids. A sequence protocol is a set of probabilistic local and message-passing actions for each process. These actions are translated from terms in a set of source sequence equations. Individual processes do not simulate the source sequence equations completely. Instead, each process executes probabilistic local and message passing actions, so that the emergent round-to-round behavior of the sequence protocol in a p2p system can be probabilistically predicted by the source sequence equations. The article's second contribution is the design and evaluation of a set of sequence protocols for detection of two global triggers in a distributed system: threshold detection and interval detection. This article's third contribution is a new self-adaptive Grid computing protocol called HoneyAdapt. HoneyAdapt is derived from sequence equations modeling adaptive bee foraging behavior in nature. HoneyAdapt is intended for Grid applications that allow Grid clients, at run-time, a choice of algorithms for executing chunks of the application's dataset. HoneyAdapt tells each Grid client how to adaptively select at run-time, for each chunk it receives, a good algorithm for computing the chunk\u2014this selection is based on continuous feedback from other clients. Finally, we design a variant of HoneyAdapt, called HoneySort, for application to Grid parallelized sorting settings using the master-worker paradigm. Our evaluation of these contributions consists of mathematical analysis, large-scale trace-based simulation results, and experimental results from a HoneySort deployment.", "authors": [{"name": "steven y ko", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100500269"}, {"name": "indranil gupta", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100020135"}, {"name": "yookyung jo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332506603"}], "title": "A new class of nature-inspired algorithms for self-adaptive peer-to-peer computing", "citations": [{"Name": "Gianluigi Folino ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Carlo Mastroianni", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Agostino Forestiero ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Emilio Leonardi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Carlo Mastroianni ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michela Meo", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Agostino Forestiero ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Carlo Mastroianni ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michela Meo", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Steven Y.

The laboratory facilitates the theorization and validation of these properties through an iterative research processes that involves (1) forward simulation experiments, which are used to formalize dynamic group properties, (2) reverse engineering from real data on how the parameters are distributed among individual actors in the community, and (3) grounded research, such as participant observation, that follows specific activities of real actors in a community and determines if, or how well, the micro-laws describe the way choices are made in real world, local settings. In this article we report on the design of ViSAGE. We first give some background to the model. Next we detail each component. We then describe a set of simulation experiments that we used to further design and clarify ViSAGE as a tool for studying emergent properties/phenomena in social networks.", "authors": [{"name": "jeffrey baumes", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81337487648"}, {"name": "hung-ching justin chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451600951"}, {"name": "matthew francisco", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81365594381"}, {"name": "mark goldberg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339501864"}, {"name": "malik magdon-ismail", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100309641"}, {"name": "william wallace", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81408603116"}], "title": "ViSAGE: AVirtual Laboratory forSimulation andAnalysis of SocialGroupEvolution", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "17\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "542\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "rensselaer polytechnic institute", "city": null, "Name": "jeffrey baumes"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "rensselaer polytechnic institute", "city": null, "Name": "hung-ching justin chen"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "rensselaer polytechnic institute", "city": null, "Name": "matthew francisco"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "rensselaer polytechnic institute", "city": null, "Name": "mark goldberg"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "rensselaer polytechnic institute", "city": null, "Name": "malik magdon-ismail"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "rensselaer polytechnic institute", "city": null, "Name": "william wallace"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Agarwal, R. and Joshi, M. 2001.

Current IDS have two main problems: The first problem is that typically so many alarms are generated as to overwhelm the system operator, many of these being false alarms. The second problem is that continuous tuning of the intrusion detection model is required in order to maintain sufficient performance due to the dynamically changing nature of the monitored system. This manual tuning process relies on the system operators to work out the updated tuning solution and to integrate it into the detection model.In this article, we present an automatically tuning intrusion detection system, which controls the number of alarms output to the system operator and tunes the detection model on the fly according to feedback provided by the system operator when false predictions are identified. This system adapts its behavior (i) by throttling the volume of alarms output to the operator in response to the ability of the operator to respond to these alarms, and (ii) by deciding how aggressively the detection model should be tuned based on the accuracy of earlier predictions. We evaluated our system using the KDDCup'99 intrusion detection dataset. Our results show that an adaptive, automatically tuning intrustion detection system will be both practical and efficient.", "authors": [{"name": "zhenwei yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350570223"}, {"name": "jeffrey j p tsai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350591654"}, {"name": "thomas weigert", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100321256"}], "title": "An adaptive automatically tuning intrusion detection system", "citations": [{"Name": "Arild B.

An autonomic network crosses organizational and management boundaries and is provided by entities that see each other just as partners. For many services no autonomic partner may guess a priori what will be sent by clients nor clients know a priori what credentials are required to access a service.To address this problem we propose a newinteractive access control: servers should interact with clients, asking for missing credentials necessary to grant access, whereas clients may supply or decline the requested credentials. Servers evaluate their policies and interact with clients until a decision of grant or deny is taken.This proposal is grounded in a formal model on policy-based access control. It identifies the formal reasoning services of deduction, abduction and consistency. Based on them, the work proposes a comprehensive access control framework for autonomic systems.

In many cases, it is essential to retrieve and process such data in blocks, in order to benefit from pipelined parallelism and reduced communication costs. This article deals with the problem of minimizing at runtime, in a self-managing way, the total response time of a call to a database exposed to a volatile environment, like the Grid, as a WS. Typically, in this scenario, response time exhibits a concave, nonlinear behavior depending on the client-controlled size of the individual requests comprising a fixed size task. In addition, no accurate profiling or internal state information is available, and the optimum point is volatile. This situation is encountered in several systems, such as WS Management Systems (WSMS) for DBMS-like data management over wide area service-based networks, and the widely spread OGSA-DAI WS for accessing and integrating traditional DBMS. The main challenges in this problem apart from the unavailability of a model, include the presence of noise, which incurs local minima, the volatility of the environment, which results in moving optimum operating point, and the requirements for fast convergence to the optimal size of the request from the side of the client rather than of the server, and for low overshooting. Two solutions are presented in this work, which fall into the broader areas of runtime optimization and switching extremum control. They incorporate heuristics to avoid local optimal points, and address all the aforementioned challenges. The effectiveness of the solutions is verified via both empirical evaluation in real cases and simulations, which show that significant performance benefits can be provided rendering obsolete the need for detailed profiling of the WS.", "authors": [{"name": "anastasios gounaris", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100309497"}, {"name": "christos yfoulis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100061624"}, {"name": "rizos sakellariou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100106424"}, {"name": "marios d dikaiakos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100624378"}], "title": "A control theoretical approach to self-optimizing block transfer in Web service grids", "citations": [{"Name": "Steven Lynden ", "Country": "greece", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Isao Kojima ", "Country": "greece", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Akiyoshi Matono ", "Country": "greece", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yusuke Tanimura", "Country": "greece", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Anastasios Gounaris ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Christos A.

A key issue in this context is that of generating groups of agents such that the communication among agents of the same group is not subjected to comprehension problems. To this purpose, several approaches have been proposed in the past in order to form groups of agents based on some similarity measures among agents. Such similarity measures are mainly based on lexical and/or structural similarities among agent ontologies. However, the necessity of taking into account a semantic component of the similarity value arises, for example by considering the context in which a term is used in an agent ontology. Therefore we propose a clustering technique based on the HISENE semantic negotiation protocol, using a similarity value that has lexical, structural and semantic components. Moreover, we introduce a suitable multiagent architecture that allows computing agent similarities by means of an efficient distributed approach.", "authors": [{"name": "salvatore garruzzo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100137272"}, {"name": "domenico rosaci", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100493791"}], "title": "Agent clustering based on semantic negotiation", "citations": [{"Name": "T.

Such algorithms exploit the properties ofswarmsystems, in which a number of entities/agents perform simple operations at the local level, but together engender an advanced form ofswarm intelligenceat the global level. In particular, So-Grid provides two main functionalities: logical reorganization of resources, inspired by the behavior of some species of ants and termites that move and collect items within their environment, and resource discovery, inspired by the mechanisms through which ants searching for food sources are able to follow the pheromone traces left by other ants. These functionalities are correlated, since an intelligent dissemination can facilitate discovery. In the Grid environment, a number of ant-like agents autonomously travel the Grid through P2P interconnections and use biased probability functions to: (i) replicate resource descriptors in order to favor resource discovery; (ii) collect resource descriptors with similar characteristics in nearby Grid hosts; (iii) foster the dissemination of descriptors corresponding tofresh(recently updated) resources and to resources having high quality of service (QoS) characteristics. Simulation analysis shows that the So-Grid replication algorithm is capable of reducing the entropy of the system and efficiently disseminating content. Moreover, as descriptors are progressively reorganized and replicated, the So-Grid discovery algorithm allows users to reach Grid hosts that store information about a larger number of useful resources in a shorter amount of time. The proposed approach features characteristics, including self-organization, scalability and adaptivity, which make it useful for a dynamic and partially unreliable distributed system.", "authors": [{"name": "agostino forestiero", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332498809"}, {"name": "carlo mastroianni", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100481306"}, {"name": "giandomenico spezzano", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100461604"}], "title": "So-Grid: A self-organizing Grid featuring bio-inspired algorithms", "citations": [{"Name": "Gianluigi Folino ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Carlo Mastroianni", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Agostino Forestiero ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Carlo Mastroianni ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michela Meo", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Carlo Mastroianni ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michela Meo ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Giuseppe Papuzzo", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Agostino Forestiero ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Emilio Leonardi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Carlo Mastroianni ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michela Meo", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Agostino Forestiero ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Carlo Mastroianni ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Giuseppe Papuzzo ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Giandomenico Spezzano", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ramachandra Kota ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nicholas Gibbins ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nicholas R.

Routing in ad hoc networks has been explored to a large extent over the past decade and different protocols have been proposed. They are based on a two-dimensional view of the ad hoc network geographical region, and are not always realistic. In this article, we propose a bird flight-inspired, highly scalable, dynamic, energy-efficient, and position-based routing protocol called Bird Flight-Inspired Routing Protocol (BFIRP). The proposed protocol is inspired by the navigation of birds over long distances following the great circle arc, the shortest arc connecting two points on the surface of a sphere. This sheds light on how birds save their energy while navigating over thousands of miles. The proposed algorithm can be readily applied in many real-world applications, as it is designed with a realistic three-dimensional view of the network\u2019s geographic region. In the proposed algorithm, each node obtains its location coordinates (X, Y, Z), and speed from the GPS (Global Positioning System); whereas, the destination\u2019s location coordinates (X, Y, Z), and speed are obtained from any other distributed localized service. Based on the location information, the source and each intermediate node choose their immediate neighbor as the next hop that has the maximum priority. The priority is calculated by taking into consideration the energy of the node, the distance between the node and the destination and the degree of closeness of the node to the trajectory of the great circle arc between the current node and the destination. The proposed algorithm is simulated in J-SIM and compared with the algorithms of Ad Hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV), and Most Forward Within Distance R (MFR) routing protocols. The results of the simulations show that the proposed BFIRP algorithm is highly scalable, and has low end-to-end delay compared to AODV. The algorithm is also simulated in various scenarios, and the results demonstrate that BFIRP is more efficient than AODV in energy and throughput by 20&percnt; and 15&percnt; respectively. It also shows satisfactory improvement over MFR in terms of throughput and routing overhead.", "authors": [{"name": "sudip misra", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330495517"}, {"name": "gopidi rajesh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490657784"}], "title": "Bird Flight-Inspired Routing Protocol for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks", "citations": [{"Name": "Po-Jen Chuang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Teng-Tai Hu", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mallikarjun B.

To circumvent the three computational adversaries (asynchrony, failures, and anonymity) each process is provided with a failure detector of a class denoted\u03c8, that gives it an upper bound on the number of processes that are currently alive (in a nonanonymous system, the classes\u03c8andP---the class of perfect failure detectors---are equivalent).The article first presents a simple\u03c8-based consensus algorithm where the processes decide in 2t+ 1 asynchronous rounds (wheretis an upper bound on the number of faulty processes). It then shows one of its main results, namely 2t+ 1 is a lower bound for consensus in the anonymous systems equipped with\u03c8. The second contribution addresses early-decision. The article presents and proves correct an early-deciding algorithm where the processes decide in min(2f+ 2, 2t+ 1) asynchronous rounds (wherefis the actual number of process failures). This leads us to think that anonymity doubles the cost (with respect to synchronous systems) and it is conjectured that min(2f+ 2, 2t+ 1) is the corresponding lower bound.The article finally considers thek-set agreement problem in anonymous systems. It first shows that the previous\u03c8-based consensus algorithm solves thek-set agreement problem inRt= 2\u230at k\u230b + 1 asynchronous rounds. Then, considering a family of failure detector classes &lcub;\u03c8&ell;&rcub;0 \u2264&ell;<kthat generalizes the class\u03c8(=\u03c80), the article presents an algorithm that solves thek-set agreement inRt,&ell;= 2 \u230at k \u2212 &ell;\u230b + 1 asynchronous rounds. This last formula relates the cost (Rt,&ell;) the coordination degree of the problem (k), the maximum number of failures (t), and the the strength (&ell;) of the underlying failure detector.

Understanding primates\u2019 social and communication systems and applying what is learned from them to engineering domains will likely lead to solutions to a number of problems. Scent-marking is an important behavior among primates and many other mammals. In this article, inspired by primates\u2019 scent-marking activity, we propose and study a collaboration strategy for mobile and static sensors with RFID tags, where mobile sensors can be treated as robots or mobile actuators and can leave information to direct others to find them. Mobile sensors are equipped with RFID tags (or sensors) that can be deployed whenever needed, and RFID tags (or sensors) carry related information for other robots to pick up. We propose several primate-inspired communication mechanisms, including delayed-and-relayed and scent-trail communication among robots. We analytically model and simulate scent-trail communication. We also study a tracking and pursuing scheme of mobile sensors using simulations in terms of robot speeds, searching function, deployment density, turning function, and so on. We assume that robots (mobile sensors or mobile actuators) are capable of deploying/throwing-out sensors/RFID tags.", "authors": [{"name": "yang xiao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81336494102"}, {"name": "yanping zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81444604133"}, {"name": "xiannuan liang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81456622781"}], "title": "Primate-Inspired Communication Methods for Mobile and Static Sensors and RFID Tags", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "23\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "286\n", "Citation Count": "4\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of alabama", "city": null, "Name": "yang xiao"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of alabama", "city": null, "Name": "yanping zhang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of alabama", "city": null, "Name": "xiannuan liang"}]}, "Article No.: 27": {"references": ["Senthilkumar G.

Due to its decentralized and self-organizing nature, P2P malware is harder to detect and block, especially if it utilizes specialized techniques for hiding. We analyze a number of hiding strategies through extensive and realistic simulations over a model of the AS-level Internet topology. We show that the most effective strategy to avoid detection is to drastically reduce the maximal number of peers a node communicates with. While overlay networks of a small constant maximal degree are generally considered to be unscalable, we argue that it is possible to design them to be scalable, efficient, and robust. An important implication is that stealth mode P2P malware that is very difficult to discover with state-of-the-art methods is a plausible threat. We discuss algorithms and theoretical results that support the scalability of stealth mode overlays, and we present realistic event-based simulations of a proof-of-concept system. Besides the context of P2P malware, some of our results are of general interest in the area of constant degree overlays in connection with the problem of how to maintain reasonable performance and reliability with the smallest degree possible.", "authors": [{"name": "mark jelasity", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100513586"}, {"name": "vilmos bilicki", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81317491600"}], "title": "Scalable Stealth Mode P2P Overlays of Very Small Constant Degree", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "15\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "218\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "hungary", "university": "university of szeged", "affiliation_string": "university of szeged and hungarian academy of sciences", "city": "szeged", "Name": "mark jelasity"}, {"country": "hungary", "university": "university of szeged", "affiliation_string": "university of szeged", "city": "szeged", "Name": "vilmos bilicki"}]}, "Article No.: 29": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2019591.2019598", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "manish parashar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100205090"}, {"name": "franco zambonelli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100268981"}], "title": "Editorial", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "3\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "131\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "franco zambonelli", "city": null, "Name": "manish parashar"}]}, "Article No.: 24": {"references": ["Karl Aberer , Zoran Despotovic, Managing trust in a peer-2-peer information system, Proceedings of the tenth international conference on Information and knowledge management, October 05-10, 2001, Atlanta, Georgia, USA[doi>10.1145/502585.502638]\n", "Karl Aberer , Philippe Cudr\u00e9-Mauroux , Anwitaman Datta , Zoran Despotovic , Manfred Hauswirth , Magdalena Punceva , Roman Schmidt, P-Grid: a self-organizing structured P2P system, ACM SIGMOD Record, v.32 n.3, September 2003[doi>10.1145/945721.945729]\n", "Rakesh Agrawal , Evimaria Terzi, On honesty in sovereign information sharing, Proceedings of the 10th international conference on Advances in Database Technology, March 26-31, 2006, Munich, Germany[doi>10.1007/11687238_17]\n", "Emmanuelle Anceaume , Aina Ravoaja, Incentive-based robust reputation mechanism for p2p services, Proceedings of the 10th international conference on Principles of Distributed Systems, p.305-319, December 12-15, 2006, Bordeaux, France[doi>10.1007/11945529_22]\n", "Ronald Ashri , Sarvapali D.

To this end, we describe our novel open infrastructure for building and executing home applications. This includes the amalgamation of the two computing areas of autonomics and service orientation, to produce a component-based platform providing facilities including monitoring, touchpoints, and other common autonomic services. This infrastructure uniquely blends the advantages of distributed autonomic control with global conflict management in a management hierarchy. We discuss this platform in terms of pervasive home systems and show how one would develop such a system for two examples of automated home applications: intruder detection and medical support, respectively. Both applications were built within our framework and evaluated showing that the use of the framework introduces minimal overheads but provides many benefits. We then conclude by highlighting the contributions of AutoHome and a discussion about the lessons learned, limitations, and future research directions.", "authors": [{"name": "johann bourcier", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81322489294"}, {"name": "ada diaconescu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100548357"}, {"name": "philippe lalanda", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100428873"}, {"name": "julie a mccann", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100223499"}], "title": "AutoHome: An Autonomic Management Framework for Pervasive Home Applications", "citations": [{"Name": "Marc-Oliver Pahl ", "Country": "switzerland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Georg Carle", "Country": "switzerland", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "28\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "443\n", "Citation Count": "4\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ada diaconescu", "city": null, "Name": "johann bourcier"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "julie a mccann", "city": null, "Name": "philippe lalanda"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Bakhouya, M.2008.

While anycasting offers better service flexibility in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), it also incurs new problems. In MANETs, every node can move arbitrarily, and the routes from mobile nodes to their service providers would vary. Therefore, anycast service discovery in MANETs usually relies on network-layer message broadcasting, which leads to large traffic overhead for the scarce bandwidth of MANETs. In this work, we present a traffic-control scheme for anycast service discovery in MANETs. Our scheme can reduce the volume of query messages and the reply messages. In addition to basic anycasting, our scheme also supports k-anycast service that requests for k anycast service providers in each service instance. With k-anycast service, the fault tolerance and service flexibility of our scheme can be improved. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme is efficient and feasible for MANETs.", "authors": [{"name": "shyr-kuen chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81481649443"}, {"name": "pi-chung wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100214293"}], "title": "Design and Implementation of an Anycast Services Discovery in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks", "citations": [{"Name": "P.I.

Communication networks form a significant integrant of ubiquitous and pervasive Grids and must be utilized effectively by the Grids. The notion of Grid network service may greatly facilitate integrating networking systems into the Grid architecture, and network service description and discovery play a crucial role in the network-Grid integration. Current service description and discovery technologies must be enhanced to meet the special requirements of network service description and discovery for high-performance ubiquitous and pervasive Grids. Network service description needs a model for service provisioning capability and network service discovery must be able to select those networks that meet certain performance requirements. The wide variety of networking systems in ubiquitous and pervasive Grids require general and flexible network service description and discovery approaches that are applicable to heterogeneous networks. The research presented in this article aims at developing network service description and discovery technologies for high-performance ubiquitous and pervasive Grid computing. The main contributions of this article include a general model for describing service capabilities of various networking systems, a service discovery technology for selecting network services that meet the performance requirements specified by Grid applications, and a resource allocation scheme for Grid network services to provide networking performance guarantees. The developed model and technologies are general and flexible; thus are applicable to the wide variety of heterogeneous networks in ubiquitous and pervasive Grid computing environments.", "authors": [{"name": "qiang duan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100363308"}], "title": "Network Service Description and Discovery for High-Performance Ubiquitous and Pervasive Grids", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "30\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "433\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the pennsylvania state university abington college", "city": null, "Name": "qiang duan"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Apple. 2009.

For fixed networked devices, SDPs such as SLP, Bonjour, and UPnP have been proposed. For more dynamic networked environments such as ad hoc, sensor, and wireless networks, a set of discovery technologies have been designed to operate optimally in such conditions; these include protocols like Ariadne, Allia, GSD, and UDDI. Hence, it is possible to advertise and discover services in diverse network types using one of a suite of technologies. Importantly, there are differences between individual protocols in terms of: (i) service description language, (ii) message format, (iii) directory architecture, (iv) discovery protocol behavior, (v) network communication, and (vi) nonfunctional features. These differences mean it is not possible to discover services with one protocol that is advertised by another and vice versa; we characterize this asservice discovery protocol heterogeneity. In this article, we propose SeDiM, a dynamic middleware solution to allow heterogeneous discovery protocols within and across different domains to interoperate with one another. SeDiM is evaluated within a case study that demonstrates transparent interoperation of protocols including SLP and Bonjour in highly heterogeneous environments.", "authors": [{"name": "carlos flores", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100031158"}, {"name": "paul grace", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100278761"}, {"name": "gordon s blair", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100419003"}], "title": "SeDiM: A Middleware Framework for Interoperable Service Discovery in Heterogeneous Networks", "citations": [{"Name": "Carlos Rodr\u00edguez-Dom\u00ednguez ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kawtar Benghazi ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jos\u00e9 Luis Garrido ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Aurora Valenzuela", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gordon S.

In such cases, it is possible to compose various applications through a combination of different sets of components. Considering the multifaceted problem of having varying device capabilities supporting a different set of protocols, and each device hosting a number of components providing the same functionality, it becomes very difficult to choose a particular device hosting a required component which can be the best-fit for the user. This becomes practically impossible when the required components are distributed across various devices in the networked environment.We propose a solution for dynamic user task composition considering user preferences, device capabilities, and heterogeneity of communication protocols. With our proposed approach, a user task can be instantiated in different environments using a different set of devices and components, depending upon their capabilities and user preferences. We propose mechanisms for modeling device capabilities and user preferences and for modeling the user task as a graph. We then propose algorithms for selection of devices based on user preferences and task requirements. Since the underlying network is also modeled as a graph, we describe an algorithm for mapping of services in the user task on to the components distributed across devices in the pervasive environment. We also give an overview of our initial implementation and some results of our evaluations.", "authors": [{"name": "hamid mukhtar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375609506"}, {"name": "djamel belaid", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81361598732"}, {"name": "guy bernard", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100560605"}], "title": "Dynamic User Task Composition Based on User Preferences", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "32\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "442\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "djamel belaid", "city": null, "Name": "hamid mukhtar"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "guy bernard", "city": null, "Name": "institut telecom telecom sudparis cnrs umr samovar"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "guy bernard", "city": null, "Name": "institut telecom telecom sudparis cnrs umr samovar"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["Alur, R. and Henzinger, T.

With the ever-increasing number of multicast applications made recently, considerable efforts have been focused on the design of adaptive flow control schemes for autonomic multicast services. The main difficulties in designing an adaptive flow controller for autonomic multicast service are caused by heterogeneous multicast receivers, especially those with large propagation delays, since the feedback arriving at the source is somewhat outdated and can be harmful to the control operations.To tackle the preceding problem, this article describes a novel, adaptive, and autonomic multicast scheme, the so-called Proportional, Integrative, Derivative plus Neural Network (PIDNN) predictive technique, which consists of two components: the Proportional Integrative plus Derivative (PID) controller and the Back Propagation BP Neural Network (BPNN). In this integrated scheme, the PID controllers are located at the next upstream main branch nodes of the multicast receivers, and have explicit rate algorithms to regulate the receiving rates of the receivers; while the BPNN is located at the multicast source, and predicts the available bandwidth of those longer delay receivers to compute the expected rates of the longer delay receivers. The ultimate sending rate of the multicast source is the maximum of the aforesaid receiving rates that can be accommodated by its participating branches. This network-assisted property is different from the existing control schemes, in that the PIDNN controller can release the irresponsiveness of a multicast flow caused by those long propagation delays from the receivers. By using BPNN, this active scheme makes the control more responsive to the receivers with longer propagation delay. Thus the rate adaptation can be performed in a timely manner, for the sender to respond to network congestion quickly. We analyze the theoretical aspects of the proposed algorithm, show how the control mechanism can be used to design a controller to support multirate multicast transmission based on feedback of explicit rates, and verify this matching using simulations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PIDNN controller avoids overflow of multicast traffic, and performs better than the existing scheme PNN [Tan et al. 2005] and the multicast schemes based on control theory. Moreover, it also performs well in the sense that it achieves high link utilization, quick response, good scalability, high unitary throughput, intra-session fairness and inter-session fairness.", "authors": [{"name": "naixue xiong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309507139"}, {"name": "athanasios v vasilakos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100083052"}, {"name": "laurence t yang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452592885"}, {"name": "ekram hossain", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81335491507"}], "title": "An adaptive and predictive approach for autonomic multirate multicast networks", "citations": [{"Name": "Ming Cao ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Laurence T.

We also examine and propose engineering methodologies to further tailor an event-based system to facilitate its self-reorganizing capability and self-reconfiguration.

Users are seeking for more complex and advanced functionalities able to satisfy their increasing requirements. As a consequence, in ubiquitous environments, a different way to design services has to be introduced in order to guarantee services always up to date in a transparent and efficient way. In this paper, we present and analyze a framework for distributed cooperative service evolution in a wireless nomadic environment. In particular, we assume a disconnected network architecture, where users' mobility is exploited to achieve a scalable behavior, and communication is based on localized peer-to-peer interactions among neighboring nodes. Service management is achieved by introducing autonomic services, whose operations are based on a distributed evolution process, which draws tools and concepts from evolutionary computation (and genetic algorithms in particular). The latter relies on the concept ofrecombination, i.e., the exchange of information among service users, which collaborate to enhance theirfitness, defined as the ability of the actual service to fulfill user's requirements. We introduce a general framework for analyzing service recombination policies and exploit results from martingales theory to study their convergence properties.", "authors": [{"name": "david tacconi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81372590830"}, {"name": "daniele miorandi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81327490328"}, {"name": "iacopo carreras", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81340488072"}, {"name": "francesco de pellegrini", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81318493345"}, {"name": "imrich chlamtac", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100299315"}], "title": "Cooperative evolution of services in ubiquitous computing environments", "citations": [{"Name": "Danny Weyns ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "M.

A key concern in DRE systems is determining the spatial deployment topology, which is how the software components map to the underlying hardware components. Optimizations, such as placing software components with high-frequency communications on processors that are closer together, can yield a number of important benefits, such as reduced power consumption due to decreased wireless transmission power required to communicate between the processing nodes.Determining a spatial deployment plan across a series of processors that will minimize power consumption is hard since the spatial deployment plan must respect a combination of real-time scheduling, fault-tolerance, resource, and other complex constraints. This article presents a hybrid heuristic/evolutionary algorithm, called ScatterD, for automatically generating spatial deployment plans that minimize power consumption. This work provides the following contributions to the study of spatial deployment optimization for power consumption minimization: (1) it combines heuristic bin-packing with an evolutionary algorithm to produce a hybrid algorithm with excellent deployment derivation capabilities and scalability, (2) it shows how a unique representation of the spatial deployment solution space integrates the heuristic and evolutionary algorithms, and (3) it analyzes the results of experiments performed with data derived from a large-scale avionics system that compares ScatterD with other automated deployment techniques. These results show that ScatterD reduces power consumption by between 6&percnt; and 240&percnt; more than standard bin-packing, genetic, and particle swarm optimization algorithms.", "authors": [{"name": "jules white", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339536022"}, {"name": "brian dougherty", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435607628"}, {"name": "chris thompson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453642711"}, {"name": "douglas c schmidt", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339526336"}], "title": "ScatterD: Spatial deployment optimization with hybrid heuristic/evolutionary algorithms", "citations": [{"Name": "Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda-Gal\u00e1n ", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Liliana Pasquale ", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Pablo Trinidad ", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Antonio Ruiz-Cort\u00e9s", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "13\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "213\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "virginia tech blacksburg va", "city": null, "Name": "jules white"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "vanderbilt university nashville tn", "city": "nashville", "Name": "brian dougherty"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "vanderbilt university nashville tn", "city": "nashville", "Name": "chris thompson"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "vanderbilt university nashville tn", "city": "nashville", "Name": "douglas c schmidt"}]}, "Article No.: 17": {"references": ["Gul Agha, Actors: a model of concurrent computation in distributed systems, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1986\n", "Guy E.

Call prediction can be useful to many applications such as planning daily schedules, avoiding unwanted communications (e.g. voice spam), and resource planning in call centers. Predicting calls is a very challenging task. We believe that this is an emerging area of research in ambient intelligence where the electronic devices are sensitive and responsive to people's needs and behavior. In particular, we believe that the results of this research will lead to higher productivity and quality of life. In this article, we present a Call Predictor (CP) that offers two new advanced features for the next-generation phones namely \u201cIncoming Call Forecast\u201d and \u201cIntelligent Address Book.\u201d For the Incoming Call Forecast, the CP makes the next-24-hour incoming call prediction based on recent caller's behavior and reciprocity. For the Intelligent Address Book, the CP generates a list of most likely contacts/numbers to be dialed at any given time based on the user's behavior and reciprocity. The CP consists of two major components: Probability Estimator (PE) and Trend Detector (TD). The PE computes the probability of receiving/initiating a call based on the caller/user's calling behavior and reciprocity. We show that the recent trend of the caller/user's calling pattern has higher correlation to the future pattern than the pattern derived from the entire historical data. The TD detects the recent trend of the caller/user's calling pattern and computes the adequacy of historical data in terms of reversed time (time that runs towards the past) based on a trace distance. The recent behavior detection mechanism allows CP to adapt its computation in response to the new calling behaviors. Therefore, CP is adaptive to the recent behavior. For our analysis, we use the real-life call logs of 94 mobile phone users over nine months, which were collected by the Reality Mining Project group at MIT. The performance of the CP is validated for two months based on seven months of training data. The experimental results show that the CP performs reasonably well as an incoming call predictor (Incoming Call Forecast) with false positive rate of 8&percnt;, false negative rate of 1&percnt;, and error rate of 9&percnt;, and as an outgoing call predictor (Intelligent Address Book) with the accuracy of 70&percnt; when the list has five entries. The functionality of the CP can be useful in assisting its user in carrying out everyday life activities such as scheduling daily plans by using the Incoming Call Forecast, and saving time from searching for the phone number in a typically lengthy contact book by using the Intelligent Address Book. Furthermore, we describe other useful applications of CP besides its own aforementioned features including Call Firewall and Call Reminder.", "authors": [{"name": "santi phithakkitnukoon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81388594465"}, {"name": "ram dantu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81326488587"}, {"name": "rob claxton", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81488667425"}, {"name": "nathan eagle", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100250016"}], "title": "Behavior-based adaptive call predictor", "citations": [{"Name": "Leye Wang ", "Country": "switzerland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daqing Zhang ", "Country": "switzerland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Haoyi Xiong", "Country": "switzerland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Haoyi Xiong ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daqing Zhang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Leye Wang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "J.

A locally distributed predicate (LDP) is a novel construction for representing and detecting distributed properties in sparse-topology systems. Our previous work on LDPs presented empirical validation; here we show a formal model for two variants of the LDP algorithm, LDP-Basic and LDP-Snapshot, and establish performance bounds for these variants. We prove that LDP-Basic can detect strong stable predicates, that LDP-Snapshot can detect all stable predicates, and discuss their applicability to various distributed programming domains and to spatial computing in general. LDP detection in bounded-degree networks is shown to be scale-free, making the approach particularly attractive for specific topologies, even though LDPs are less efficient than snapshot algorithms in general distributed systems.", "authors": [{"name": "michael de rosa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100029360"}, {"name": "seth copen goldstein", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100321807"}, {"name": "peter lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100384353"}, {"name": "jason campbell", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100212144"}, {"name": "padmanabhan s pillai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100441627"}], "title": "Detecting Locally Distributed Predicates", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "16\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "173\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university", "city": null, "Name": "michael de rosa"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university", "city": null, "Name": "seth copen goldstein"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university", "city": null, "Name": "peter lee"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "intel labs pittsburgh", "city": null, "Name": "jason campbell"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "intel labs pittsburgh", "city": null, "Name": "padmanabhan s pillai"}]}, "Article No.: 11": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/1968513.1968514", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "jacob beal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314487774"}, {"name": "olivier michel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100481426"}, {"name": "ulrik pagh schultz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100622792"}], "title": "Spatial Computing: Distributed Systems That Take Advantage of Our Geometric World", "citations": [{"Name": "Lance R.

In reactive approaches, adaptations are chosen and executed after some issue in the system has been detected (e.g., unforeseen attacks or failures). In proactive approaches, predictions are used to prepare the system for some future event (e.g., traffic spikes during holidays). In both cases, the choice of adaptation is based on the estimated impact it will have on the system. Current decision-making approaches assume that the impact will be instantaneous, whereas it is common that adaptations take time to produce their impact. Ignoring this latency is problematic because adaptations may not achieve their effect in time for a predicted event. Furthermore, lower impact but quicker adaptations may be ignored altogether, even if over time the accrued impact is actually higher. In this article, we introduce a novel approach to choosing adaptations that considers these latencies. To show how this improves adaptation decisions, we use a two-pronged approach: (i) model checking of Stochastic Multiplayer Games (SMGs) enables us to understand best- and worst-case scenarios of optimal latency-aware and non-latency-aware adaptation without the need to develop specific adaptation algorithms. However, since SMGs do not provide an algorithm to make choices at runtime, we propose a (ii) latency-aware adaptation algorithm to make decisions at runtime. Simulations are used to explore more detailed adaptation behavior and to check if the performance of the algorithm falls within the bounds predicted by SMGs. Our results show that latency awareness improves adaptation outcomes and also allows a larger set of adaptations to be exploited.", "authors": [{"name": "javier camara", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332492029"}, {"name": "gabriel a moreno", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100020743"}, {"name": "david garlan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452615764"}, {"name": "bradley schmerl", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100619354"}], "title": "Analyzing Latency-Aware Self-Adaptation Using Stochastic Games and Simulations", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "48\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "19\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "48\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa", "city": "pittsburgh", "Name": "javier camara"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa", "city": "pittsburgh", "Name": "gabriel a moreno"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa", "city": "pittsburgh", "Name": "david garlan"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa", "city": "pittsburgh", "Name": "bradley schmerl"}]}, "Article No.: 30": {"references": ["Amazon 2009.

These resources are elastically scalable and dynamically provisioned. Furthermore, cloud providers have also pioneered new pricing models like spot instances that are cost-effective. As a result, scientific workflows are increasingly adopting cloud computing. However, spot instances are terminated when the market price exceeds the users bid price. Likewise, cloud is not a utopian environment. Failures are inevitable in such large complex distributed systems. It is also well studied that cloud resources experience fluctuations in the delivered performance. These challenges make fault tolerance an important criterion in workflow scheduling. This article presents an adaptive, just-in-time scheduling algorithm for scientific workflows. This algorithm judiciously uses both spot and on-demand instances to reduce cost and provide fault tolerance. The proposed scheduling algorithm also consolidates resources to further minimize execution time and cost. Extensive simulations show that the proposed heuristics are fault tolerant and are effective, especially under short deadlines, providing robust schedules with minimal makespan and cost.", "authors": [{"name": "deepak poola", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=89758852857"}, {"name": "kotagiri ramamohanarao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100532239"}, {"name": "rajkumar buyya", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100342317"}], "title": "Enhancing Reliability of Workflow Execution Using Task Replication and Spot Instances", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "56\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "21\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "56\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "australia", "university": "university of melbourne", "affiliation_string": "the university of melbourne vic australia", "city": "melbourne", "Name": "deepak poola"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "university of melbourne", "affiliation_string": "the university of melbourne vic australia", "city": "melbourne", "Name": "kotagiri ramamohanarao"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "university of melbourne", "affiliation_string": "the university of melbourne vic australia", "city": "melbourne", "Name": "rajkumar buyya"}]}, "Article No.: 26": {"references": ["Amazon Web Services. 2015.

Traditional software adaptation techniques and recent \u201cmodels&commat;runtime\u201d approaches usually require ana priorimodel for a system\u2019s dynamic behavior. Oftentimes the model is difficult to define and labor-intensive to maintain, and tends to get out of date due to adaptation and architecture decay. We propose an alternative approach that does not require defining the system\u2019s behavior model beforehand, but instead involves mining software component interactions from system execution traces to build a probabilistic usage model, which is in turn used to analyze, plan, and execute adaptations. In this article, we demonstrate how such an approach can be realized and effectively used to address a variety of adaptation concerns. In particular, we describe the details of one application of this approach for safely applying dynamic changes to a running software system without creating inconsistencies. We also provide an overview of two other applications of the approach, identifying potentially malicious (abnormal) behavior for self-protection, and improving deployment of software components in a distributed setting for performance self-optimization. Finally, we report on our experiments with engineering self-management features in an emergency deployment system using the proposed mining approach.", "authors": [{"name": "naeem esfahani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436602167"}, {"name": "eric yuan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100116433"}, {"name": "kyle r canavera", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548618556"}, {"name": "sam malek", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100267865"}], "title": "Inferring Software Component Interaction Dependencies for Adaptation Support", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "39\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "18\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "39\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "google inc mountain view ca", "city": null, "Name": "naeem esfahani"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "george mason university fairfax va", "city": null, "Name": "eric yuan"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "george mason university fairfax va", "city": null, "Name": "kyle r canavera"}, {"country": "Trinidad and Tobago", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california irvine california", "city": "california", "Name": "sam malek"}]}, "Article No.: 27": {"references": ["Cesare Alippi, Intelligence for Embedded Systems: A Methodological Approach, Springer Publishing Company, Incorporated, 2014\n", "Cesare Alippi, Giacomo Boracchi, and Manuel Roveri. 2011.

Existing research suggests that fast gossiping algorithms, based on the properties of order statistics applied to families of exponential random variables, are a viable solution for computing functions of the values stored in the network. We focus on the specific case in which network changes and failures occur in batches with a minimum frequency in the order of the diameter of the network. Our contribution consists in two self-stabilizing mechanisms, allowing fast gossiping algorithms to be applicable to dynamic networks with minor increase in resources usage. The resulting algorithms can be deployed in networks exhibiting churn, node stop-failures and resets, and random topological changes. The theoretical results are verified with simulations on synthetic data, showcasing desirable properties for large-scale network designers such as scalability, lack of single points of failure, and anonymity.", "authors": [{"name": "stefan dulman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350597334"}, {"name": "eric pauwels", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100495017"}], "title": "Self-Stabilized Fast Gossiping Algorithms", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "115\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "13\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "115\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "eric pauwels", "city": null, "Name": "stefan dulman"}]}, "Article No.: 24": {"references": ["Raian Ali, Carlos Solis, Inah Omoronyia, Mazeiar Salehie, and Bashar Nuseibeh. 2012.

It allows different users to share computing and virtual resources transparently, meanwhile guaranteeing substantial cost savings. Due to the tradeoff between scalability and customization, one of the major drawbacks of multi-tenancy is limited configurability. Since users may often have conflicting configuration preferences, offering the best user experience is an open challenge for service providers. In addition, the users, their preferences, and the operational environment may change during the service operation, thus jeopardizing the satisfaction of user preferences. In this article, we present an approach to support user-centric adaptation of multi-tenant services. We describe how to engineer the activities of the Monitoring, Analysis, Planning, Execution (MAPE) loop to support user-centric adaptation, and we focus on adaptation analysis. Our analysis computes a service configuration that optimizes user satisfaction, complies with infrastructural constraints, and minimizes reconfiguration obtrusiveness when user- or service-related changes take place. To support our analysis, we model multi-tenant services and user preferences by using feature and preference models, respectively. We illustrate our approach by utilizing different cases of virtual desktops. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the analysis in improving user preferences satisfaction in negligible time.", "authors": [{"name": "jesus garcia-galan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81481650073"}, {"name": "liliana pasquale", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81338490570"}, {"name": "pablo trinidad", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367593220"}, {"name": "antonio ruiz-cortes", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100078623"}], "title": "User-Centric Adaptation Analysis of Multi-Tenant Services", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "59\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "17\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "59\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of seville", "city": null, "Name": "jesus garcia-galan"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "pablo trinidad", "city": null, "Name": "liliana pasquale"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "liliana pasquale", "city": null, "Name": "university of seville"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "liliana pasquale", "city": null, "Name": "university of seville"}]}, "Article No.: 28": {"references": ["A.

Due to the occurrence of such behavior, there may be temporary loss of connectivity between among the nodes. Such a phenomenon is different from the commonly known node isolation problem in stationary WSNs. The mere activation of intermediate sleep nodes cannot guarantee reestablishment of connectivity, because there may not exist neighbor nodes of the isolated nodes. On the contrary, the increase in communication range of a single sensor node may make it die quickly. Including this, a sensor node has maximum limit of increase in communication range that may not be sufficient to reestablish connectivity. Therefore, considering all these factors for self-organization of the network and isolated node re-connection, we propose a price-based scheme, which addresses the issue by activating intermediate sleep nodes or by adjusting the communication range of some of the other nodes in the network. The scheme also deactivates the additional activated nodes and reduces the increased communication range when the dumb nodes resume their normal behavior, upon the return of favorable environmental conditions. To implement the proposed scheme,CoRADit is required to construct the network using GPS-enabled adjustable communication range sensor nodes. Through simulation we compare our proposed scheme with the existing topology management schemes -- LETC and A1 -- in the same scenario by considering the number of activated nodes, message overhead, and energy consumption. We find that the proposed scheme shows improved performance compared to the existing topology management schemes.", "authors": [{"name": "pushpendu kar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=88158842157"}, {"name": "arijit roy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=88159307057"}, {"name": "sudip misra", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330495517"}], "title": "Connectivity Reestablishment in Self-Organizing Sensor Networks with Dumb Nodes", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "55\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "14\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "55\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "india", "university": "indian institute of technology kharagpur", "affiliation_string": "indian institute of technology kharagpur west bengal india", "city": "kharagpur", "Name": "pushpendu kar"}, {"country": "india", "university": "indian institute of technology kharagpur", "affiliation_string": "indian institute of technology kharagpur west bengal india", "city": "kharagpur", "Name": "arijit roy"}, {"country": "india", "university": "indian institute of technology kharagpur", "affiliation_string": "indian institute of technology kharagpur west bengal india", "city": "kharagpur", "Name": "sudip misra"}]}}, "date": {"month": "February", "year": "2016"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Sherief Abdallah , Victor Lesser, Multiagent reinforcement learning and self-organization in a network of agents, Proceedings of the 6th international joint conference on Autonomous agents and multiagent systems, May 14-18, 2007, Honolulu, Hawaii[doi>10.1145/1329125.1329172]\n", "Samir Aknine , Suzanne Pinson , Melvin F.

Each network link type has a bias for communicating different types of resources; thus, the task\u2019s access to the required resources in multiplex networks is strongly related to the network link types. However, traditional task allocation and load balancing methods only considered the situations of agents themselves and did not address the effects of network link types in multiplex networks. To solve this problem, this article considers both link types and agents, and substantially extends the existing work by highlighting the effect of network layers on task allocation and load balancing. Two multiplex network-adapted models of task allocation with load balancing are presented: network layer-oriented allocation and agent-oriented allocation. This article also addresses the unreliability in multiplex networks, which includes the unreliable links and agents, and implements a reliable task allocation based on a negotiation reputation and reward mechanism. Our findings show that both of our presented models can effectively and robustly satisfy the task allocation objectives in unreliable multiplex networks; the experiments prove that they can significantly reduce the time costs and improve the success rate of tasks for multiplex networks over the traditional simplex network-adapted task allocation model. Lastly, we find that our presented network layer-oriented allocation performs much better in terms of reliability and allocation time compared to our presented agent-oriented allocation, which further explains the importance of network layers in multiplex networks.", "authors": [{"name": "yichuan jiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87059554357"}, {"name": "yifeng zhou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82259192457"}, {"name": "yunpeng li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87059467457"}], "title": "Reliable Task Allocation with Load Balancing in Multiplex Networks", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "89\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "16\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "103\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "china", "university": "southeast university", "affiliation_string": "southeast university nanjing china", "city": "nanjing", "Name": "yichuan jiang"}, {"country": "china", "university": "southeast university", "affiliation_string": "southeast university nanjing china", "city": "nanjing", "Name": "yifeng zhou"}, {"country": "china", "university": "southeast university", "affiliation_string": "southeast university nanjing china", "city": "nanjing", "Name": "yunpeng li"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Agnar Aamodt and Enric Plaza. 1994.

This calls for suitable models and infrastructures promoting spontaneous, situated, and self-adaptive interactions between components. SAPERE (Self-Aware Pervasive Service Ecosystems) is a general coordination framework aimed at facilitating the decentralized and situated execution of self-organizing and self-adaptive pervasive computing services. SAPERE adopts a nature-inspired approach, in which pervasive services are modeled and deployed as autonomous individuals in an ecosystem of other services and devices, all of which interact in accord to a limited set of coordination laws, or eco-laws. In this article, we present the overall rationale underlying SAPERE and its reference architecture. We introduce the eco-laws--based coordination model and show how it can be used to express and easily enforce general-purpose self-organizing coordination patterns. The middleware infrastructure supporting the SAPERE model is presented and evaluated, and the overall advantages of SAPERE are discussed in the context of exemplary use cases.", "authors": [{"name": "gabriella castelli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331489727"}, {"name": "marco mamei", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100451227"}, {"name": "alberto rosi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331503151"}, {"name": "franco zambonelli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100268981"}], "title": "Engineering Pervasive Service Ecosystems: The SAPERE Approach", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "116\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "157\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universita di modena e reggio emilia reggio emilia italy", "city": "modena", "Name": "gabriella castelli"}, {"country": "Italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universita di modena e reggio emilia reggio emilia italy", "city": "modena", "Name": "marco mamei"}, {"country": "Italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universita di modena e reggio emilia reggio emilia italy", "city": "modena", "Name": "alberto rosi"}, {"country": "Italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universita di modena e reggio emilia reggio emilia italy", "city": "modena", "Name": "franco zambonelli"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Enda Barrett , Jim Duggan , Enda Howley, A parallel framework for Bayesian reinforcement learning, Connection Science, v.26 n.1, p.7-23, March 2014[doi>10.1080/09540091.2014.885268]\n", "Dominique Barth and Loubna Echabbi. 2008.

Current technology allows Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to renegotiate contracts online to maximize profits. Changing link prices will influence interdomain routing policies that are now driven by monetary aspects as well as global resource and performance optimization. In this article, we consider an interdomain routing game in which the ISP\u2019s action is to set the price for its transit links. Assuming a cheapest path routing scheme, the optimal action is the price setting that yields the highest utility (i.e., profit) and depends both on the network load and the actions of other ISPs. We adapt a continuous and a discrete action learning automaton (LA) to operate in this framework as a tool that can be used by ISP operators to learn optimal price setting. In our model, agents representing different ISPs learn only on the basis of local information and do not need any central coordination or sensitive information exchange. Simulation results show that a single ISP employing LAs is able to learn the optimal price in a stationary environment. By introducing a selective exploration rule, LAs are also able to operate in nonstationary environments. When two ISPs employ LAs, we show that they converge to stable and fair equilibrium strategies.", "authors": [{"name": "peter vrancx", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384596090"}, {"name": "pasquale gurzi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81421603033"}, {"name": "abdel rodriguez", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81388592564"}, {"name": "kris steenhaut", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100244192"}, {"name": "ann nowe", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100529525"}], "title": "A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Interdomain Routing with Link Prices", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "70\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "90\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "belgium", "university": "vrije universiteit brussel", "affiliation_string": "vrije universiteit brussel brussels belgium", "city": "brussels", "Name": "peter vrancx"}, {"country": "belgium", "university": "vrije universiteit brussel", "affiliation_string": "vrije universiteit brussel brussels belgium", "city": "brussels", "Name": "pasquale gurzi"}, {"country": "costa rica", "university": "universidad central", "affiliation_string": "vrije universiteit brussel and universidad central marta abreu de las villas brussels belgium", "city": "san jose", "Name": "abdel rodriguez"}, {"country": "belgium", "university": "vrije universiteit brussel", "affiliation_string": "vrije universiteit brussel brussels belgium", "city": "brussels", "Name": "kris steenhaut"}, {"country": "belgium", "university": "vrije universiteit brussel", "affiliation_string": "vrije universiteit brussel", "city": "brussels", "Name": "ann nowe"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Bernardetta Addis , Danilo Ardagna , Barbara Panicucci , Mark Squillante , Li Zhang, A Hierarchical Approach for the Resource Management of Very Large Cloud Platforms, IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, v.10 n.5, p.253-272, September 2013[doi>10.1109/TDSC.2013.4]\n", "Yuehui Chen , Bo Yang , A.

In this article, we propose and develop a self-tuning request batching mechanism to simultaneously achieve the two correlated goals. The batching mechanism increases the cache hit rate at the front-tier Web server, which provides the opportunity to improve an application\u2019s performance and the energy efficiency of the server system. The core of the batching mechanism is a novel and practical two-layer control system that adaptively adjusts the batching interval and frequency states of CPUs according to the service level agreement and the workload characteristics. The batching control adopts a self-tuning fuzzy model predictive control approach for application performance improvement. The power control dynamically adjusts the frequency of Central Processing Units (CPUs) with Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) in response to workload fluctuations for energy efficiency. A coordinator between the two control loops achieves the desired performance and energy efficiency. We further extend the self-tuning batching with DVFS approach from a single-server system to a multiserver system. It relies on a MIMO expert fuzzy control to adjust the CPU frequencies of multiple servers and coordinate the frequency states of CPUs at different tiers. We implement the mechanism in a test bed. Experimental results demonstrate that the new approach significantly improves the application performance in terms of the system throughput and average response time. At the same time, the results also illustrate the mechanism can reduce the energy consumption of a single-server system by 13&percnt; and a multiserver system by 11&percnt;, respectively.", "authors": [{"name": "dazhao cheng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84459472957"}, {"name": "yanfei guo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658646468"}, {"name": "changjun jiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81333489401"}, {"name": "xiaobo zhou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384607560"}], "title": "Self-Tuning Batching with DVFS for Performance Improvement and Energy Efficiency in Internet Servers", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "79\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "79\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "South Africa", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado colorado springs austin co", "city": "springs", "Name": "dazhao cheng"}, {"country": "South Africa", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado colorado springs austin co", "city": "springs", "Name": "yanfei guo"}, {"country": "china", "university": "tongji university", "affiliation_string": "tongji university shanghai china", "city": "shanghai", "Name": "changjun jiang"}, {"country": "South Africa", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado colorado springs austin co", "city": "springs", "Name": "xiaobo zhou"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Aberdeen Group. 2010.

Autonomic computing is presented as the alternative to cope with the growing complexity. It is a holistic approach, in which the systems are able to configure, heal, optimize, and protect by themselves. Web-based applications are an example of systems where the complexity is high. The number of components, their interoperability, and workload variations are factors that may lead to performance failures or unavailability scenarios. The occurrence of these scenarios affects the revenue and reputation of businesses that rely on these types of applications.In this article, we present a self-healing framework for Web-based applications (SH\u00f5WA).SH\u00f5WA is composed by several modules, which monitor the application, analyze the data to detect and pinpoint anomalies, and execute recovery actions autonomously. The monitoring is done by a small aspect-oriented programming agent. This agent does not require changes to the application source code and includes adaptive and selective algorithms to regulate the level of monitoring. The anomalies are detected and pinpointed by means of statistical correlation. The data analysis detects changes in the server response time and analyzes if those changes are correlated with the workload or are due to a performance anomaly. In the presence of performance anomalies, the data analysis pinpoints the anomaly. Upon the pinpointing of anomalies,SH\u00f5WA executes a recovery procedure. We also present a study about the detection and localization of anomalies, the accuracy of the data analysis, and the performance impact induced bySH\u00f5WA. Two benchmarking applications, exercised through dynamic workloads, and different types of anomaly were considered in the study. The results reveal that (1) the capacity ofSH\u00f5WA to detect and pinpoint anomalies while the number of end users affected is low; (2)SH\u00f5WA was able to detect anomalies without raising any false alarm; and (3)SH\u00f5WA does not induce a significant performance overhead (throughput was affected in less than 1&percnt;, and the response time delay was no more than 2 milliseconds).", "authors": [{"name": "joao paulo magalhaes", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474684232"}, {"name": "luis moura silva", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100060394"}], "title": "SH\u00f5WA: A Self-Healing Framework for Web-Based Applications", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "99\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "136\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ciicesi estgf-polytechnic institute of porto", "city": null, "Name": "joao paulo magalhaes"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cisuc university of coimbra", "city": null, "Name": "luis moura silva"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 19": {"references": ["Marcos K.

Watts-Strogatz and Waxman graphs are used as underlying network topologies. A consensus algorithm is proposed that exchanges state information with dynamically randomly selected neighbors and, through this randomization, achieves almost sure convergence in some scenarios.", "authors": [{"name": "alexander gogolev", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502812294"}, {"name": "nikolaj marchenko", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81464651543"}, {"name": "lucio marcenaro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100603829"}, {"name": "christian bettstetter", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100343443"}], "title": "Distributed Binary Consensus in Networks with Disturbances", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "94\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "94\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of klagenfurt", "city": null, "Name": "alexander gogolev"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of klagenfurt", "city": null, "Name": "nikolaj marchenko"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of genoa", "affiliation_string": "university of genoa genoa italy", "city": "genoa", "Name": "lucio marcenaro"}, {"country": "Austria", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of klagenfurt lakeside labs gmbh", "city": "klagenfurt", "Name": "christian bettstetter"}]}, "Article No.: 15": {"references": ["L.

Accordingly, this paper considers fault monitoring as a latent factors discovery problem. In the context of end-to-end probing, the goal is to devise an efficient sampling policy that makes the best use of a constrained sampling budget.Previous work addresses fault monitoring in a collaborative prediction framework, where the information is a snapshot of the probes outcomes. Here, we take into account the fact that the system dynamically evolves at various time scales. We propose and evaluate Sequential Matrix Factorization (SMF) that exploits both the recent advances in matrix factorization for the instantaneous information and a new sampling heuristics based on historical information. The effectiveness of the SMF approach is exemplified on datasets of increasing difficulty and compared with state of the art history-based or snapshot-based methods. In all cases, strong adaptivity under the specific flavor of active learning is required to unleash the full potential of coupling the most confident and the most uncertain sampling heuristics, which is the cornerstone of SMF.", "authors": [{"name": "dawei feng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83358686657"}, {"name": "cecile germain", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319492066"}], "title": "Fault Monitoring with Sequential Matrix Factorization", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "48\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "48\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "philippines", "university": "national university", "affiliation_string": "national university of defense technology universite paris sud inria and cnrs changsha china", "city": "manila", "Name": "dawei feng"}, {"country": "France", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universite paris sud inria and cnrs orsay cedex", "city": "paris", "Name": "cecile germain"}]}, "Article No.: 18": {"references": ["A.

Simulating a wide range of events and conditions provides a more nuanced model, but also increases its computational footprint. To manage these processing requirements in a scalable manner, discrete event simulations can be distributed across multiple computing resources. Orchestrating the simulations in a distributed setting involves coping withresource uncertainty.We consider three key aspects of resource uncertainty: resource failures, heterogeneity, and slowdowns. Each of these aspects is managed autonomously, which involves making accurate predictions of future execution times and latencies while also accounting for differences in hardware capabilities and dynamic resource consumption profiles. Further complicating matters, individual tasks within the simulation are stateful and stochastic, requiring inter-task communication and synchronization to produce accurate outcomes. We deal with these challenges through intelligent state collection and migration, active resource monitoring, and empirical evaluation of resource capabilities under changing conditions. To underscore the viability of our solution, we provide benchmarks using a production discrete event simulation that can simultaneously sustain failures, manage resource heterogeneity, and handle slowdowns while being orchestrated by our framework.", "authors": [{"name": "zhiquan sui", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82658670257"}, {"name": "matthew malensek", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81496687661"}, {"name": "neil harvey", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314482836"}, {"name": "shrideep pallickara", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350589354"}], "title": "Autonomous Orchestration of Distributed Discrete Event Simulations in the Presence of Resource Uncertainty", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "65\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "65\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "colorado state university co usa", "city": null, "Name": "zhiquan sui"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "colorado state university co usa", "city": null, "Name": "matthew malensek"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of guelph", "affiliation_string": "university of guelph ontario canada", "city": "guelph", "Name": "neil harvey"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "colorado state university co usa", "city": null, "Name": "shrideep pallickara"}]}, "Article No.: 16": {"references": ["Miron Abramovici , Charles E.

Managing the consequent growing complexity, including fault tolerance issues in deep submicron technologies, is a hard challenge for hardware designers. Self-organization may represent a viable path toward the development of massively parallel architectures in current and future technologies. This approach is progressively more studied in multiprocessor architectures where, however, a further mind-set shift in terms of programming paradigm is required.In this article, self-organization and self-adaptiveness are exploited for the design of a coprocessing unit for array computations, supporting floating-point arithmetic. From the experience of previous explorations, an architecture embodying some principle of swarm intelligence to pursue adaptability, scalability, and fault tolerance is proposed. The architecture realizes a loosely structured collection of hardware agents implementing fixed behavioral rules aimed at the best exploitation of the available resources in whatever kind of context without any hardware reconfiguration. Comparisons with off-the-shelf very long instruction word (VLIW) digital signal processors (DSPs) on specific tasks reveal similar performance thus not paying the improved robustness with performance. The multitasking capabilities, together with the intrinsic scalability, make this approach valuable for future extensions as well, especially in the field of neuronal networks simulators.", "authors": [{"name": "danilo pani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309496284"}, {"name": "carlo sau", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658711018"}, {"name": "francesca palumbo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384598922"}, {"name": "luigi raffo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100047518"}], "title": "Computing Swarms for Self-Adaptiveness and Self-Organization in Floating-Point Array Processing", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "133\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "17\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "133\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "italy", "university": "university of cagliari", "affiliation_string": "university of cagliari cagliari italy", "city": "cagliari", "Name": "danilo pani"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of cagliari", "affiliation_string": "university of cagliari cagliari italy", "city": "cagliari", "Name": "carlo sau"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of sassari", "affiliation_string": "university of sassari sassari italy", "city": "sassari", "Name": "francesca palumbo"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of cagliari", "affiliation_string": "university of cagliari cagliari italy", "city": "cagliari", "Name": "luigi raffo"}]}, "Article No.: 17": {"references": ["Claus Bahlmann , Bernard Haasdonk , Hans Burkhardt, On-Line Handwriting Recognition with Support Vector Machines \" A Kernel Approach, Proceedings of the Eighth International Workshop on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition (IWFHR'02), p.49, August 06-08, 2002\n", "William Joseph Butera , V.

We describe three distributed gesture-recognition algorithms that are designed to function on sensor arrays with minimal computational power, limited memory, limited bandwidth, and possibly unreliable communication. These constraints cause storage of gesture templates within the system and distributed consensus algorithms for recognizing gestures to be difficult. Building up on a chain vector encoding algorithm commonly used for gesture recognition on a central computer, we approach this problem by dividing the gesture dataset between nodes such that each node has access to the complete dataset via its neighbors. Nodes share gesture information among each other, then each node tries to identify the gesture. In order to distribute the computational load among all nodes, we also investigate an alternative algorithm, in which each node that detects a motion will apply a recognition algorithm to part of the input gesture, then share its data with all other motion nodes. Next, we show that a hybrid algorithm that distributes both computation and template storage can address trade-offs between memory and computational efficiency.", "authors": [{"name": "homa hosseinmardi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81556528856"}, {"name": "akshay mysore", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658749256"}, {"name": "nicholas farrow", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81555941156"}, {"name": "nikolaus correll", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384599860"}, {"name": "richard han", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100050942"}], "title": "Distributed Spatiotemporal Gesture Recognition in Sensor Arrays", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "58\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "58\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado boulder boulder co", "city": null, "Name": "homa hosseinmardi"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado boulder boulder co", "city": null, "Name": "akshay mysore"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado boulder boulder co", "city": null, "Name": "nicholas farrow"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado boulder boulder co", "city": null, "Name": "nikolaus correll"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado boulder boulder co", "city": null, "Name": "richard han"}]}, "Article No.: 21": {"references": ["F.

We compare homogeneous configurations, when cameras use the same strategy, with heterogeneous configurations, when cameras use different strategies. Our first contribution is to establish that static heterogeneity leads to new outcomes that are more efficient than those possible with homogeneity. Next, two forms of dynamic heterogeneity are investigated: nonadaptive mixed strategies and adaptive strategies, which learn online. Our second contribution is to show that mixed strategies offer Pareto efficiency consistently comparable with the most efficient static heterogeneous configurations. Since the particular configuration required for high Pareto efficiency in a scenario will not be known in advance, our third contribution is to show how decentralized online learning can lead to more efficient outcomes than the homogeneous case. In some cases, outcomes from online learning were more efficient than all other evaluated configuration types. Our fourth contribution is to show that online learning typically leads to outcomes more evenly spread over the objective space. Our results provide insight into the relationship between static, dynamic, and adaptive heterogeneity, suggesting that all have a key role in achieving efficient self-organization.", "authors": [{"name": "peter r lewis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384609736"}, {"name": "lukas esterle", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490691708"}, {"name": "arjun chandra", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81557076456"}, {"name": "bernhard rinner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100473390"}, {"name": "jim torresen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100336589"}, {"name": "xin yao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100542438"}], "title": "Static, Dynamic, and Adaptive Heterogeneity in Distributed Smart Camera Networks", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "101\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "101\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "aston university", "affiliation_string": "aston university birmingham uk", "city": "birmingham", "Name": "peter r lewis"}, {"country": "austria", "university": "universitat klagenfurt", "affiliation_string": "alpen-adria-universitat klagenfurt and lakeside labs klagenfurt austria", "city": "klagenfurt", "Name": "lukas esterle"}, {"country": "norway", "university": "university of oslo", "affiliation_string": "university of oslo oslo norway", "city": "oslo", "Name": "arjun chandra"}, {"country": "austria", "university": "universitat klagenfurt", "affiliation_string": "alpen-adria-universitat klagenfurt and lakeside labs klagenfurt austria", "city": "klagenfurt", "Name": "bernhard rinner"}, {"country": "norway", "university": "university of oslo", "affiliation_string": "university of oslo oslo norway", "city": "oslo", "Name": "jim torresen"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of birmingham", "affiliation_string": "university of birmingham birmingham uk", "city": "birmingham", "Name": "xin yao"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["A.

Due to communication and sensing limitations, it is often necessary to execute this task with little or no communication between swarm members. Unfortunately, prior approaches based on repulsive forces or uniform random walks can often converge quite slowly. With an appropriate choice of random distribution, however, it is possible to generate optimal or near-optimal dispersion and mixing in swarms with zero communication. In particular, we discuss three extremely simple algorithms: reactive Levy walk, reactive ball dispersion, and purely reactive dispersion. All three algorithms vastly outperform prior approaches in both constrained and unconstrained environments, providing a range of options for trading off between aggressiveness and evenness in dispersion.", "authors": [{"name": "jacob beal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314487774"}], "title": "Superdiffusive Dispersion and Mixing of Swarms", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "66\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "66\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "raytheon bbn technologies ma usa", "city": null, "Name": "jacob beal"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2746344", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "IEEE SASO (Self-Adapting and Self-Organizing Systems) is the premier international conference for computer systems and networks that autonomously change some aspect of themselves: code, form, function, shape, structure, components, and so on.

These applications include many large-scale distributed problems, including the optimal storage of large sets of graph-structured data over several hosts. However, in very large-scale distributed scenarios, state-of-the-art algorithms are not directly applicable because they typically involve frequent global operations over the entire graph. In this article, we propose a fully distributed algorithm called JA-BE-JAthat uses local search and simulated annealing techniques for two types of graph partitioning:edge-cutpartitioning andvertex-cutpartitioning. The algorithm is massively parallel: There is no central coordination, each vertex is processed independently, and only the direct neighbors of a vertex and a small subset of random vertices in the graph need to be known locally. Strict synchronization is not required. These features allow JA-BE-JAto be easily adapted to any distributed graph-processing system from data centers to fully distributed networks. We show that the minimal edge-cut value empirically achieved by JA-BE-JAis comparable to state-of-the-art centralized algorithms such as Metis. In particular, on large social networks, JA-BE-JAoutperforms Metis. We also show that JA-BE-JAcomputes very low vertex-cuts, which are proved significantly more effective than edge-cuts for processing most real-world graphs.", "authors": [{"name": "fatemeh rahimian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81479661421"}, {"name": "amir h payberah", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81479661172"}, {"name": "sarunas girdzijauskas", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100520867"}, {"name": "mark jelasity", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100513586"}, {"name": "seif haridi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100450229"}], "title": "A Distributed Algorithm for Large-Scale Graph Partitioning", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "180\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "43\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "180\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "sweden", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "kth royal institute of technology and sics swedish ict sweden", "city": null, "Name": "fatemeh rahimian"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "sarunas girdzijauskas", "city": null, "Name": "amir h payberah"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "mark jelasity", "city": null, "Name": "kth royal institute of technology sweden"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "seif haridi", "city": null, "Name": "mta szte research group on ai hungarian academy of sciences and university of szeged hungary"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "amir h payberah", "city": null, "Name": "kth royal institute of technology and sics swedish ict sweden"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["S.

However, the emergence of Opportunistic Networking (ON) has opened up crowdsourcing to the spatial domain. In this article, we bring the ON model for potential crowdsourcing in the smart city environment. We introduce cognitive features of the ON that allow users\u2019 mobile devices to become aware of the surrounding physical environment. Specifically, we exploit cognitive psychology studies on dynamic memory structures and cognitive heuristics\u2014mental models that describe how the human brain handles decision making among complex and real-time stimuli. Combined with ON, these cognitive features allow devices to act as proxies in their users\u2019 cyberworlds and exchange knowledge to deliver awareness of places in an urban environment. This is done through tags associated with locations. They represent features that are perceived by humans about a place. We consider the extent to which this knowledge becomes available to participants using interactions with locations and other nodes. This is assessed taking into account a wide range of cognitive parameters. Outcomes are important because this functionality could support a new type of recommendation system that is independent of the traditional forms of networking.", "authors": [{"name": "matteo mordacchini", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81312484091"}, {"name": "andrea passarella", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100196659"}, {"name": "marco conti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100031433"}, {"name": "stuart m allen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100651767"}, {"name": "martin j chorley", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474673162"}, {"name": "gualtiero b colombo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81416605185"}, {"name": "vlad tanasescu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367595686"}, {"name": "roger m whitaker", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100483299"}], "title": "Crowdsourcing through Cognitive Opportunistic Networks", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "165\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "14\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "165\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "istituto di informatica e telematica cnr italy", "city": null, "Name": "matteo mordacchini"}, {"country": "italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "istituto di informatica e telematica cnr italy", "city": null, "Name": "andrea passarella"}, {"country": "italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "istituto di informatica e telematica cnr italy", "city": null, "Name": "marco conti"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "cardiff university", "affiliation_string": "school of computer science  informatics cardiff university uk", "city": "cardiff", "Name": "stuart m allen"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "cardiff university", "affiliation_string": "school of computer science  informatics cardiff university uk", "city": "cardiff", "Name": "martin j chorley"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "cardiff university", "affiliation_string": "school of computer science  informatics cardiff university uk", "city": "cardiff", "Name": "gualtiero b colombo"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "cardiff university", "affiliation_string": "school of computer science  informatics cardiff university uk", "city": "cardiff", "Name": "vlad tanasescu"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "cardiff university", "affiliation_string": "school of computer science  informatics cardiff university uk", "city": "cardiff", "Name": "roger m whitaker"}]}, "Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Gerrit Anders , Christian Hinrichs , Florian Siefert , Pascal Behrmann , Wolfgang Reif , Michael Sonnenschein, On the Influence of Inter-Agent Variation on Multi-Agent Algorithms Solving a Dynamic Task Allocation Problem under Uncertainty, Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE Sixth International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems, p.29-38, September 10-14, 2012[doi>10.1109/SASO.2012.16]\n", "Gerrit Anders, Alexander Schiendorfer, Jan-Philipp Stegh\u00f6fer, and Wolfgang Reif. 2014a.

In open systems, various uncertainties\u2014introduced by the environment as well as the agents\u2019 possibly self-interested or even malicious behavior\u2014have to be taken into account to be able to allocate the resources according to the actual demand.In this article, we present a trust- and cooperation-based algorithm that solves a dynamic resource allocation problem in open systems of systems. To measure and deal with uncertainties imposed by the environment and the agents at runtime, the algorithm uses the social concept of trust. In a hierarchical setting, we additionally show how agents create constraint models by learning the capabilities of subordinate agents if these are not able or willing to disclose this information. Throughout the article, the creation of power plant schedules in decentralized autonomous power management systems serves as a running example.", "authors": [{"name": "gerrit anders", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81486653741"}, {"name": "alexander schiendorfer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658663754"}, {"name": "florian siefert", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81496689653"}, {"name": "jan-philipp steghofer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81438596999"}, {"name": "wolfgang reif", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100564925"}], "title": "Cooperative Resource Allocation in Open Systems of Systems", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "123\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "123\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "institute for software  systems engineering augsburg university germany", "city": "augsburg", "Name": "gerrit anders"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "institute for software  systems engineering augsburg university germany", "city": "augsburg", "Name": "alexander schiendorfer"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "institute for software  systems engineering augsburg university germany", "city": "augsburg", "Name": "florian siefert"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "wolfgang reif", "city": null, "Name": "jan-philipp steghofer"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "alexander schiendorfer", "city": null, "Name": "institute for software  systems engineering augsburg university germany"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["F.

Future grids will integrate a wide variety of heterogeneous producers and consumers that are unpredictable and operate at various scales. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) solutions will have to control these in order to attain global objectives at the macrolevel, while also considering private interests at the microlevel. This article proposes ageneric holonic architecture to help the development of ICT control systemsthat meet these requirements. We show how this architecture can integrate heterogeneous control designs, including state-of-the-art smart grid solutions. To illustrate the applicability and utility of this generic architecture, we exemplify its use via a concrete proof-of-concept implementation for a holonic controller, which integrates two types of control solutions and manages a multiscale, multiobjective grid simulator in several scenarios. We believe that the proposed contribution is essentialfor helping to understand, to reason about, and to develop the \u201csmart\u201d side of future power grids.", "authors": [{"name": "sylvain frey", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474680940"}, {"name": "ada diaconescu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100548357"}, {"name": "david menga", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351596117"}, {"name": "isabelle demeure", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100573937"}], "title": "A Generic Holonic Control Architecture for Heterogeneous Multiscale and Multiobjective Smart Microgrids", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "94\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "94\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "telecom paristech cnrs ltci edf rd", "city": null, "Name": "sylvain frey"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "telecom paristech cnrs ltci", "city": null, "Name": "ada diaconescu"}, {"country": "France", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "edf rd clamart france", "city": "clamart", "Name": "david menga"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "telecom paristech cnrs ltci", "city": null, "Name": "isabelle demeure"}]}}, "date": {"month": "June", "year": "2015"}}}, "Volume5": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Article No.: 16": {"references": ["Michael Becht , Thorsten Gurzki , J\u00fcrgen Klarmann , Matthias Muscholl, ROPE: Role Oriented Programming Environment for Multiagent Systems, Proceedings of the Fourth IECIS International Conference on Cooperative Information Systems, p.325, September 02-04, 1999\n", "Fabio Bellifemine , Agostino Poggi , Giovanni Rimassa, JADE: a FIPA2000 compliant agent development environment, Proceedings of the fifth international conference on Autonomous agents, p.216-217, May 2001, Montreal, Quebec, Canada[doi>10.1145/375735.376120]\n", "Giacomo Cabri , Letizia Leonardi , Franco Zambonelli, Separation of Concerns in Agent Applications by Roles, Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems, p.430-438, July 02-05, 2002\n", "Laurence Cholvy , Christophe Garion , Claire Saurel, Ability in a multi-agent context: a model in the situation calculus, Proceedings of the 6th international conference on Computational Logic in Multi-Agent Systems, June 27-29, 2005, London, UK[doi>10.1007/11750734_2]\n", "CZT. 2008.

Such systems often comprise different components that interact with each other as peers, as such forming a decentralized system. The system components and collaborations change over time, often in unanticipated ways. Multiagent systems belong to a class of decentralized systems that are known for realizing qualities such as adaptability, robustness, and scalability in such environments. A typical way to structure and manage interactions among agents is by means of organizations. Existing approaches usually endow agents with a dual responsibility: on the one hand agents have to play roles providing the associated functionality in the organization, on the other hand agents are responsible for setting up organizations and managing organization dynamics. Engineering realistic multiagent systems in which agents encapsulate this dual responsibility is a complex task.In this article, we present an organization model for context-driven dynamic agent organizations. The model defines abstractions that support application developers to describe dynamic organizations. The organization model is part of an integrated approach, called MACODO: Middleware Architecture for COntext-driven Dynamic agent Organizations. The complementary part of the MACODO approach is a middleware platform that supports the distributed execution of dynamic organizations specified using the abstractions, as described in Weyns et al. [2009].In the model, the life-cycle management of dynamic organizations is separated from the agents: organizations are first-class citizens, and their dynamics are governed by laws. The laws specify how changes in the system (e.g., an agent joins an organization) and changes in the context (e.g., information observed in the environment) lead to dynamic reorganizations. As such, the model makes it easier to understand and specify dynamic organizations in multiagent systems, and promotes reusing the life-cycle management of dynamic organizations. The organization model is formally described to specify the semantics of the abstractions, and ensure its type safety. We apply the organization model to specify dynamic organizations for a traffic monitoring application.", "authors": [{"name": "danny weyns", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100589653"}, {"name": "robrecht haesevoets", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384602543"}, {"name": "alexander helleboogh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350591210"}], "title": "The MACODO organization model for context-driven dynamic agent organizations", "citations": [{"Name": "Zeineb Graja ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Amira Regayeg ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ahmed Hadj Kacem", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Amit K.

Such applications are commonly modeled as graphs with nodes and edges. Usually nodes represent running processes that exchange information with each other through communication channels as represented by the edges. They often need to autonomously determine their suitable working mode or local status for the purpose of improving performance, reducing operation cost, or achieving system-level design goals. In order to achieve this objective, the concept of status configuration is introduced in this article and a mathematical correspondence is further established between status configuration and an optimization index (OI), which serves as a unified abstraction of any system design goals. Guided by this correspondence and inspired by the cross-entropy algorithm, a cross-entropy-driven self-organization mechanism (CESM) is proposed in this article. CESM exhibits the self-organization property since desirable status configurations that lead to highOIvalues will quickly emerge from purely localized interactions. Both theoretical and experimental analysis have been performed. The results strongly indicate that CESM is a simple yet effective technique which is potentially suitable for many P2P-like applications.", "authors": [{"name": "gang chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100110850"}, {"name": "abdolhossein sarrafzadeh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81321497616"}, {"name": "chor ping low", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100143411"}, {"name": "liang zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100121312"}], "title": "A self-organization mechanism based on cross-entropy method for P2P-like applications", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "17\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "336\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "new zealand", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "unitec new zealand", "city": null, "Name": "gang chen"}, {"country": "new zealand", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "unitec new zealand", "city": null, "Name": "abdolhossein sarrafzadeh"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": "nanyang technological university", "affiliation_string": "nanyang technological university singapore", "city": "singapore", "Name": "chor ping low"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": "nanyang technological university", "affiliation_string": "nanyang technological university singapore", "city": "singapore", "Name": "liang zhang"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Alfarez Abdul-Rahman , Stephen Hailes, Supporting Trust in Virtual Communities, Proceedings of the 33rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences-Volume 6, p.6007, January 04-07, 2000\n", "Carbone, M., Nielsen, M., and Sassone, V. 2003.

Key examples include social networks and service-oriented computing. Existing approaches either ignore evidence or only partially address the twin challenges of mapping evidence to trustworthiness and combining trust reports from imperfectly trusted sources. This article develops a mathematically well-formulated approach that naturally supports discounting and combining evidence-based trust reports.This article understands an agent Alice's trust in an agent Bob in terms of Alice's certainty in her belief that Bob is trustworthy. Unlike previous approaches, this article formulates certainty in terms of evidence based on a statistical measure defined over a probability distribution of the probability of positive outcomes. This definition supports important mathematical properties ensuring correct results despite conflicting evidence: (1) for a fixed amount of evidence, certainty increases as conflict in the evidence decreases and (2) for a fixed level of conflict, certainty increases as the amount of evidence increases. Moreover, despite a subtle definition of certainty, this work (3) establishes a bijection between evidence and trust spaces, enabling robust combination of trust reports and (4) provides an efficient algorithm for computing this bijection.", "authors": [{"name": "yonghong wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436595288"}, {"name": "munindar p singh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350589454"}], "title": "Evidence-based trust: A mathematical model geared for multiagent systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Anup K.

One of the vehicles acts as aleader, being remotely driven by the user, the others represent thefollowers. Each vehicle has a low-power wireless sensor node attached, featuring a 3D accelerometer and a magnetic compass. Speed and orientation are computed in real time using inertial navigation techniques. The leader periodically transmits these measures to the followers, which implement a lightweight fuzzy logic controller for imitating the leader's movement pattern.

This helps to explain the onset and persistence of many undesired phenomena, for example, traffic jams. It also reflects the apparent helplessness of drivers in traffic, who feel like passive particles that are pushed around by exterior forces; one of the crucial aspects is the inability to communicate and coordinate with other traffic participants.We present distributed methods for solving these fundamental problems, employing modern wireless, ad-hoc, multi-hop networks. The underlying idea is to use these capabilities as the basis for self-organizing methods for coordinating data collection and processing, recognizing traffic phenomena, and changing their structure by coordinated behavior. The overall objective is a multi-level approach that reaches from protocols for local wireless communication, data dissemination, pattern recognition, over hierarchical structuring and coordinated behavior, all the way to large-scale traffic regulation.In this article, we describe three types of results: (i) self-organizing and distributed methods for maintaining and collecting data (using our concept ofHovering Data Clouds); (ii) adaptive data dissemination for traffic information systems; (iii) methods for self-recognition of traffic jams. We conclude by describing higher-level aspects of our work.", "authors": [{"name": "sandor p fekete", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100194656"}, {"name": "christiane schmidt", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100587580"}, {"name": "axel wegener", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81363602856"}, {"name": "horst hellbruck", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100543266"}, {"name": "stefan fischer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100312380"}], "title": "Empowered by wireless communication: Distributed methods for self-organizing traffic collectives", "citations": [{"Name": "Rolf P.

Therefore, in OC, we talk aboutcontrolled self-organization.Although the termsself-organizationandadaptivityhave been discussed for years, we miss a clear definition of self-organization in most publications, which have a technically motivated background.In this article, we briefly summarize the state of the art and suggest a characterization of (controlled) self-organization and adaptivity that is motivated by the main objectives of the OC initiative. We present a system classification of robust, adaptable, and adaptive systems and define a degree of autonomy to be able to quantify how autonomously a system is working. The degree of autonomy distinguishes and measures external control that is exerted directly by the user (no autonomy) from internal control of a system which might be fully controlled by an observer/controller architecture that is part of the system (full autonomy). The quantitative degree of autonomy provides the basis for characterizing the notion of controlled self-organization. Furthermore, we discuss several alternatives for the design of organic systems.", "authors": [{"name": "hartmut schmeck", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100300091"}, {"name": "christian muller-schloer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100616943"}, {"name": "emre cakar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81392617644"}, {"name": "moez mnif", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81363605299"}, {"name": "urban richter", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413599777"}], "title": "Adaptivity and self-organization in organic computing systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Rolf P.

In other words, the user should not have to program each device or connect them together to achieve the required functionality. However, although it is possible for a human operator to specify an active space configuration explicitly, the size, sophistication, and dynamic requirements of modern living environment demand that they have autonomous intelligence satisfying the needs of inhabitants without human intervention. This work presents a proposal for AmI fuzzy computing that exploits multiagent systems and fuzzy theory to realize a long-life learning strategy able to generate context-aware-based fuzzy services and actualize them through abstraction techniques in order to maximize the users' comfort and hardware interoperability level. Experimental results show that proposed approach is capable of anticipating user's requirements by automatically generating the most suitable collection of interoperable fuzzy services.", "authors": [{"name": "giovanni acampora", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100552077"}, {"name": "matteo gaeta", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100280991"}, {"name": "vincenzo loia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100415437"}, {"name": "athanasios v vasilakos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100083052"}], "title": "Interoperable and adaptive fuzzy services for ambient intelligence applications", "citations": [{"Name": "M.

This includes interactions with remote resources as well as with their current physical environment. We have developed the so-called Ad hoc Service Grid (ASG) infrastructure that supports the latter form of interactions. It allows operators to cover arbitrary locations with ambient services in a drop-and-deploy fashion. An ambient service may autonomously distribute (replicate and migrate) within an ASG network to optimize its availability, response times, and network usage. In this article, we propose a fully decentralized, dynamic, and adaptive service placement algorithm for AmI environments like the ASG. This algorithm achieves a coordinated global placement pattern that minimizes the communication costs without any central controller. It does not even require additional communication among the replicas. Moreover, placement patterns stabilize if no changes occur in the environment while replicas still retain their ability to adapt. Mechanisms for self-organized placement of services are very important for AmI environments in general since they allow for autonomous adaptations to dynamic changes and, thus, remove the need for manual (re)configuration of a running system. We present a detailed evaluation of the algorithm's performance and compare it with three other algorithms to show its competitiveness. Furthermore, we discuss how the desired self-organizing behavior emerges from the interactions of a few simple, local rules that govern the individual placement decisions. In order to do so, we give an in-depth analysis of a series of emergent effects that are not directly encoded into the placement algorithm but stem from its collective dynamics.", "authors": [{"name": "klaus herrmann", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100504794"}], "title": "Self-organized service placement in ambient intelligence environments", "citations": [{"Name": "Daniel Merkle ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Martin Middendorf ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alexander Scheidler", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marcio E.

The main goal of the proposed fuzzy-based intelligent embedded agents (F-IAS) includes learning the overall network configuration and adapting to the system functionality to personalize themselves to the user needs based on monitoring the user in a lifelong nonintrusive mode. In addition, the F-IAS agents aim to reduce the agent interconnections to the most relevant set of agents in order to reduce the processing overheads and thus implicitly improving the system overall efficiency. We employ embedded ambassador agents, namely embassadors, which are designated F-IAS agents utilized with additional novel characteristics to not only act as a gateway filtering the number of messages multicast across societies but also discover, recommend, and establish associations between agents residing in separate societies. In order to validate the efficiency of the proposed methods for multiagent and society-based intelligent association discovery and learning of F-IAS agents/embassadors we will present two sets of unique experiments. The first experiment describes the obtained results carried out within the intelligent Dormitory (iDorm) which is a real-world testbed for AIE research. Here we specifically demonstrate the utilization of the F-IAS agents and discuss that by optimizing the set of associations the agents increase efficiency and performance. The second set of experiments is based on emulating an iDorm-like large-scale multi-society-based AIE environment. The results illustrate how embassadors discover strongly correlated agent pairs and cause them to form associations so that relevant agents of separate societies can start interacting with each other.", "authors": [{"name": "hakan duman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100647370"}, {"name": "hani hagras", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100566287"}, {"name": "victor callaghan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100016265"}], "title": "A multi-society-based intelligent association discovery and selection for ambient intelligence environments", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "130\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "112\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "541\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of essex", "affiliation_string": "university of essex colchester united kingdom", "city": "colchester", "Name": "hakan duman"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of essex", "affiliation_string": "university of essex colchester united kingdom", "city": "colchester", "Name": "hani hagras"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of essex", "affiliation_string": "university of essex colchester united kingdom", "city": "colchester", "Name": "victor callaghan"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/1740600.1740601", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "vincenzo loia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100415437"}, {"name": "athanasios v vasilakos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100083052"}], "title": "Editorial: Special issue on ambient intelligence", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "9\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "274\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "italy", "university": "university of salerno", "affiliation_string": "university of salerno", "city": "salerno", "Name": "vincenzo loia"}]}}, "date": {"month": "May", "year": "2010"}}}, "Volume7": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Article No.: 37": {"references": ["Karl Aberer , Anwitaman Datta , Manfred Hauswirth, Multifaceted simultaneous load balancing in DHT-Based p2p systems: a new game with old balls and bins, Self-star Properties in Complex Information Systems: conceptual and Practical Foundations, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2005\n", "Jeannie Albrecht , David Oppenheimer , Amin Vahdat , David A.

This raises the need for scalable resource selection services that identify resources that match application requirements. Such a service must provide an efficient lookup in spite of changing resource attributes such as disk size, changing application requirements such as installed software libraries, and changing system composition as resources join or leave. We present a fully decentralized, self-managing Resource Selection Service (RSS) algorithm by which resources autonomously select themselves when their attributes match a query. An application specifies what it expects from a resource by means of a conjunction of (attribute,value-range) pairs, which are matched against the attribute values of resources. The set of search attributes can also be updated online to reflect new requirements. We show that our solution scales in the number of resources and in the number of attributes, while being relatively insensitive to churn and other membership changes like node failures. Our RSS continuously self-adapts its routing structure in response to variations in the distribution of node attributes and queries. We show that this autonomous optimization maintains performance and availability in a long-lived service even when the set of application requirements used to select resources changes.", "authors": [{"name": "corina stratan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367597345"}, {"name": "jan sacha", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81326492265"}, {"name": "jeff napper", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81440594759"}, {"name": "paolo costa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100281361"}, {"name": "guillaume pierre", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100105037"}], "title": "The XtreemOS Resource Selection Service", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "12\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "161\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "vu university amsterdam", "city": null, "Name": "corina stratan"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "bell labs", "city": null, "Name": "jan sacha"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "bell labs", "city": null, "Name": "jeff napper"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "imperial college london", "affiliation_string": "imperial college london", "city": "london", "Name": "paolo costa"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "vu university amsterdam", "city": null, "Name": "guillaume pierre"}]}, "Article No.: 38": {"references": ["Fuad Abujarad , Sandeep S.

Once an SS protocol reaches a legitimate state, it remains in the set of legitimate states as long as there are no faults, called theclosureproperty. Distribution issues exacerbate the design complexity of SS protocols as processes should collaborate and take local actions that result in global convergence. Most existing design techniques are manual, and mainly focus on protocols whose global state can be corrected if the local states of all processes are corrected, called thelocally correctableprotocols. After manual design, an SS protocol has to be verified for closure and convergence. Previous work observes that verifying SS protocols is a harder problem than designing them as developers have to ensure the correctness of closure and convergence functionalities and their noninterference. An algorithmic method for the design of convergence generates protocols that are correct by construction, thereby eliminating the need for verification.In order to facilitate the design of SS protocols, this article presents a lightweight method for algorithmic addition of convergence to finite-state nonstabilizing protocols, including nonlocally correctable protocols. The proposed method enables thereuseof design efforts in the development of different self-stabilizing protocols. Moreover, for the first time (to the best of our knowledge), this article presents an algorithmic method for the addition of convergence to symmetric protocols that consist of structurally similar processes. The proposed approach is supported by a software tool that automatically adds convergence to nonstabilizing protocols. We have used the proposed method/tool to automatically generate several self-stabilizing protocols with up to 40 processes (and 340states) in a few minutes on a regular PC. Surprisingly, our tool has synthesized both protocols that are the same as their manually designed versions as well as alternative solutions for well-known problems in the literature (e.g., Dijkstra\u2019s token ring, maximal matching, graph coloring, agreement and leader election in a ring). Moreover, the proposed method has helped us detect a design flaw in a manually designed self-stabilizing protocol.", "authors": [{"name": "aly farahat", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490661303"}, {"name": "ali ebnenasir", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319491105"}], "title": "A Lightweight Method for Automated Design of Convergence in Network Protocols", "citations": [{"Name": "Alex P.

Most notably, the approach allows peer indexes and resource keys to be defined on different and independent spaces, so that it overcomes the main limitation of standard structured P2P systems, that is, the need to assign each key to a peer having a specified index. This helps to improve load balancing, especially when the popularity distribution of resource keys is nonuniform, and enables the efficient execution of complex and range queries, which are essential in important types of distributed systems, for example, in Grids and Clouds. Beyond describing the general approach, this article focuses on the specific case of Self-CAN, a self-organizing P2P system that, while relying on the multidimensional structured organization of peers provided by CAN, exploits the operations of ant-based mobile agents to sort the resource keys and distribute them to peers. This system is particularly useful for the management and discovery of the resources that can be conveniently characterized by the values of several independent attributes.", "authors": [{"name": "raffaele giordanelli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81486654667"}, {"name": "carlo mastroianni", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100481306"}, {"name": "michela meo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81371591182"}], "title": "Bio-Inspired P2P Systems: The Case of Multidimensional Overlay", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "18\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "241\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carlo mastroianni", "city": null, "Name": "raffaele giordanelli"}, {"country": "italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "politecnico di torino italy", "city": null, "Name": "michela meo"}]}, "Article No.: 39": {"references": ["Agrawal, A.2001.

In such systems, there is decentralized control, competition for resources and an expectation of both intentional and unintentional errors. The \u201coptimal\u201d distribution of resources is then less important than the endurance of the distribution mechanism. Under these circumstances, we propose to model resource allocation as a common-pool resource management problem, and develop a formal characterization of Elinor Ostrom\u2019s socio-economic principles for self-governing institutions. This article applies a method for sociologically inspired computing to give a complete axiomatization of six of Ostrom\u2019s eight principles in the Event Calculus. A testbed is implemented for experimenting with the axiomatization. The experimental results show that these principles support enduring institutions, in terms of longevity and membership, and also provide insight into calibrating the transaction and running costs associated with implementing the principles against the behavioral profile of the institutional membership. We conclude that it is possible to express Ostrom\u2019s principles in logical form and that they are necessary and sufficient conditions for enduring self-organizing electronic institutions to manage sustainable common-pool resources.", "authors": [{"name": "jeremy pitt", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81340491827"}, {"name": "julia schaumeier", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490686491"}, {"name": "alexander artikis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100453669"}], "title": "Axiomatization of Socio-Economic Principles for Self-Organizing Institutions: Concepts, Experiments and Challenges", "citations": [{"Name": "Ana Peleteiro ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Juan C.

Different decision mechanisms are considered in the literature, but in the vast majority of the cases a single technique is applied to a given instance of the problem. This article proposes a comparison of some state of the art approaches for decision making, applied to a self-optimizing autonomic system that allocates resources to a software application. A variety of decision mechanisms, from heuristics to control-theory and machine learning, are investigated. The results obtained with these solutions are compared by means of case studies using standard benchmarks. Our results indicate that the most suitable decision mechanism can vary depending on the specific test case but adaptive and model predictive control systems tend to produce good performance and may work best in a priori unknown situations.", "authors": [{"name": "martina maggio", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81486647269"}, {"name": "henry hoffmann", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81416603389"}, {"name": "alessandro v papadopoulos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81550658656"}, {"name": "jacopo panerati", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81550305656"}, {"name": "marco d santambrogio", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100464692"}, {"name": "anant agarwal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548029498"}, {"name": "alberto leva", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339512446"}], "title": "Comparison of Decision-Making Strategies for Self-Optimization in Autonomic Computing Systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Jacopo Panerati ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Martina Maggio ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Matteo Carminati ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Filippo Sironi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marco Triverio ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marco D.

Inspired by the recent findings in biology indicating that morphogen gradients, together with a Gene Regulatory Network (GRN), play a key role in biological patterning, we propose a framework for self-organized multirobot pattern formation and boundary coverage based on an artificial GRN model. The proposed framework does not need a global coordinate system, which makes it more practical to be implemented in a physical robotic system. Moreover, an adaptation mechanism is included in the framework so that the self-organization algorithm is robust to changes in the number of robots.

This class of application will have a multilayer architecture, where each layer is likely to use languages and technologies appropriate to its own concerns. An example application is a geographically large-scale crisis management system. Typically, such applications are required to dynamically adapt their behavior based on current circumstances, with adaptations potentially affecting all layers of the application. The complexities involved in dynamically adapting multilayer applications will significantly benefit from formal approaches to its specification.This article presents a new methodology for flexible, multilayer application adaptation, with layer-specific adaptation solution templates bound to application mismatches that are organized into hierarchical taxonomies. Templates can be linked either through direct invocations or through adaptation events, supporting flexible cross-layer adaptation. The methodology illustrates the use of different formalisms for different elements of its specification. In particular, we combine semiformal metamodeling techniques for the system model specification with formal Petri nets, which are used to capture template matchmaking using reachability analysis. This work demonstrates how existing formalisms can be used for the specification of a generic adaptation model for pervasive applications.", "authors": [{"name": "razvan popescu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367598512"}, {"name": "athanasios staikopoulos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453652023"}, {"name": "antonio brogi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100026201"}, {"name": "peng liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474657433"}, {"name": "siobhan clarke", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100390540"}], "title": "A formalized, taxonomy-driven approach to cross-layer application adaptation", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "25\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "380\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "ireland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "trinity college dublin dublin ireland", "city": null, "Name": "razvan popescu"}, {"country": "ireland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "trinity college dublin dublin ireland", "city": null, "Name": "athanasios staikopoulos"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of pisa", "affiliation_string": "university of pisa italy", "city": "pisa", "Name": "antonio brogi"}, {"country": "ireland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "trinity college dublin dublin ireland", "city": null, "Name": "peng liu"}, {"country": "ireland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "trinity college dublin dublin ireland", "city": null, "Name": "siobhan clarke"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Ahn, Y.-Y., Bagrow, J.

The approach presented in this article relies on a simple algorithm to let a sensor network self-organize a virtual partitioning in correspondence to spatial regions characterized by similar sensing patterns, and to let distributed aggregation of sensorial data take place on a per-region basis. The result of this process is that a sensor network can be modeled as a collection of virtual macro sensors, each associated to a well-characterized region of the physical environment. Within each region, each physical sensor has the local availability of aggregated data about its region and is able to act as an access point to such data. This feature promises to be very suitable for a number of emerging usage scenarios. Our approach is described and evaluated in both a simulation environment and a real test bed, and quantitatively compared with related works in the area. Current limitations and areas of future development are also discussed.", "authors": [{"name": "nicola bicocchi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330488302"}, {"name": "marco mamei", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100451227"}, {"name": "franco zambonelli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100268981"}], "title": "Self-organizing virtual macro sensors", "citations": [{"Name": "Gabriella Castelli ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marco Mamei ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alberto Rosi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Franco Zambonelli", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "21\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "218\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "italy", "university": "university of modena", "affiliation_string": "university of modena and reggio emilia", "city": "modena", "Name": "nicola bicocchi"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of modena", "affiliation_string": "university of modena and reggio emilia", "city": "modena", "Name": "marco mamei"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of modena", "affiliation_string": "university of modena and reggio emilia", "city": "modena", "Name": "franco zambonelli"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Astr\u00f6m, K.

More specifically, we deal with the problem of dynamic, intraquery load balancing in parallel database queries across heterogeneous nodes in a way that takes into account the inherent cost of adaptations and thus avoids both overreacting and deciding when to adapt in a completely heuristic manner. The latter may lead to serious performance degradation in several cases, such as periodic and random imbalances. We follow a control theoretical approach to this problem; more specifically, we propose a multiple-input multiple-output feedback linear quadratic regulation (LQR) controller, which captures the tradeoff between reaching a balanced state and the cost inherent in such adaptations. Our approach, apart from benefitting from and being characterized by a solid theoretical foundation, exhibits better performance than state-of-the-art heuristics in realistic situations, as verified by thorough evaluation.", "authors": [{"name": "anastasios gounaris", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100309497"}, {"name": "christos a yfoulis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100061624"}, {"name": "norman w paton", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100419258"}], "title": "Efficient load balancing in partitioned queries under random perturbations", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "14\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "147\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "greece", "university": "aristotle university of thessaloniki", "affiliation_string": "aristotle university of thessaloniki greece", "city": "thessaloniki", "Name": "anastasios gounaris"}, {"country": "Greece", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "alexander technological educational institute of thessaloniki greece", "city": "thessaloniki", "Name": "christos a yfoulis"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of manchester", "affiliation_string": "university of manchester uk", "city": "manchester", "Name": "norman w paton"}]}, "Article No.: 16": {"references": ["Charu C.

These agents typically know how to observe their local environment and how to react on certain observations, for instance, and this knowledge may be represented in form of rules. However, many environments are dynamic in the sense that from time to time novel rules are required or old rules become obsolete. In this article we propose and investigate new techniques for knowledge acquisition by novelty detection and reaction as well as obsoleteness detection and reaction that an agent may use for self-adaptation to new situations. For that purpose we consider classifiers based on probabilistic rules. Premises of new rules are learned autonomously while conclusions are either obtained from human experts or from other agents which have learned appropriate rules in the past. By means of knowledge exchange, agents will efficiently be enabled to cope with situations they were not confronted with before. This kind of collaborative intelligence follows the human archetype: Humans are able to learn from each other by communicating learned rules. We demonstrate some properties of the knowledge acquisition techniques using artificial data as well as data from the field of intrusion detection.", "authors": [{"name": "dominik fisch", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453657526"}, {"name": "dominik fisch", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502676138"}, {"name": "martin janicke", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474703945"}, {"name": "edgar kalkowski", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502803120"}, {"name": "bernhard sick", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81324494019"}], "title": "Techniques for knowledge acquisition in dynamically changing environments", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "41\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "654\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of kassel kassel germany", "city": "kassel", "Name": "dominik fisch"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of kassel kassel germany", "city": "kassel", "Name": "dominik fisch"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of kassel kassel germany", "city": "kassel", "Name": "martin janicke"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of kassel kassel germany", "city": "kassel", "Name": "edgar kalkowski"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of kassel kassel germany", "city": "kassel", "Name": "bernhard sick"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Jose Aguilar , Mariela Cerrada , Francisco Hidrobo, A Methodology to Specify Multiagent Systems, Proceedings of the 1st KES International Symposium on Agent and Multi-Agent Systems: Technologies and Applications, May 31-June 01, 2007, Wroclaw, Poland[doi>10.1007/978-3-540-72830-6_10]\n", "Mohit Aron , Peter Druschel , Willy Zwaenepoel, Cluster reserves: a mechanism for resource management in cluster-based network servers, Proceedings of the 2000 ACM SIGMETRICS international conference on Measurement and modeling of computer systems, p.90-101, June 18-21, 2000, Santa Clara, California, USA[doi>10.1145/339331.339383]\n", "Babaoglu, O. and Jelasity, M. 2008.

A crucial aspect in these pools is to allocate resources so as to ensure their proper usage, taking into account workload and specific requirements of each application. An interesting approach, in this context, is to allocate the resources in the best possible way, aiming at optimal resource usage. Workload, however, varies over time, and in turn, resource demands will vary too. To ensure that optimal resource usage is always in place, resource shares should be defined dynamically and over time. It has been claimed that utility functions are the main tool for enabling such self-optimizing behavior. Whereas many solutions with this characteristic have been proposed to date, none of them presents true decentralization within the context of shared pools. In this article, we then propose a decentralized model for optimal resource usage in shared resource pools, providing practical and theoretical evidence of its feasibility.", "authors": [{"name": "emerson loureiro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309487907"}, {"name": "paddy nixon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332518557"}, {"name": "simon dobson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100486612"}], "title": "Decentralized and optimal control of shared resource pools", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "27\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "268\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "ireland", "university": "university college dublin", "affiliation_string": "university college dublin dublin ireland", "city": "dublin", "Name": "emerson loureiro"}, {"country": "ireland", "university": "university college dublin", "affiliation_string": "university college dublin dublin ireland", "city": "dublin", "Name": "paddy nixon"}, {"country": "ireland", "university": "university college dublin", "affiliation_string": "university college dublin dublin ireland", "city": "dublin", "Name": "simon dobson"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Ame, J., Halloy, J., Rivault, C., Detrain, C., and Denebourg, J. 2006.

We explore the fundamental properties of our framework using a combination of analytical and numerical methods.

Although noteworthy successes have been achieved on many fronts, the construction of such systems remains significantly more challenging than traditional systems. We argue this is partially because researchers and practitioners have been struggling with the lack of a precise vocabulary for describing and reasoning about the key architectural characteristics of self-adaptive systems. Further exacerbating the situation is the fact that existing frameworks and guidelines do not provide an encompassing perspective of the different types of concerns in this setting. In this article, we present a comprehensive reference model, entitled FOrmal Reference Model for Self-adaptation (FORMS), that targets both issues. FORMS provides rigor in the manner such systems can be described and reasoned about. It consists of a small number of formally specified modeling elements that correspond to the key concerns in the design of self-adaptive software systems, and a set of relationships that guide their composition. We demonstrate FORMS's ability to precisely describe and reason about the architectural characteristics of distributed self-adaptive software systems through its application to several existing systems. FORMS's expressive power gives it a potential for documenting reusable architectural solutions (e.g., architectural patterns) to commonly encountered problems in this area.", "authors": [{"name": "danny weyns", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100589653"}, {"name": "sam malek", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100267865"}, {"name": "jesper andersson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81313484945"}], "title": "FORMS: Unifying reference model for formal specification of distributed self-adaptive systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Danny Weyns ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "M.

In order to achieve this level of specificity, systems must be capable of monitoring the psychological status of the user and responding to these changes in real time and across multiple systems if necessary. This article describes a number of conceptual issues associated with this category of adaptive technology. The biocybernetic loop describes different approaches to monitoring the status of the user from physiological sensors to overt behavior. These data are used to drive real time system adaptation tailored to a specific user in a particular context. The rate at which the technology adapts to the individual user are described over three different phases of usage: awareness (short-term), adjustment (medium-term), and coevolution (long-term). An ontology is then proposed for the development of an adaptive software architecture that embodies this approach and may be extended to encompass several distinct loops working in parallel. The feasibility of the approach is assessed through implemented case studies of their performance and functionality.", "authors": [{"name": "nikola serbedzija", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100498696"}, {"name": "stephen fairclough", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100104957"}], "title": "Reflective pervasive systems", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "33\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "350\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "El Salvador", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "fraunhofer first berlin germany", "city": "berlin", "Name": "nikola serbedzija"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "liverpool john moores university", "affiliation_string": "liverpool john moores university uk", "city": "liverpool", "Name": "stephen fairclough"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["Sherief Abdallah , Victor Lesser, Multiagent reinforcement learning and self-organization in a network of agents, Proceedings of the 6th international joint conference on Autonomous agents and multiagent systems, May 14-18, 2007, Honolulu, Hawaii[doi>10.1145/1329125.1329172]\n", "Alexander, G., Raja, A., Durfee, E.

Towards this goal, we demonstrate a robust, decentralized approach for structural adaptation in explicitly modeled problem solving agent organizations.

Specifically, the agents reason about when and how to adapt using only their history of interactions as guidance. We empirically show that, in a wide range of closed, open, static, and dynamic scenarios, the performance of organizations using our method is close (70\u201390&percnt;) to that of an idealized centralized allocation method and is considerably better (10\u201360&percnt;) than the current state-of-the-art decentralized approaches.", "authors": [{"name": "ramachandra kota", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436598533"}, {"name": "nicholas gibbins", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100552195"}, {"name": "nicholas r jennings", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100581072"}], "title": "Decentralized approaches for self-adaptation in agent organizations", "citations": [{"Name": "Kemas M.

DWL supports optimization towards multiple heterogeneous policies and addresses the challenges arising from the heterogeneity of the agents that are charged with implementing them. DWL learns and exploits the dependencies between agents and between policies to improve overall system performance. Instead of always executing the locally-best action, agents learn how their actions affect their immediate neighbors and execute actions suggested by neighboring agents if their importance exceeds the local action's importance when scaled using a predefined or learned collaboration coefficient. We have evaluated DWL in a simulation of an Urban Traffic Control (UTC) system, a canonical example of the large-scale pervasive systems that we are addressing. We show that DWL outperforms widely deployed fixed-time and simple adaptive UTC controllers under a variety of traffic loads and patterns. Our results also confirm that enabling collaboration between agents is beneficial as is the ability for agents to learn the degree to which it is appropriate for them to collaborate. These results suggest that DWL is a suitable basis for optimization in other large-scale systems with similar characteristics.", "authors": [{"name": "ivana dusparic", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100218917"}, {"name": "vinny cahill", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100320323"}], "title": "Autonomic multi-policy optimization in pervasive systems: Overview and evaluation", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "29\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "319\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "trinity college dublin", "city": null, "Name": "ivana dusparic"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "trinity college dublin", "city": null, "Name": "vinny cahill"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Alur, R. and Henzinger, T.

Clustering analysis can be used to find patterns and trends in system operational data, as well as highlight deviations from these patterns. Such analysis can be essential for verifying the correctness and efficiency of the operation of the system, as well as for discovering specific situations of interest, such as anomalies or faults, that require appropriate management actions.This work analyzes the automated application of clustering for online system management, from the point of view of the suitability of different clustering approaches for the online analysis of system data in a distributed environment, with minimal prior knowledge and within a timeframe that allows the timely interpretation of and response to clustering results. For this purpose, we evaluate DOC (Decentralized Online Clustering), a clustering algorithm designed to support data analysis for autonomic management, and compare it to existing and widely used clustering algorithms. The comparative evaluations will show that DOC achieves a good balance in the trade-offs inherent in the challenges for this type of online management.", "authors": [{"name": "andres quiroz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351596171"}, {"name": "manish parashar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100205090"}, {"name": "nathan gnanasambandam", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100129780"}, {"name": "naveen sharma", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100235940"}], "title": "Design and evaluation of decentralized online clustering", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "28\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "233\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "manish parashar", "city": null, "Name": "andres quiroz"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "nathan gnanasambandam", "city": null, "Name": "rutgers university"}]}, "Article No.: 32": {"references": ["Anderson, R. and May, R. 1991.

Early investigations for this purpose adapted biological epidemic models, and thus inherited the so-called homogeneity assumption that each node is equally connected to others. Later studies relaxed this often unrealistic homogeneity assumption, but still focused on certain power-law networks. Recently, researchers investigated epidemic models inarbitrarynetworks (i.e., no restrictions on network topology). However, all these models only capturepush-basedinfection, namely that an infectious node always actively attempts to infect its neighboring nodes. Very recently, the concept ofpull-basedinfection was introduced but was not treated rigorously. Along this line of research, the present article investigates push- and pull-based epidemic spreading dynamics in arbitrary networks, using a nonlinear dynamical systems approach. The article advances the state-of-the-art as follows: (1) It presents a more general and powerful sufficient condition (also known as epidemic threshold in the literature) under which the spreading will become stable. (2) It gives both upper and lower bounds on the global mean infection rate, regardless of the stability of the spreading. (3) It offers insights into, among other things, the estimation of the global mean infection rate through localized monitoring of a smallconstantnumber of nodes,withoutknowing the values of the parameters.", "authors": [{"name": "shouhuai xu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100195423"}, {"name": "wenlian lu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548650856"}, {"name": "li xu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81549498456"}], "title": "Push- and pull-based epidemic spreading in networks: Thresholds and deeper insights", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "32\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "287\n", "Citation Count": "6\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Mali", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of texas at san antonio tx", "city": "san", "Name": "shouhuai xu"}, {"country": "china", "university": "fudan university", "affiliation_string": "fudan university pr china", "city": "shanghai", "Name": "wenlian lu"}, {"country": "Mali", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of texas at san antonio tx", "city": "san", "Name": "li xu"}]}, "Article No.: 30": {"references": ["Abbott, L.

First, we prove that inhibitory coupling can lead to perfect synchrony independent of initial conditions for delay-free environments and homogeneous oscillators. Second, relaxing the assumptions to systems with delays and different phase rates, we prove that such systems synchronize up to a certain precision bound. We derive this bound assuming inhomogeneous delays and show by simulations that it gives a good estimate in strongly-coupled systems. Third, we show that inhibitory coupling with self-adjustment quickly leads to synchrony with a precision comparable to that of excitatory coupling. Fourth, we analyze the robustness against faulty members performing incorrect coupling. While the specific precision-loss encountered by such disturbances depends on system parameters, the system always regains synchrony for the investigated scenarios.", "authors": [{"name": "johannes klinglmayr", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548911656"}, {"name": "christian bettstetter", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100343443"}], "title": "Self-organizing synchronization with inhibitory-coupled oscillators: Convergence and robustness", "citations": [{"Name": "Nikos Deligiannis ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jo\u00e3o F.

However, few works systematically investigate the effect of the intrinsic heterogeneities on the evolutionary dynamics of incentive mechanisms in autonomous networks. In this article, we thoroughly discuss this interesting problem. Specifically, this article respectively models the pairwise interaction between peers as PD (prisoner's dilemma)-like game and multiple peers' interactions as public-goods game, proposes a general analytical framework for dynamics in evolutionary game theory (EGT)-based incentive mechanisms, and draws the following conclusions. First, for explicit incentive mechanisms, due to heterogeneity, it is impossible to get the static equilibrium of absolutely-full-cooperation (or state that provides service to the networks\u2014so-called reciprocation), but, on the other hand, heterogeneity can facilitate reciprocation evolution, and drive the whole system into almost-full-reciprocation state, that is, most of the system time would be occupied by the full reciprocation state. Second, even without any explicit incentive mechanisms, simultaneous coevolution between dynamic linking and peers' rational strategies can not only facilitate the cooperation evolution, but drive the network structure into the desirable small-world structure. The philosophical implication of our work is that simplicity and homogeneity are too idealized for incentive mechanisms in autonomous networks\u2014diversity and heterogeneity are intrinsic for any incentive mechanism that is compatible with the essence of our real society.

More precisely, an RWC provides linear(n,r,d)-codes that have: (a) minimum (Hamming) distanced = n-r&plus;1for any two codewords, and (b) for any codewordy1there exists a codewordy2with distance of at mostw. Furthermore, depending on the valuesr,wand the code alphabet, different block codes such as parity codes (e.g., RAID 4/5) or Reed-Solomon (RS) codes (ifr = kand thus,w = n) can be generated. In storage networks in which I/O accesses are very costly and redundancy is crucial, this flexibility has considerable advantages asrandwcan optimally be adapted to read or write intensive applications; onlywsymbols must be updated if the messagexchanges completely, which is different from other codes that always need to rewriteycompletely asxchanges. In this article, we first state a tight lower bound and basic conditions for all RW codes. Furthermore, we introduce special RW codes in which all mentioned parameters are adjustable even online, that is, RW codes which are adaptive to changing demands.

We first present a practical scheme for anonymous transactions while the transaction resolution is assisted by a Trusted Authority. This practical scheme is extended to a theoretical scheme where a Trusted Authority is not involved in the transaction resolution. Both schemes assume that all the players interact over anonymous secure channels. Given authority that generates for each player hard to produce evidenceEVID(e.g., problem instance with or without a solution) to each player, the identity of a userUis defined by the ability to prove possession of aforementioned evidence. We use zero-knowledge proof techniques to repeatedly identifyUby providing a proof thatUhas evidenceEVID, without revealingEVID, therefore avoiding identity theft.In both schemes the authority provides each user with a unique random string. A playerUmay produce a unique user name and password for each other playerSusing a one-way function over the random string and theIPaddress ofS. The player does not have to maintain any information in order to reproduce the user name and password used for accessing a playerS. Moreover, the playerUmay execute transactions with a group of playersSUin two phases; in the first phase the player interacts with each server without revealing information concerning its identity and without possibly identifying linkability among the servers inSU. In the second phase the player allows linkability and therefore transaction commitment with all servers inSU, while preserving anonymity (for future transactions).", "authors": [{"name": "shlomi dolev", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100628546"}, {"name": "marina kopeetsky", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453660506"}], "title": "Anonymous transactions in computer networks", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "37\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "260\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ben-gurion university of the negev beer-sheva israel", "city": "negev", "Name": "shlomi dolev"}, {"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "sami-shamoon college of engineering beer-sheva israel", "city": "beer-sheva", "Name": "marina kopeetsky"}]}, "Article No.: 18": {"references": ["Arnold O.

In earlier work, it was shown that QoS adaptation should be dependable, if correctness of protocol properties is to be maintained. More recently, some ideas concerning specific strategies and methodologies for improving QoS adaptation have been proposed. In this article we describeAdaptare, a complete framework for dependable QoS adaptation. We assume that during its lifetime, a system alternates periods where its temporal behavior is well characterized, with transition periods during which a variation of the environment conditions occurs. Our method is based on the following: if the environment is generically characterized in analytical terms, and we can detect the alternation of these stable and transient phases, we can improve the effectiveness and dependability of QoS adaptation. To prove our point we provide detailed evaluation results of the proposed solutions. Our evaluation is based on synthetic data flows generated from probabilistic distributions, as well as on real data traces collected in various Internet-based environments. We compare our solution with other approaches and we show that Adaptare, albeit more complex, is very effective, allowing protocols to adapt to the available resources in a dependable way.", "authors": [{"name": "monica dixit", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474651663"}, {"name": "antonio casimiro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100319204"}, {"name": "paolo lollini", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100143991"}, {"name": "andrea bondavalli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100113003"}, {"name": "paulo verissimo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409593162"}], "title": "Adaptare: Supporting automatic and dependable adaptation in dynamic environments", "citations": [{"Name": "M\u00f4nica Dixit ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Henrique Moniz ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ant\u00f3nio Casimiro", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "20\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "281\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "portugal", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of lisboa portugal", "city": null, "Name": "monica dixit"}, {"country": "portugal", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of lisboa portugal", "city": null, "Name": "antonio casimiro"}, {"country": "portugal", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of firenze portugal", "city": null, "Name": "paolo lollini"}, {"country": "portugal", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of firenze portugal", "city": null, "Name": "andrea bondavalli"}, {"country": "portugal", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of lisboa portugal", "city": null, "Name": "paulo verissimo"}]}, "Article No.: 28": {"references": ["Atul Adya , William J.

We study in this article the problem of finding peers matching a given availability pattern in a peer-to-peer (P2P) system. Motivated by practical examples, we specify two formal problems of availability matching that arise in real applications:disconnection matching, where peers look for partners expected to disconnect at the same time, andpresence matching, where peers look for partners expected to be online simultaneously in the future. As a scalable and inexpensive solution, we propose to use epidemic protocols for topology management; we provide corresponding metrics for both matching problems. We evaluated this solution by simulating two P2P applications,task schedulingandfile storage, over a new trace of the eDonkey network, the largest one with availability information. We first proved the existence of regularity patterns in the sessions of 14M peers over 27 days. We also showed that, using only 7 days of history, a simple predictor could select predictable peers and successfully predicted their online periods for the next week. Finally, simulations showed that our simple solution provided good partners fast enough to match the needs of both applications, and that consequently, these applications performed as efficiently at a much lower cost. This solution is purely distributed as it does not rely on any central server or oracle to operate.

In addition to communication protocols, this technique can be used as inexpensive and efficient density estimation of physical entities in highly dynamic scenarios. Stability conditions are proposed by means of a rigorous theoretical investigation. We prove that our algorithm ensures stability even with unknown and time--varying network topologies. We show that good channel exploitation levels can be assured as well by suitably tuning the control parameters. A digital algorithm for practical implementation is proposed.

A firewall determines whether to accept or discard a packet that passes through it based on its policy. However, most real-life firewalls have been plagued with policy faults, which either allow malicious traffic or block legitimate traffic. Due to the complexity of firewall policies, manually locating the faults of a firewall policy and further correcting them are difficult. Automatically correcting the faults of a firewall policy is an important and challenging problem. In this article, we first propose a fault model for firewall policies including five types of faults. For each type of fault, we present an automatic correction technique. Second, we propose the first systematic approach that employs these five techniques to automatically correct all or part of the misclassified packets of a faulty firewall policy. Third, we conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Experimental results show that our approach is effective to correct a faulty firewall policy with three of these types of faults.", "authors": [{"name": "fei chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367592383"}, {"name": "alex x liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100526335"}, {"name": "jeehyun hwang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339506225"}, {"name": "tao xie", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314487030"}], "title": "First step towards automatic correction of firewall policy faults", "citations": [{"Name": "Shambwaditya Saha ", "Country": "sudan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Santhosh Prabhu ", "Country": "sudan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "P.

Practical experiences, however, show that DE is vulnerable to problems like slow and/or premature convergence. In this article we propose a simple and modified DE framework, called MDE, which is a fusion of three recent modifications in DE: (1) Opposition-Based Learning (OBL); (2) tournament method for mutation; and (3) single population structure. These features have a specific role which helps in improving the performance of DE. While OBL helps in giving a good initial start to DE, the use of the tournament best base vector in the mutation phase helps in preserving the diversity. Finally the single population structure helps in faster convergence. Their synergized effect balances the exploitation and exploration capabilities of DE without compromising with the solution quality or the convergence rate. The proposed MDE is validated on a set of 25 standard benchmark problems, 7 nontraditional shifted benchmark functions proposed at the special session of CEC2008, and three engineering design problems. Numerical results and statistical analysis show that the proposed MDE is better than or at least comparable to the basic DE and several other state-of-the art DE variants.", "authors": [{"name": "musrrat ali", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375601312"}, {"name": "millie pant", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339521159"}, {"name": "ajith abraham", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100436432"}], "title": "Improving differential evolution algorithm by synergizing different improvement mechanisms", "citations": [{"Name": "Yan Pei", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chaotic Evolution: fusion of chaotic ergodicity and evolutionary iteration for optimization", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "37\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "276\n", "Citation Count": "5\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "india", "university": "indian institute of technology roorkee", "affiliation_string": "indian institute of technology roorkee india", "city": "rurki", "Name": "musrrat ali"}, {"country": "india", "university": "indian institute of technology roorkee", "affiliation_string": "indian institute of technology roorkee india", "city": "rurki", "Name": "millie pant"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "machine intelligence research mir labs wa", "city": null, "Name": "ajith abraham"}]}, "Article No.: 24": {"references": ["Akaiwa, Y. and Andoh, H. 1992.

They must provide a growing variety of services to a wide range of devices. In order to do so, they must make efficient use of modern technologies including MIMO, macrodiversity, power control, channel allocation, beamforming, and so on.In this context, the centralized management of radio resources on a large scale is rapidly becoming intractable. Distributed intelligence constitutes an increasingly attractive solution to provide network-wide self-configuration and adaptation capabilities. This article presents the design of a swarming system for autonomous power control which adapts naturally to the changing conditions of mobile networks where interference patterns are in constant flux. Empirical methods proposed by Parunak [1997] to develop MultiAgent Systems with Swarming (MASS) are applied to the current context while emphasizing the key concepts that lead to swarming (emergent behavior). A simulation-based study reveals how the system can be fine-tuned to obtain various solutions, balancing resources differently to achieve different trade-off points. Finally, it is shown that the distributed approach based on swarming is not only feasible but leads to higher global QoS levels than comparable centralized approaches.", "authors": [{"name": "philippe leroux", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453609130"}, {"name": "sebastien roy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100654049"}], "title": "Designing and optimizing swarming in a distributed base station network: Application to power control", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "12\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "104\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "canada", "university": "universite laval", "affiliation_string": "universite laval quebec canada", "city": "quebec", "Name": "philippe leroux"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "universite laval", "affiliation_string": "universite laval quebec canada", "city": "quebec", "Name": "sebastien roy"}]}, "Article No.: 17": {"references": ["Axelrod, R. 1984.

Generally, overlay networks are heterogeneous, dynamic, and distributed environments managed by multiple administrative authorities, shared by users with different and competing interests, or even autonomously provided by independent and rational users. Thus, the structure of a whole overlay network and the peers' rational strategies are ever coevolving. However, there are very few approaches that theoretically investigate the coevolution between network structure and individual rational behaviors. The main motivation of our article lies in that: Unlike existing work which empirically illustrates the interaction between rational strategies and network structure (through simulations), based on EGT (Evolutionary Game Theory), we not only infer a condition that could favor the cooperative strategy over defect strategy, but also theoretically characterizes the structural properties of the formed network. Specifically, our contributions are twofold. First, we strictly derive the critical benefit-to-cost ratio (b/c) that would facilitate the evolution of cooperation. The critical ratio depends on the network structure (the number of peers in system and the average degree of each peer), and the evolutionary rule (the strategy and linking mutation probabilities). Then, according to the evolutionary rules, we formally derive the structural properties of the formed network in full cooperative state. Especially, the degree distribution is compatible with the power-law, and the exponent is (4-3v)/(1-3v), wherevis peer's linking mutation probability. Furthermore, we show that, without being harmful to cooperation evolution, a slight change of the evolutionary rule will evolve the network into a small-world structure (high global efficiency and average clustering coefficient), with the same power-law degree distribution as in the original evolution model.", "authors": [{"name": "yufeng wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81414594137"}, {"name": "akihiro nakao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309504097"}, {"name": "athanasios v vasilakos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100083052"}], "title": "On modeling of coevolution of strategies and structure in autonomous overlay networks", "citations": [{"Name": "Yufeng Wang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Akihiro Nakao ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Athanasios V.

The goal is to automatically optimize replica placement in a way that leverages locality patterns in data accesses, such that internode communication is minimized. To do this efficiently is extremely challenging, as one needs not only to find lightweight and scalable ways to identify the right assignment of data replicas to nodes but also to preserve fast data lookup. The article introduces new techniques that address these challenges. The first challenge is addressed by optimizing, in a decentralized way, the placement of the objects generating the largest number of remote operations for each node. The second challenge is addressed by combining the usage of consistent hashing with a novel data structure, which provides efficient probabilistic data placement. These techniques have been integrated in a popular open-source key-value store. The performance results show that the throughput of the optimized system can be six times better than a baseline system employing the widely used static placement based on consistent hashing.", "authors": [{"name": "joao paiva", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81470646617"}, {"name": "pedro ruivo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81496685732"}, {"name": "paolo romano", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81491640501"}, {"name": "luis rodrigues", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452610191"}], "title": "AutoPlacer: Scalable Self-Tuning Data Placement in Distributed Key-Value Stores", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "146\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "210\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "portugal", "university": "universidade de lisboa", "affiliation_string": "inesc-id instituto superior tecnico universidade de lisboa portugal", "city": "lisbon", "Name": "joao paiva"}, {"country": "Canada", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "red hat inc london united kingdom", "city": "london", "Name": "pedro ruivo"}, {"country": "portugal", "university": "universidade de lisboa", "affiliation_string": "inesc-id instituto superior tecnico universidade de lisboa portugal", "city": "lisbon", "Name": "paolo romano"}, {"country": "portugal", "university": "universidade de lisboa", "affiliation_string": "inesc-id instituto superior tecnico universidade de lisboa portugal", "city": "lisbon", "Name": "luis rodrigues"}]}, "Article No.: 18": {"references": ["Christopher Amato, Jilles Steeve Dibangoye, and Shlomo Zilberstein. 2009.

We particularly favor alternate learning, where agents alternately learn best responses to each other, which appears to outperform concurrent RL.

We propose two principled approaches to generating informed initial policies: a naive approach that lays the foundation for a more sophisticated approach.

Traditionally, robot swarms have been developed using a code-and-fix approach: in a bottom-up iterative process, the developer tests and improves the individual behaviors of the robots until the desired collective behavior is obtained. The code-and-fix approach is unstructured, and the quality of the obtained swarm depends completely on the expertise and ingenuity of the developer who has little scientific or technical support in his activity. Property-driven design aims at providing such scientific and technical support, with many advantages compared to the traditional unstructured approach. Property-driven design is composed of four phases: first, the developer formally specifies the requirements of the robot swarm by stating its desired properties; second, the developer creates a prescriptive model of the swarm and uses model checking to verify that this prescriptive model satisfies the desired properties; third, using the prescriptive model as a blueprint, the developer implements a simulated version of the desired robot swarm and validates the prescriptive model developed in the previous step; fourth, the developer implements the desired robot swarm and validates the previous steps. We demonstrate property-driven design using two case studies: aggregation and foraging.", "authors": [{"name": "manuele brambilla", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474672164"}, {"name": "arne brutschy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384595972"}, {"name": "marco dorigo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81337488576"}, {"name": "mauro birattari", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100346347"}], "title": "Property-Driven Design for Robot Swarms: A Design Method Based on Prescriptive Modeling and Model Checking", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "127\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "179\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "belgium", "university": "universite libre de bruxelles", "affiliation_string": "iridia universite libre de bruxelles brussels belgium", "city": "brussels", "Name": "manuele brambilla"}, {"country": "belgium", "university": "universite libre de bruxelles", "affiliation_string": "iridia universite libre de bruxelles brussels belgium", "city": "brussels", "Name": "arne brutschy"}, {"country": "belgium", "university": "universite libre de bruxelles", "affiliation_string": "iridia universite libre de bruxelles brussels belgium", "city": "brussels", "Name": "marco dorigo"}, {"country": "belgium", "university": "universite libre de bruxelles", "affiliation_string": "iridia universite libre de bruxelles brussels belgium", "city": "brussels", "Name": "mauro birattari"}]}, "Article No.: 20": {"references": ["Albertus Agung and Ford Lumban Gaol. 2012.

However, in practical complex environments, the interactions between agents can be sparse, and each agent's interacting partners may change frequently and randomly. To this end, we investigate the multiagent coordination problems in cooperative environments under a social learning framework. We consider a large population of agents where each agent interacts with another agent randomly chosen from the population in each round. Each agent learns its policy through repeated interactions with the rest of the agents via social learning. It is not clear a priori if all agents can learn a consistent optimal coordination policy in such a situation. We distinguish two different types of learners depending on the amount of information each agent can perceive:individual action learner and joint action learner. The learning performance of both types of learners is evaluated under a number of challenging deterministic and stochastic cooperative games, and the influence of the information sharing degree on the learning performance also is investigated\u2014a key difference from the learning framework involving repeated interactions among fixed agents.", "authors": [{"name": "jianye hao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658629402"}, {"name": "ho-fung leung", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100299654"}, {"name": "zhong ming", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100136462"}], "title": "Multiagent Reinforcement Social Learning toward Coordination in Cooperative Multiagent Systems", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "128\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "12\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "185\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "china", "university": "shenzhen university", "affiliation_string": "massachusetts institute of technology shenzhen university cambridge ma usa", "city": "shenzhen", "Name": "jianye hao"}, {"country": "hong kong", "university": "university of hong kong", "affiliation_string": "the chinese university of hong kong shatin hong kong", "city": "xianggangdao", "Name": "ho-fung leung"}, {"country": "china", "university": "shenzhen university", "affiliation_string": "shenzhen university china", "city": "shenzhen", "Name": "zhong ming"}]}, "Article No.: 21": {"references": ["Zahra Abbasi , Georgios Varsamopoulos , Sandeep K.

Adaptive sampling and sleep scheduling can help realize the much needed resource efficiency by minimizing the communication and processing overhead in densely deployed autonomic sensor-based systems. The proposed solution exploits the spatiotemporal correlation in sensed data and eliminates redundancy in transmitted data through selective representation without compromising on accuracy of reconstruction of the monitored phenomenon at a remote monitor node. Differently from existing adaptive sampling solutions, SILENCE employs temporal causality analysis to not only track the variation in the underlying phenomenon but also its cause and direction of propagation in the field. The causality analysis and the same correlations are then leveraged for adaptive sleep scheduling aimed at saving energy in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). SILENCE outperforms traditional adaptive sampling solutions as well as the recently proposed compressive sampling techniques.

The adaptation process is based on the ability to change specific characteristics of parallel components (e.g., their parallelism degree) and to guarantee that such modifications of the application configuration are effective and durable. Reconfigurations often incur a cost on the execution (a performance overhead and/or an economic cost). For this reason advanced adaptation strategies have become of paramount importance. Effective strategies must achieve properties like control optimality (making decisions that optimize the global application QoS), reconfiguration stability expressed in terms of the average time between consecutive reconfigurations of the same component, and optimizing the reconfiguration amplitude (number of allocated/deallocated resources). To control such parameters, in this article we propose a method based on a Cooperative Model-based Predictive Control approach in which application controllers cooperate to make optimal reconfigurations and taking account of the durability and amplitude of their control decisions. The effectiveness and the feasibility of the methodology is demonstrated through experiments performed in a simulation environment and by comparing it with other existing techniques.", "authors": [{"name": "gabriele mencagli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81416607295"}, {"name": "marco vanneschi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100149986"}, {"name": "emanuele vespa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83058830257"}], "title": "A Cooperative Predictive Control Approach to Improve the Reconfiguration Stability of Adaptive Distributed Parallel Applications", "citations": [{"Name": "Sukhpal Singh ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Inderveer Chana", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "46\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "188\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "italy", "university": "university of pisa", "affiliation_string": "university of pisa", "city": "pisa", "Name": "gabriele mencagli"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of pisa", "affiliation_string": "university of pisa", "city": "pisa", "Name": "marco vanneschi"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of pisa", "affiliation_string": "university of pisa", "city": "pisa", "Name": "emanuele vespa"}]}, "Article No.: 3": {"references": ["APERA. 2009.

Approaches exist to filter network-level attacks, but application-level attacks are harder to detect at the firewall. Filtering at this level can be computationally expensive and difficult to scale, while still producing false positives that block legitimate users.This article presents a model-based adaptive architecture and algorithm for detecting DoS attacks at the web application level and mitigating them. Using a performance model to predict the impact of arriving requests, a decision engine adaptively generates rules for filtering traffic and sending suspicious traffic for further review, where the end user is given the opportunity to demonstrate they are a legitimate user. If no legitimate user responds to the challenge, the request is dropped. Experiments performed on a scalable implementation demonstrate effective mitigation of attacks launched using a real-world DoS attack tool.", "authors": [{"name": "cornel barna", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314480924"}, {"name": "mark shtern", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100252037"}, {"name": "michael smit", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332528354"}, {"name": "vassilios tzerpos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100019987"}, {"name": "marin litoiu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409596199"}], "title": "Mitigating DoS Attacks Using Performance Model-Driven Adaptive Algorithms", "citations": [{"Name": "Cornel Barna ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hamoun Ghanbari ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marin Litoiu ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mark Shtern", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "133\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "472\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "mark shtern", "city": null, "Name": "cornel barna"}, {"country": "spain", "university": "ie university", "affiliation_string": "dalhousie university", "city": "segovia", "Name": "michael smit"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "marin litoiu", "city": null, "Name": "vassilios tzerpos"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["Adamic, L.

Our main concern is the design of mechanisms for maximizing cooperation among self-interested agents in a way that their profits increase by exchanging or trading with resources. Although dynamic coalition formation and partner switching (rewiring) have been shown to promote the emergence and maintenance of cooperation for self-interested agents, no prior work in the literature has investigated whether merging both mechanisms exhibits positive synergies that lead to increase cooperation even further. Therefore, we introduce and analyze a novel dynamic coalition formation mechanism, that uses partner switching, to help self-interested agents to increase their profits in a resource exchange environment. Our experiments show the effectiveness of our mechanism at increasing the agents\u2019 profits, as well as the emergence of trading as the preferred behavior over different types of complex networks.", "authors": [{"name": "ana peleteiro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81467666930"}, {"name": "juan c burguillo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100555758"}, {"name": "josep ll arcos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451599887"}, {"name": "juan a rodriguez-aguilar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100419638"}], "title": "Fostering Cooperation through Dynamic Coalition Formation and Partner Switching", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "40\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "306\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of vigo", "city": null, "Name": "ana peleteiro"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of vigo", "city": null, "Name": "juan c burguillo"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "iiia-csic artificial intelligence research institute", "city": null, "Name": "josep ll arcos"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "iiia-csic artificial intelligence research institute", "city": null, "Name": "juan a rodriguez-aguilar"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["R.

The network security and privacy are of great concern today, where self-defense against different kinds of attacks in an autonomous and holistic manner is a challenging topic. To address this problem, we developed an innovative technology called Bionic Autonomic Nervous System (BANS). The BANS is analogous to biological nervous system, which consists of basic modules like cyber axon, cyber neuron, peripheral nerve and central nerve. We also presented an innovative self-defense mechanism which utilizes the Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, and Entropy Awareness, etc. Equipped with the BANS, computer and network systems can intelligently self-defend against both known and unknown compromises/attacks including denial of services (DoS), spyware, malware, and virus. BANS also enabled multiple computers to collaboratively fight against some distributed intelligent attacks like DDoS. We have implemented the BANS in practice.

Rather than downloading a file from a single source, the protocol allows users to join aswarmof peers to download and upload from each other simultaneously. Worms exploiting information from BT servers or trackers can cause serious damage to participating peers, which unfortunately has been neglected previously. In this article, we first present a new worm, calledAdaptive BitTorrent worm(A-BT worm), which finds new victims and propagates sending forged requests to trackers. To reduce its abnormal behavior, the worm estimates the ratio of infected peers and adaptively adjusts its propagation speed. We then build a hybrid model to precisely characterize the propagation behavior of the worm. We also propose a statistical method to automatically detect the worm from the tracker by estimating the variance of the time intervals of requests. To slow down the worm propagation, we design a safe strategy in which the tracker returns secured peers when receives a request. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of the hybrid model, and the effectiveness of our detection method and containment strategy through simulations.", "authors": [{"name": "jiaqing luo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81440609196"}, {"name": "bin xiao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451598173"}, {"name": "qingjun xiao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81440593098"}, {"name": "jiannong cao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451598988"}, {"name": "minyi guo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100085104"}], "title": "Modeling and Defending against Adaptive BitTorrent Worms in Peer-to-Peer Networks", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "55\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "216\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "china", "university": "university of electronic science and technology of china", "affiliation_string": "university of electronic science and technology of china", "city": "chengdu", "Name": "jiaqing luo"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "polytechnic university", "affiliation_string": "hong kong polytechnic university", "city": "sagamihara", "Name": "bin xiao"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "polytechnic university", "affiliation_string": "hong kong polytechnic university", "city": "sagamihara", "Name": "qingjun xiao"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "polytechnic university", "affiliation_string": "hong kong polytechnic university", "city": "sagamihara", "Name": "jiannong cao"}, {"country": "Kyrgyzstan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "shanghai jiao tong university", "city": "tong", "Name": "minyi guo"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2014"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 16": {"references": ["Sunil Adhau , M.

A multitolerant program tolerates multiple classes of faults and provides a potentially different level of fault tolerance to each of them. We consider three levels of fault tolerance, namely failsafe (i.e., satisfy safety in the presence of faults), nonmasking (i.e., recover to legitimate states after the occurrence of faults), and masking (both). For the case where the program is subject to two classes of faults, we consider six categories of multitolerant programs\u2014FF, FN, FM, MM, MN, and NN, where F, N, and M represent failsafe, nonmasking, and masking levels of tolerance provided to each class of fault. We show that the problem of adding FF, NN, and MN multitolerance can be solved in polynomial time (in the state space of the program). However, the problem is NP-complete for adding FN, MM, and FM multitolerance. We note that the hardness of adding MM and FM multitolerance is especially atypical given that MM and FM multitolerance can be added efficiently under more restricted scenarios where multiple faults occur simultaneously in the same computation. We also present heuristics for managing the complexity of MM multitolerance.

Two of Ostrom\u2019s principles are that the resource allocation method should be congruent with the local environment, and that those affected by the allocation method (the appropriators) should participate in its selection. However, these principles do not say anything explicitly about thefairnessof the allocation method or the outcomes it produces: for this, we need a mechanism for distributive justice. Rescher identified a number of different mechanisms, each of which had both its merits and demerits, and instead maintained that distributive justice consisted in identifying the legitimate claims in context, accommodating multiple claims in case of plurality, and reconciling them in case of conflict. Accordingly, we specify a logical axiomatisation of the principles with the canon of legitimate claims, whereby a set of claims is each represented as a voting function, which collectively determine the rank order in which resources are allocated. The appropriators vote on the weight attached to the scoring functions, and so self-organise the allocation method, taking into account both the plurality of and conflict between the claims. Therefore, the appropriators exercise collective choice over the method, and the method itself is congruent with the local environment, taking into account both the resources available and the relative claims of the appropriators. Experiments with a variant of the linear public good game show that this pluralistic self-organising approach produces a better balance of utility and fairness (for agents that comply with the rules of the game) compared to monistic or fixed approaches, provide \u201cfairness over time\u201d (a series of ostensibly unfair individual allocations is revealed to be cumulatively fair), and offer an intuition of how to resolve the free-rider phenomenon in provision and appropriation of common-pool resources.", "authors": [{"name": "jeremy pitt", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81340491827"}, {"name": "didac busquets", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100303991"}, {"name": "sam macbeth", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490690508"}], "title": "Distributive Justice for Self-Organised Common-Pool Resource Management", "citations": [{"Name": "Jeremy Pitt ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alexander Artikis", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "53\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "161\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "imperial college london", "affiliation_string": "imperial college london uk", "city": "london", "Name": "jeremy pitt"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "imperial college london", "affiliation_string": "imperial college london uk", "city": "london", "Name": "didac busquets"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "imperial college london", "affiliation_string": "imperial college london uk", "city": "london", "Name": "sam macbeth"}]}, "Article No.: 12": {"references": ["Sherief Abdallah , Victor Lesser, Multiagent reinforcement learning and self-organization in a network of agents, Proceedings of the 6th international joint conference on Autonomous agents and multiagent systems, May 14-18, 2007, Honolulu, Hawaii[doi>10.1145/1329125.1329172]\n", "Lada A.

Moreover, distributed systems should be able to adapt their structural relations to changes in environmental conditions. In this article, we present a service-oriented multiagent systems, where agents initially self-organize their structural relations based on the similarity of their services. During the service discovery process, agents integrate a mechanism that facilitates the self-organization of their structural relations to adapt the structure of the system to the service demand. This mechanism facilitates the task of decentralized service discovery and improves its performance. Each agent has local knowledge about its direct neighbors and the queries received during discovery processes. With this information, an agent is able to analyze its structural relations and decide when it is more appropriate to modify its direct neighbors and select the most suitable acquaintances to replace them. The experimental evaluation shows how this self-organization mechanism improves the overall performance of the service discovery process in the system when the service demand changes.", "authors": [{"name": "elena del val", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=86159201757"}, {"name": "miguel rebollo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100432955"}, {"name": "mateo vasirani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81321499241"}, {"name": "alberto fernandez", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100386964"}], "title": "Utility-Based Mechanism for Structural Self-Organization in Service-Oriented MAS", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "36\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "144\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Philippines", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universitat politecnica de valencia spain", "city": "valencia", "Name": "elena del val"}, {"country": "Philippines", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universitat politecnica de valencia spain", "city": "valencia", "Name": "miguel rebollo"}, {"country": "france", "university": "ecole polytechnique", "affiliation_string": "ecole polytechnique federale de lausanne lausanne switzerland", "city": "palaiseau", "Name": "mateo vasirani"}, {"country": "spain", "university": "universidad rey juan carlos", "affiliation_string": "universidad rey juan carlos madrid spain", "city": "madrid", "Name": "alberto fernandez"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["A.

However, the traditional approach of using a single cloud has several limitations in terms of availability, avoiding vendor lock-in, and providing legislation-compliant services with suitable Quality of Experience (QoE) to users worldwide. One way for cloud clients to mitigate these issues is to use multiple clouds (i.e., a Multi-Cloud). In this article, we introduce an approach for deploying three-tier applications across multiple clouds in order to satisfy their key nonfunctional requirements. We propose adaptive, dynamic, and reactive resource provisioning and load distribution algorithms that heuristically optimize overall cost and response delays without violating essential legislative and regulatory requirements. Our simulation with realistic workload, network, and cloud characteristics shows that our method improves the state of the art in terms of availability, regulatory compliance, and QoE with acceptable sacrifice in cost and latency.", "authors": [{"name": "nikolay grozev", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81467667699"}, {"name": "rajkumar buyya", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100342317"}], "title": "Multi-Cloud Provisioning and Load Distribution for Three-Tier Applications", "citations": [{"Name": "Sukhpal Singh ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Inderveer Chana", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "192\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "28\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "372\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "australia", "university": "university of melbourne", "affiliation_string": "university of melbourne australia", "city": "melbourne", "Name": "nikolay grozev"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "university of melbourne", "affiliation_string": "university of melbourne australia", "city": "melbourne", "Name": "rajkumar buyya"}]}}, "date": {"month": "October", "year": "2014"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 8": {"references": ["Nigel Davies , Adrian Friday , Stephen P.

In this setting, applications need to communicate with and discover each other using intermediaries that move around the city and transfer data between them. This requires programmers to scatter code that deals with routing messages to the correct place and deal with network failures all over their programs. Our approach allows the programmer to specify urban-area applications in a high-level manner without the burden of directly encoding communication using intermediaries. We present this as a translation from a high-level object-oriented programming paradigm to a low-level communication mechanism.

Resource management is an important and challenging task, especially for multitier applications with unpredictable time-varying workloads. Work in resource management using control theory has shown clear benefits of dynamically adjusting resource allocations to match fluctuating workloads. However, little work has been done toward adaptive controllers for unknown workload types. This work presents a new resource management scheme that incorporates the Kalman filter into feedback controllers to dynamically allocate CPU resources to virtual machines hosting server applications. We present a set of controllers that continuously detect and self-adapt to unforeseen workload changes. Furthermore, our most advanced controller also self-configures itself without anya prioriinformation and with a small 4.8&percnt; performance penalty in the case of high-intensity workload changes. In addition, our controllers are enhanced to deal with multitier server applications: by using the pair-wise resource coupling between tiers, they improve server response to large workload increases as compared to controllers with no such resource-coupling mechanism. Our approaches are evaluated and their performance is illustrated on a 3-tier Rubis benchmark website deployed on a prototype Xen-virtualized cluster.", "authors": [{"name": "evangelia kalyvianaki", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435592943"}, {"name": "themistoklis charalambous", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435607972"}, {"name": "steven hand", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100494265"}], "title": "Adaptive Resource Provisioning for Virtualized Servers Using Kalman Filters", "citations": [{"Name": "Henry Hoffmann", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "79\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "224\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "city university", "affiliation_string": "city university london london uk", "city": "london", "Name": "evangelia kalyvianaki"}, {"country": "Sweden", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "royal institute of technology stockholm sweden", "city": "stockholm", "Name": "themistoklis charalambous"}, {"country": "united states", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research mountain view united states", "city": null, "Name": "steven hand"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Gul Agha, Actors: a model of concurrent computation in distributed systems, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1986\n", "Oana Andrei , H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Kirchner, A Higher-Order Graph Calculus for Autonomic Computing, Graph Theory, Computational Intelligence and Thought: Essays Dedicated to Martin Charles Golumbic on the Occasion of His 60th Birthday, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2009[doi>10.1007/978-3-642-02029-2_2]\n", "Tomoyuki Aotani , Tetsuo Kamina , Hidehiko Masuhara, Featherweight EventCJ: a core calculus for a context-oriented language with event-based per-instance layer transition, Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Context-Oriented Programming, p.1-7, July 25-25, 2011, Lancaster, United Kingdom[doi>10.1145/2068736.2068737]\n", "Malte Appeltauer , Robert Hirschfeld , Michael Haupt , Jens Lincke , Michael Perscheid, A comparison of context-oriented programming languages, International Workshop on Context-Oriented Programming, p.1-6, July 07-07, 2009, Genova, Italy[doi>10.1145/1562112.1562118]\n", "Michael P.

We propose a set of programming abstractions that permit us to represent behaviors, knowledge, and aggregations according to specific policies and to support programming context-awareness, self-awareness, and adaptation. Based on these abstractions, we define SCEL (Software Component Ensemble Language), a kernel language whose solid semantic foundations lay also the basis for formal reasoning on autonomic systems behavior. To show expressiveness and effectiveness of SCEL;\u2019s design, we present a Java implementation of the proposed abstractions and show how it can be exploited for programming a robotics scenario that is used as a running example for describing the features and potential of our approach.", "authors": [{"name": "rocco de nicola", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658615587"}, {"name": "michele loreti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100141622"}, {"name": "rosario pugliese", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100366342"}, {"name": "francesco tiezzi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384613947"}], "title": "A Formal Approach to Autonomic Systems Programming: The SCEL Language", "citations": [{"Name": "Dhaminda B.

Applications of TAS range from online self-optimization of in-production applications to the automatic generation of QoS/cost-driven elastic scaling policies, as well as to support for what-if analysis on the scalability of transactional applications.In this article, we present the key innovation at the core of TAS, namely, a novel performance forecasting methodology that relies on the joint usage of analytical modeling and machine learning. By exploiting these two classically competing approaches in a synergic fashion, TAS achieves the best of the two worlds, namely, high extrapolation power and good accuracy, even when faced with complex workloads deployed over public cloud infrastructures.We demonstrate the accuracy and feasibility of TAS\u2019s performance forecasting methodology via an extensive experimental study based on a fully fledged prototype implementation integrated with a popular open-source in-memory transactional data grid (Red Hat\u2019s Infinispan) and industry-standard benchmarks generating a breadth of heterogeneous workloads.", "authors": [{"name": "diego didona", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490690989"}, {"name": "paolo romano", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81491640501"}, {"name": "sebastiano peluso", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490690657"}, {"name": "francesco quaglia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100097119"}], "title": "Transactional Auto Scaler: Elastic Scaling of Replicated In-Memory Transactional Data Grids", "citations": [{"Name": "Diego Didona ", "Country": "oman", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Paolo Romano", "Country": "oman", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sukhpal Singh ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Inderveer Chana", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "57\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "153\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "portugal", "university": "universidade de lisboa", "affiliation_string": "inesc-idinstituto superior tecnico universidade de lisboa lisbon portugal", "city": "lisbon", "Name": "diego didona"}, {"country": "portugal", "university": "universidade de lisboa", "affiliation_string": "inesc-idinstituto superior tecnico universidade de lisboa lisbon portugal", "city": "lisbon", "Name": "paolo romano"}, {"country": "portugal", "university": "universidade de lisboa", "affiliation_string": "sapienza universita di romainstituto superior tecnico universidade de lisboa rome italy", "city": "lisbon", "Name": "sebastiano peluso"}, {"country": "Italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "sapienza universita di roma rome italy", "city": "rome", "Name": "francesco quaglia"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2628613", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "jose luis fernandez-marquez", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81486642337"}, {"name": "mirko viroli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82258853257"}, {"name": "gabriella castelli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331489727"}], "title": "Best ACM SAC Articles on Coordination and Self-Adaptation", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "20\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "162\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "mirko viroli", "city": null, "Name": "jose luis fernandez-marquez"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["Rajeev Alur , Mihalis Yannakakis, Model Checking of Message Sequence Charts, Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Concurrency Theory, p.114-129, August 24-27, 1999\n", "Paul Ammann , Jeff Offutt, Introduction to Software Testing, Cambridge University Press, New York, NY, 2008\n", "James H.

Not surprisingly, many agent-oriented software development methods have been proposed, including GAIA, PASSI, andTropos. This paper extends theTroposmethodology, enhancing its ability to support high variability design through the explicit modelling of alternatives, it adopts an extended notion of agent capability and proposes a refinedTroposdesign process. The paper also presents an implemented software development environment forTropos, founded on the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) framework and standards.

For over a decade, the FIPA standards activity has worked to produce public MAS specifications, acting as a key enabler to support interoperability, open service interaction, and to support heterogeneous development. The main characteristics of the FIPA model for MAS and an analysis of design, design choices and features of the model is presented.

In fact, Grid computing and multi-agent systems research have similar objectives. They both aim to achieve \u201clarge-scale open distributed systems, capable of being able to effectively and dynamically deploy and redeploy computational (and other) resources as required, to solve computationally complex problems\u201d [Foster and Kesselman 2003]. On the one hand, service-oriented Grid architectures need to support dynamic cooperation, negotiation, and adaptive interactions between Web services controlling Grid resources for efficient resource and task allocation and execution. On the other hand, the Grid can facilitate agent communication, life-cycle management, and access to resources for agents. Although the relevance of Grid for agent research and vice versa has been identified in several forums, actual collaborative applications are still in their infancy. In this article, we discuss our recent work on deploying multi-agent negotiation techniques to facilitate dynamic negotiation for Grid resources as a step closer to an adaptive and autonomous Grid. In particular, we describe a Web service development of the Contract Net Protocol for negotiation between insurance companies and repair companies. We evaluate our approach to show the added value of negotiable interactions between Web services as opposed to inflexible single-shot interactions that are currently the state of the art.", "authors": [{"name": "shamimabi paurobally", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100558301"}, {"name": "valentina tamma", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100202348"}, {"name": "michael wooldrdige", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100253812"}], "title": "A Framework for Web service negotiation", "citations": [{"Name": "Amelia B\u0103dic\u0103 ", "Country": "poland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Costin B\u0103dic\u0103 ", "Country": "poland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sorin Ilie ", "Country": "poland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alex Muscar ", "Country": "poland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mihnea Scafe\u015f", "Country": "poland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dynamic selection of negotiation protocol in multi-agent systems for disaster management", "Country": "poland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Karuna P.

The techniques used are hybrid in nature, making use of performance evaluation and linear and nonlinear programming models. The workloads are characterized by theworkload intensity, which represents the total number of users in the system, and by theworkload mixes, which depict the number of users in each class of service. The results presented in this article can be applied to distributed transactional systems. Such systems serve a large number of users with many classes of services and can thus be considered as representative of a large class of autonomic computing systems.", "authors": [{"name": "marin litoiu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409596199"}], "title": "A performance analysis method for autonomic computing systems", "citations": [{"Name": "D.

One problem of the present VoIP networks is filtering spam calls referred to as SPIT (Spam over Internet Telephony). Unlike spam in e-mail systems, VoIP spam calls have to be identified in real time. Many of the techniques devised for e-mail spam detection rely upon content analysis, and in the case of VoIP, it is too late to analyze the content (voice) as the user would have already attended the call. Therefore, the real challenge is to block a spam call before the telephone rings. In addition, we believe it is imperative that spam filters integrate human behavioral aspects to gauge the legitimacy of voice calls. We know that, when it comes to receiving or rejecting a voice call, people use the social meaning of trust, reputation, friendship of the calling party and their own mood. In this article, we describe a multi-stage, adaptive spam filter based on presence (location, mood, time), trust, and reputation to detect spam in voice calls. In particular, we describe a closed-loop feedback control between different stages to decide whether an incoming call is spam. We further propose formalism for voice-specific trust and reputation analysis. We base this formal model on a human intuitive behavior for detecting spam based on the called party's direct and indirect relationships with the calling party. No VoIP corpus is available for testing the detection mechanism. Therefore, for verifying the detection accuracy, we used a laboratory setup of several soft-phones, real IP phones and a commercial-grade proxy server that receives and processes incoming calls. We experimentally validated the proposed filtering mechanisms by simulating spam calls and measured the filter's accuracy by applying the trust and reputation formalism. We observed that, while the filter blocks a second spam call from a spammer calling from the same end IP host and domain, the filter needs only a maximum of three calls---even in the case when spammer moves to a new host and domain. Finally, we present a detailed sensitivity analysis for examining the influence of parameters such as spam volume and network size on the filter's accuracy.", "authors": [{"name": "prakash kolan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100351754"}, {"name": "ram dantu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81326488587"}], "title": "Socio-technical defense against voice spamming", "citations": [{"Name": "Tobias Jung ", "Country": "luxembourg", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sylvain Martin ", "Country": "luxembourg", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Damien Ernst ", "Country": "luxembourg", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Guy Leduc", "Country": "luxembourg", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Adam J.

This has left many researchers confused as to what constitutes a self-organizing distributed system and without a vocabulary with which to discuss aspects of these systems. This article introduces an agent-based model of self-organizing MANET and P2P systems and shows how it is realised in three existing network systems. The model is based on concepts such as partial views, evaluation functions, system utility, feedback and decay. We review the three network systems, AntHocNet, SAMPLE, and Freenet, and show how they can achieve high scalability, robustness and adaptability to unpredictable changes in their environment, by using self-organizing mechanisms similar to those found in nature. They are designed to improve their operation in a dynamic, heterogeneous environment, enabling them to often demonstrate superior performance to state of the art distributed systems.

It is difficult, maybe impossible for a peer to perceive the membership and location of every resource object due to the scalability and openness of a P2P network. In this article, we discuss a fully distributed P2P system where there is no centralized controller. Each peer has to obtain service information from its acquaintance peers and also send its service information to the acquaintance peers. An acquaintance peer of a peerpis a peer about whose service the peerpknows and with which the peerpcan directly communicate in an overlay network. Some acquaintance peer might hold obsolete service information and might be faulty. Each peer has to find a more trustworthy one among acquaintance peers. There are many discussions on how to detect peers that hold a target object. However, a peer cannot manipulate an object without being granted access rights (permissions). In addition to detecting what peers hold a target object, we have to find peers granted access rights to manipulate the target object. The trustworthiness of each acquaintance is defined in terms of the satisfiability and ranking factor in this article. The satisfiability of an acquaintance peer shows how much each peer can trust the acquaintance peer through direct communication to not only detect target objects but also obtain their access rights. On the other hand, the ranking factor of an acquaintance peer indicates how much the acquaintance peer is trusted only by trustworthy acquaintance peers which is different from the traditional reputation concept. We evaluate how the trustworthiness of an acquaintance peer is changed through interactions among peers in a detection algorithm.", "authors": [{"name": "kenichi watanabe", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100363480"}, {"name": "yoshio nakajima", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81312483490"}, {"name": "tomoya enokido", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100255772"}, {"name": "makoto takizawa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100072045"}], "title": "Ranking factors in peer-to-peer overlay networks", "citations": [{"Name": "Yi Liu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shinji Sakamoto ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Keita Matsuo ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Makoto Ikeda ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Leonard Barolli", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Evjola Spaho ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shinji Sakamoto ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Leonard Barolli ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fatos Xhafa ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Makoto Ikeda", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Matthias H\u00f6lzl ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Axel Rauschmayer ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Martin Wirsing", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Engineering of Software-Intensive Systems: State of the Art and Research Challenges", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "21\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "634\n", "Citation Count": "11\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "japan", "university": "tokyo denki university", "affiliation_string": "tokyo denki university hiki saitama japan", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "kenichi watanabe"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "tokyo denki university", "affiliation_string": "tokyo denki university hiki saitama japan", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "yoshio nakajima"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "rissho university", "affiliation_string": "rissho university tokyo japan", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "tomoya enokido"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "tokyo denki university", "affiliation_string": "tokyo denki university hiki saitama japan", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "makoto takizawa"}]}, "Article No.: 8": {"references": ["Yi-an Huang , Wenke Lee, A cooperative intrusion detection system for ad hoc networks, Proceedings of the 1st ACM workshop on Security of ad hoc and sensor networks, October 31, 2003, Fairfax, Virginia[doi>10.1145/986858.986877]\n", "Sonja Buchegger , Jean-Yves Le Boudec, Performance analysis of the CONFIDANT protocol, Proceedings of the 3rd ACM international symposium on Mobile ad hoc networking & computing, June 09-11, 2002, Lausanne, Switzerland[doi>10.1145/513800.513828]\n", "Michel Diaz , Guy Juanole , Jean-Pierre Courtiat, Observer-A Concept for Formal On-Line Validation of Distributed Systems, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, v.20 n.12, p.900-913, December 1994[doi>10.1109/32.368136]\n", "Shlomi Dolev , Amos Israeli , Shlomo Moran, Uniform Dynamic Self-Stabilizing Leader Election, IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, v.8 n.4, p.424-440, April 1997[doi>10.1109/71.588622]\n", "Emmerich, S. 1996.

The developers of WSNs can specify \u201cinvariants\u201d that must be satisfied by the WSNs. We present a framework, Hierarchical SEnsor Network Debugging (H-SEND), for lightweight checking of invariants. H-SEND is able to detect a large class of faults in data-gathering WSNs, and leverages the existing message flow in the network by buffering and piggybacking messages. H-SEND checks as closely to the source of a fault as possible, pinpointing the fault quickly and efficiently in terms of additional network traffic. Therefore, H-SEND is suited to bandwidth or communication energy constrained networks. A specification expression is provided for specifying invariants so that a protocol developer can write behavioral level invariants. We hypothesize that data from sensor nodes does not change dramatically, but rather changes gradually over time. We extend our framework for the invariants that includes values determined at run-time in order to detect data trends. The value range can be based on information local to a single node or the surrounding nodes' values. Using our system, developers can write invariants to detect data trends without prior knowledge of correct values. Automatic value detection can be used to detect anomalies that cannot be detected in existing WSNs. To demonstrate the benefits of run-time range detection and fault checking, we construct a prototype WSN using CO2and temperature sensors coupled to Mica2 motes. We show that our method can detect sudden changes of the environments with little overhead in communication, computation, and storage.", "authors": [{"name": "douglas herbert", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314489772"}, {"name": "vinaitheerthan sundaram", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367591309"}, {"name": "yung-hsiang lu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100054097"}, {"name": "saurabh bagchi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100213708"}, {"name": "zhiyuan li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409597718"}], "title": "Adaptive correctness monitoring for wireless sensor networks using hierarchical distributed run-time invariant checking", "citations": [{"Name": "Yafeng Wu ", "Country": "sweden", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Krasimira Kapitanova ", "Country": "sweden", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jingyuan Li ", "Country": "sweden", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "John A.

Therefore, systems built of these dynamic entities must be runtime reconfigurable. In addition, large classes of open embedded systems often have high availability and dependability requirements. However, the openness makes these requirements more difficult to achieve and the system more vulnerable to attacks.This article presents a coordination model, the Actor, Role and Coordinator (ARC) model, that aims to support reconfigurability and fault localization for open distributed embedded software systems. In particular, the actor model is used to model concurrent embedded entities, while the system's reconfigurability and dependability requirements are encapsulated within coordination objects: roles and coordinators, and are achieved through coordination among the actors. Roles, as a key thrust in the ARC model not only represent an abstraction for a set of behaviors shared by a group of actors so that reconfiguration within the roles becomes transparent to entities outside the roles, but also assume coordination responsibilities among the member actors. The article also argues from both analytical and empirical perspectives that with the support of the role, faults can be localized within actors, and actor level reconfiguration becomes transparent to the system.", "authors": [{"name": "shangping ren", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319500435"}, {"name": "yue yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81321500454"}, {"name": "nianen chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319489989"}, {"name": "jeffrey j-p tsai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350591654"}, {"name": "kevin kwiat", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100059011"}], "title": "The role of roles in supporting reconfigurability and fault localizations for open distributed and embedded systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Matthias H\u00f6lzl ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Axel Rauschmayer ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Martin Wirsing", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Engineering of Software-Intensive Systems: State of the Art and Research Challenges", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "15\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "551\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "illinois institute of technology chicago il", "city": "chicago", "Name": "shangping ren"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "illinois institute of technology chicago il", "city": "chicago", "Name": "yue yu"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "illinois institute of technology chicago il", "city": "chicago", "Name": "nianen chen"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of illinois at chicago chicago il", "city": "chicago", "Name": "jeffrey j-p tsai"}, {"country": "Italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "air force research laboratory rome ny", "city": "rome", "Name": "kevin kwiat"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/1278460.1278461", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "jeffrey j p tsai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409592968"}, {"name": "mukesh singhal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81337493538"}], "title": "Introduction: Special issue of the IEEE SUTC'06", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "7\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "342\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "mukesh singhal", "city": null, "Name": "jeffrey j p tsai"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["Anderson, D., Frivold, T., and Valdes, A. 1995.

In this article, a distributed multiagent intrusion detection system (IDS) architecture is proposed, which attempts to provide an accurate and lightweight solution to network intrusion detection by tackling issues associated with the design of a distributed multiagent system, such as poor system scalability and the requirements of excessive processing power and memory storage. The proposed IDS architecture consists of (i) the Host layer with lightweight host agents that perform anomaly detection in network connections to their respective hosts, and (ii) the Classification layer whose main functions are to perform misuse detection for the host agents, detect distributed attacks, and disseminate network security status information to the whole network. The intrusion detection task is achieved through the employment of the lightweight Adaptive Sub-Eigenspace Modeling (ASEM)-based anomaly and misuse detection schemes. Promising experimental results indicate that ASEM-based schemes outperform the KNN and LOF algorithms, with high detection rates and low false alarm rates in the anomaly detection task, and outperform several well-known supervised classification methods such as C4.5 Decision Tree, SVM, NN, KNN, Logistic, and Decision Table (DT) in the misuse detection task. To assess the performance in a real-world scenario, the Relative Assumption Model, feature extraction techniques, and common network attack generation tools are employed to generate normal and anomalous traffic in a private LAN testbed. Furthermore, the scalability performance of the proposed IDS architecture is investigated through the simulation of the proposed agent communication scheme, and satisfactory linear relationships for both degradation of system response time and agent communication generated network traffic overhead are achieved.", "authors": [{"name": "mei-ling shyu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100515364"}, {"name": "thiago quirino", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314491406"}, {"name": "zongxing xie", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314493020"}, {"name": "shu-ching chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351593903"}, {"name": "liwu chang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100246774"}], "title": "Network intrusion detection through Adaptive Sub-Eigenspace Modeling in multiagent systems", "citations": [{"Name": "E.

Existing representative checkpoint selection strategies often select some unnecessary checkpoints and omit some necessary ones because they cannot adapt to the dynamics and uncertainty of runtime activity completion duration. In this article, based on the dynamics and uncertainty of runtime activity completion duration, we develop a novel checkpoint selection strategy that can adaptively select not only necessary, but also sufficient checkpoints. Specifically, we introduce a new concept of minimum time redundancy as a key reference parameter for checkpoint selection. An important feature of minimum time redundancy is that it can adapt to the dynamics and uncertainty of runtime activity completion duration. We develop a method on how to achieve minimum time redundancy dynamically along grid workflow execution and investigate its relationships with temporal consistency. Based on the method and the relationships, we present our strategy and rigorously prove its necessity and sufficiency. The simulation evaluation further demonstrates experimentally such necessity and sufficiency and its significant improvement on checkpoint selection over other representative strategies.", "authors": [{"name": "jinjun chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452604018"}, {"name": "yun yang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81408599231"}], "title": "Adaptive selection of necessary and sufficient checkpoints for dynamic verification of temporal constraints in grid workflow systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Xiao Liu ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yun Yang ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jinjun Chen ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Qing Wang ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mingshu Li", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Achieving On-Time Delivery: A Two-Stage Probabilistic Scheduling Strategy for Software Projects", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Proceedings of the International Conference on Software Process: Trustworthy Software Development Processes", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "May 16-17", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "2009", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Vancouver", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "B.

We exemplify and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach via an application for object-tracking. This application allows robots and humans to find forgotten-somewhere objects by following pheromones trails associated with them.

However, most existing models are adapted from biological epidemic ones. Although biological epidemic models can certainly be adapted to capture some computer virus spreading scenarios (especially when the so-called homogeneity assumption holds), the problem of computer virus spreading is not well understood because it has many important perspectives that are not necessarily accommodated in the biological epidemic models. In this article, we initiate the study of such a perspective, namely that ofadaptivedefense against epidemic spreading in arbitrary networks. More specifically, we investigate a nonhomogeneous Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) model where the model parameters may vary with respect to time. In particular, we focus on two scenarios we callsemi-adaptivedefense andfully adaptivedefense, which accommodate implicit and explicit dependency relationships between the model parameters, respectively. In the semi-adaptive defense scenario, the model\u2019s input parameters are given; the defense is semi-adaptive because the adjustment is implicitly dependent upon the outcome of virus spreading. For this scenario, we present a set of sufficient conditions (some are more general or succinct than others) under which the virus spreading will die out; such sufficient conditions are also known asepidemic thresholdsin the literature. In the fully adaptive defense scenario, some input parameters are not known (i.e., the aforementioned sufficient conditions are not applicable) but the defender can observe the outcome of virus spreading. For this scenario, we present adaptive control strategies under which the virus spreading will die out or will be contained to a desired level.", "authors": [{"name": "shouhuai xu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100195423"}, {"name": "wenlian lu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548650856"}, {"name": "li xu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81549498456"}, {"name": "zhenxin zhan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474643333"}], "title": "Adaptive Epidemic Dynamics in Networks: Thresholds and Control", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "63\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "195\n", "Citation Count": "5\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Mali", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of texas at san antonio", "city": "san", "Name": "shouhuai xu"}, {"country": "china", "university": "fudan university", "affiliation_string": "fudan university", "city": "shanghai", "Name": "wenlian lu"}, {"country": "Mali", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of texas at san antonio", "city": "san", "Name": "li xu"}, {"country": "Mali", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of texas at san antonio", "city": "san", "Name": "zhenxin zhan"}]}, "Article No.: 18": {"references": ["Mehdi Amoui , Mahdi Derakhshanmanesh , J\u00fcRgen Ebert , Ladan Tahvildari, Achieving dynamic adaptation via management and interpretation of runtime models, Journal of Systems and Software, v.85 n.12, p.2720-2737, December, 2012[doi>10.1016/j.jss.2012.05.033]\n", "Jesper Andersson , Rogerio de Lemos , Sam Malek , Danny Weyns, Reflecting on self-adaptive software systems, Proceedings of the 2009 ICSE Workshop on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems, p.38-47, May 18-19, 2009[doi>10.1109/SEAMS.2009.5069072]\n", "Andersson, J., Baresi, L., Bencomo, N., de Lemos, R., Gorla, A., Inverardi, P., and Vogel, T. 2013.

The engine often describes the adaptation by runtime models representing the adaptable software and by activities such as analysis and planning that use these models. To systematically address the interplay between runtime models and adaptation activities,runtime megamodelshave been proposed. A runtime megamodel is a specific model capturing runtime models and adaptation activities. In this article, we go one step further and present an executable modeling language forExecUtable RuntimE MegAmodels(EUREMA) that eases the development of adaptation engines by following a model-driven engineering approach. We provide a domain-specific modeling language and a runtime interpreter for adaptation engines, in particular feedback loops. Megamodels are kept alive at runtime and by interpreting them, they are directly executed to run feedback loops. Additionally, they can be dynamically adjusted to adapt feedback loops. Thus, EUREMA supports development by making feedback loops explicit at a higher level of abstraction and it enables solutions where multiple feedback loops interact or operate on top of each other and self-adaptation co-exists with offline adaptation for evolution.", "authors": [{"name": "thomas vogel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435606323"}, {"name": "holger giese", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100178623"}], "title": "Model-Driven Engineering of Self-Adaptive Software with EUREMA", "citations": [{"Name": "M.

Criticalities are consequences of events which take a system (in our case, a smart infrastructure) into an unstable state. They require the execution of specificresponse actionsin order to bring them under control. The principal aim of CAAC is to grant the right set of access privileges (to facilitate response action execution), at the right time, to the right set of subjects, for the right duration, in order to control the criticalities within the system. In this regard, the CAAC model uses a stochastic model called theAction Generation Modelto determine the required response actions for the combination of criticalities present within the system. It then facilitates response actions byadaptivelyaltering the privileges to specific subjects, in aproactivemanner, without the need for any explicit access requests. In this article, we formalize the CAAC model and validate it based on twodesign goals- proactivity and adaptiveness. Finally, we present a case study demonstrating CAAC\u2019s operation on an oil-rig platform in order to aid in the response to health- and fire-related criticalities.", "authors": [{"name": "krishna k venkatasubramanian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310485169"}, {"name": "tridib mukherjee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81508702225"}, {"name": "sandeep k s gupta", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452612965"}], "title": "CAAC -- An Adaptive and Proactive Access Control Approach for Emergencies in Smart Infrastructures", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "63\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "11\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "357\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "arizona state university", "city": null, "Name": "krishna k venkatasubramanian"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "arizona state university", "city": null, "Name": "tridib mukherjee"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "arizona state university", "city": null, "Name": "sandeep k s gupta"}]}, "Article No.: 16": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2555610", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "luciano baresi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100467886"}, {"name": "hausi muller", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81335494840"}], "title": "Introduction to the Special Section on Best Papers from SEAMS 2012", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "8\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "94\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "politecnico di milano italy", "city": null, "Name": "luciano baresi"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of victoria", "affiliation_string": "university of victoria canada", "city": "victoria", "Name": "hausi muller"}]}, "Article No.: 17": {"references": ["Abie, H. 2009.

They are growing in importance, as the stovepipe static methods of securing software systems have been shown to be inadequate for the challenges posed by modern software systems. Self-protection, like other self-* properties, allows the system to adapt to the changing environment through autonomic means without much human intervention, and can thereby be responsive, agile, and cost effective. While existing research has made significant progress towards autonomic and adaptive security, gaps and challenges remain. This article presents a significant extension of our preliminary study in this area. In particular, unlike our preliminary study, here we have followed a systematic literature review process, which has broadened the scope of our study and strengthened the validity of our conclusions. By proposing and applying a comprehensive taxonomy to classify and characterize the state-of-the-art research in this area, we have identified key patterns, trends and challenges in the existing approaches, which reveals a number of opportunities that will shape the focus of future research efforts.", "authors": [{"name": "eric yuan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100116433"}, {"name": "naeem esfahani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436602167"}, {"name": "sam malek", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100267865"}], "title": "A Systematic Survey of Self-Protecting Software Systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Amel Bennaceur ", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Arosha K.

In this article, we present WormTerminator, a host-based solution for fast Internet worm detection and containment with the assistance of virtual machine techniques based on the fast-worm defining characteristic. In WormTerminator, a virtual machine cloning the host OS runs in parallel to the host OS. Thus, the virtual machine has the same set of vulnerabilities as the host. Any outgoing traffic from the host is diverted through the virtual machine. If the outgoing traffic from the host is for fast worm propagation, the virtual machine should be infected and will exhibit worm propagation pattern very quickly because a fast-spreading worm will start to propagate as soon as it successfully infects a host. To prove the concept, we have implemented a prototype of WormTerminator and have examined its effectiveness against the real Internet worm Linux/Slapper. Our empirical results confirm that WormTerminator is able to completely contain worm propagation in real-time without blocking any non-worm traffic. The major performance cost of WormTerminator is a one-time delay to the start of each outgoing normal connection for worm detection. To reduce the performance overhead, caching is utilized, through which WormTerminator will delay no more than 6&percnt; normal outgoing traffic for such detection on average.", "authors": [{"name": "songqing chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350588812"}, {"name": "lei liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87259073657"}, {"name": "xinyuan wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87259408757"}, {"name": "xinwen zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87259309457"}, {"name": "zhao zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100116187"}], "title": "A Host-Based Approach for Unknown Fast-Spreading Worm Detection and Containment", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "40\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "136\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "george mason university", "city": null, "Name": "songqing chen"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "george mason university", "city": null, "Name": "lei liu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "george mason university", "city": null, "Name": "xinyuan wang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "samsung information systems america", "city": null, "Name": "xinwen zhang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "iowa state university", "city": null, "Name": "zhao zhang"}]}}, "date": {"month": "January", "year": "2014"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Baras, J.

Such algorithms are inspired by the foraging behavior of ants in nature. We consider an ARA algorithm proposed earlier by Bean and Costa [2005]. The algorithm has the virtues of being adaptive and distributed, and can provide a multipath routing solution. We consider a scenario where there are multiple incoming data traffic streams that are to be routed to their respective destinations via the network. Ant packets, which are nothing but probe packets, are introduced to estimate the path delays in the network. The node routing tables, which consist of routing probabilities for the outgoing links, are updated based on these delay estimates. In contrast to the available analytical studies in the literature, the link delays in our model are stochastic, time-varying, and dependent on the link traffic. The evolution of the delay estimates and the routing probabilities are described by a set of stochastic iterative equations. In doing so, we take into account the distributed and asynchronous nature of the algorithm operation. Using methods from the theory of stochastic approximations, we show that the evolution of the delay estimates can be closely tracked by a deterministic ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation) system, when the step size of the delay estimation scheme is small. We study the equilibrium behavior of the ODE system in order to obtain the equilibrium behavior of the routing algorithm. We also explore properties of the equilibrium routing probabilities, and provide illustrative simulation results.", "authors": [{"name": "punyaslok purkayastha", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435597314"}, {"name": "john s baras", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100067511"}], "title": "Convergence results for ant routing algorithms via stochastic approximation", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "32\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "208\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland college park md", "city": null, "Name": "punyaslok purkayastha"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland college park md", "city": null, "Name": "john s baras"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Albert, R., Jeong, H., and Barabasi, A.

Our previous work has shown that reaching 100&percnt; agreement is not as straighforward as assumed by previous researchers, that, in order to save computational resources fixed the convergence rate to 90&percnt; (measuring the time it takes for 90&percnt; of the population to coordinate on the same action). In this article we present the notion of social instruments as a set of mechanisms that facilitate and accelerate the emergence of norms from repeated interactions between members of a society, only accessing local and public information and thus ensuring agents' privacy and anonymity. Specifically, we focus on two social instruments: rewiring and observation. Our main goal is to provide agents with tools that allow them to leverage their social network of interactions while effectively addressing coordination and learning problems, paying special attention to dissolving metastable subconventions.The first experimental results show that even with the usage of the proposed instruments, convergence is not accelerated or even obtained in irregular networks. This result leads us to perform an exhaustive analysis of irregular networks discovering what we have defined asSelf-Reinforcing Structures(SRS). The SRS are topological configurations of nodes that promote the establishment and persistence of subconventions by producing a continuous reinforcing effect on the frontier agents. Finally, we propose a more sophisticated composed social instrument (observation &plus; rewiring) for robust resolution ofsubconventions, which works by the dissolution of the stable frontiers caused by the Self-Reinforcing Substructures (SRS) within the social network.", "authors": [{"name": "daniel villatoro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436594336"}, {"name": "jordi sabater-mir", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81341496047"}, {"name": "sandip sen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81556846356"}], "title": "Robust convention emergence in social networks through self-reinforcing structures dissolution", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "24\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "212\n", "Citation Count": "4\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Aruba", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "iiia - csic barcelona spain", "city": "barcelona", "Name": "daniel villatoro"}, {"country": "Aruba", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "iiia - csic barcelona spain", "city": "barcelona", "Name": "jordi sabater-mir"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of tulsa tulsa ok", "city": "tulsa", "Name": "sandip sen"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2451248.2451249", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "manish parashar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81558391256"}, {"name": "franco zambonelli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100268981"}], "title": "Editorial", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "12\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "279\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "rutgers university", "city": null, "Name": "manish parashar"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of modena", "affiliation_string": "university of modena e reggio emilia", "city": "modena", "Name": "franco zambonelli"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Adidas_1. 2005.

The proposed approach samples, estimates, and builds the model of pertinent and important aspects of the network environment such as type of traffic, QoS policies, resources, etc. It is based on the trial/error paradigm combined with swarm-adaptive approaches. The global system uses a model that combines both a stochastic planned prenavigation for the exploration phase with a deterministic approach for the backward phase. We conducted a performance analysis of the proposed algorithm using OPNET based on several topologies such as the Nippon telephone and telegraph network. The simulation results obtained demonstrate substantial performance improvements over traditional routing approaches as well as the benefits of learning approaches for networks with dynamically changing traffic.", "authors": [{"name": "abdelhamid mellouk", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330495621"}, {"name": "said hoceini", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309497022"}, {"name": "sherali zeadally", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100139634"}], "title": "A state-dependent time evolving multi-constraint routing algorithm", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "32\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "243\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "said hoceini", "city": null, "Name": "abdelhamid mellouk"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of the district of columbia us", "city": "columbia", "Name": "sherali zeadally"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Abramowitz, M. and Stegun, I. 1972.

In recent years, the focus of optimization within scientific workflows has primarily been on computational tasks and workflow makespan. However, as workflow-based analysis becomes ever more data intensive, data optimization is becoming a prime concern. Moreover, scientific workflows can scale along several dimensions: (i) number of computational tasks, (ii) heterogeneity of computational resources, and the (iii) size and type (static versus streamed) of data involved. Adapting workflow structure in response to these scalability challenges remains an important research objective. Understanding how a workflow graph can be restructured in an automated manner (through task merge, for instance), to address constraints of a particular execution environment is explored in this work, using a multi-objective evolutionary approach. Our approach attempts to adapt the workflow structure to achieve both compute and data optimization. The question of when to terminate the evolutionary search in order to conserve computations is tackled with a novel termination criterion. The results presented in this article demonstrate the feasibility of the termination criterion and demonstrate that significant optimization can be achieved with a multi-objective approach.", "authors": [{"name": "irfan habib", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548038668"}, {"name": "ashiq anjum", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100325609"}, {"name": "richard mcclatchey", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100309077"}, {"name": "omer rana", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81556977656"}], "title": "Adapting scientific workflow structures using multi-objective optimization strategies", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "44\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "282\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Cameroon", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "fet university of the west of england uk", "city": "west", "Name": "irfan habib"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of derby", "affiliation_string": "university of derby derby uk", "city": "derby", "Name": "ashiq anjum"}, {"country": "Cameroon", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "fet university of the west of england uk", "city": "west", "Name": "richard mcclatchey"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "cardiff university", "affiliation_string": "cardiff university uk", "city": "cardiff", "Name": "omer rana"}]}}, "date": {"month": "April", "year": "2013"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 15": {"references": ["Allison, P.

We study the problem of coordinating on socially optimal outcomes among a population of agents, in which each agent randomly interacts with another agent from the population each round. Previous work [Hales and Edmonds 2003; Matlock and Sen 2007, 2009] mainly resorts to modifying the interaction protocol from random interaction to tag-based interactions and only focus on the case of symmetric games. Besides, in previous work the agents\u2019 decision making processes are usually based on evolutionary learning, which usually results in high communication cost and high deviation on the coordination rate. To solve these problems, we propose an alternative social learning framework with two major contributions as follows. First, we introduce theobservationmechanism to reduce the amount of communication required among agents. Second, we propose that the agents\u2019 learning strategies should be based on reinforcement learning technique instead of evolutionary learning. Each agent explicitly keeps the record of its current state in its learning strategy, and learn its optimal policy for each state independently. In this way, the learning performance is much more stable and also it is suitable for both symmetric and asymmetric games. The performance of this social learning framework is extensively evaluated under the testbed of two-player general-sum games comparing with previous work [Hao and Leung 2011; Matlock and Sen 2007]. The influences of different factors on the learning performance of the social learning framework are investigated as well.", "authors": [{"name": "jianye hao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81551206356"}, {"name": "ho-fung leung", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83059057157"}], "title": "Achieving Socially Optimal Outcomes in Multiagent Systems with Reinforcement Social Learning", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "49\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "249\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "hong kong", "university": "university of hong kong", "affiliation_string": "the chinese university of hong kong", "city": "xianggangdao", "Name": "jianye hao"}, {"country": "hong kong", "university": "university of hong kong", "affiliation_string": "the chinese university of hong kong", "city": "xianggangdao", "Name": "ho-fung leung"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Apache. 2010.

An increasing number of these applications have additional requirements for completion time guarantees. In this article, we consider the popular Pig framework that provides a high-level SQL-like abstraction on top of MapReduce engine for processing large data sets. There is a lack of performance models and analysis tools for automated performance management of such MapReduce jobs. We offer a performance modeling environment for Pig programs that automatically profiles jobs from the past runs and aims to solve the following inter-related problems: (i) estimating the completion time of a Pig program as a function of allocated resources; (ii) estimating the amount of resources (a number of map and reduce slots) required for completing a Pig program with a given (soft) deadline. First, we design abasicperformance model that accurately predicts completion time and required resource allocation for a Pig program that is defined as a sequence of MapReduce jobs: predicted completion times are within 10&percnt; of the measured ones. Second, we optimize a Pig program execution by enforcing theoptimal scheduleof its concurrent jobs. For DAGs with concurrent jobs, this optimization helps reducing the program completion time: 10&percnt;--27&percnt; in our experiments. Moreover, it eliminates possible nondeterminism of concurrent jobs\u2019 execution in the Pig program, and therefore, enables a more accurate performance model for Pig programs. Third, based on these optimizations, we propose arefinedperformance model for Pig programs with concurrent jobs. The proposed approach leads to significant resource savings (20&percnt;--60&percnt; in our experiments) compared with the original, unoptimized solution. We validate our solution using a 66-node Hadoop cluster and a diverse set of workloads: PigMix benchmark, TPC-H queries, and customized queries mining a collection of HP Labs\u2019 web proxy logs.", "authors": [{"name": "zhuoyao zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81472640701"}, {"name": "ludmila cherkasova", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548020076"}, {"name": "abhishek verma", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81486652687"}, {"name": "boon thau loo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100594279"}], "title": "Performance Modeling and Optimization of Deadline-Driven Pig Programs", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "73\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "289\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "hp labs and university of pennsylvania", "city": null, "Name": "zhuoyao zhang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "hewlett-packard labs", "city": null, "Name": "ludmila cherkasova"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "hp labs and university of illinois at urbana-champaign", "city": null, "Name": "abhishek verma"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of pennsylvania", "city": null, "Name": "boon thau loo"}]}, "Article No.: 12": {"references": ["Alba, J. and Chattopadhyay, A. 1985.

They will be required to act in a vast information landscape, asserting the relevance of data spread in the cyber world, in order to let their human users become aware of the content they really need. This is a remarkably similar situation to what the human brain has to do all the time when deciding what information coming from the surrounding environment is interesting and what can simply be ignored. The brain performs this task using so called cognitive heuristics, i.e. simple, rapid, yet very effective schemes. In this article, we propose a new approach that exploits one of these heuristics, therecognition heuristic, for developing a self-adaptive system that deals with effective data dissemination in opportunistic networks. We show how to implement it and provide an extensive analysis via simulation. Specifically, results show that the proposed solution is as effective as state-of-the-art solutions for data dissemination in opportunistic networks, while requiring far less resources. Finally, our sensitiveness analysis shows how various parameters depend on the context where nodes are situated, and suggest corresponding optimal configurations for the algorithm.", "authors": [{"name": "marco conti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81551047856"}, {"name": "matteo mordacchini", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81312484091"}, {"name": "andrea passarella", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100196659"}], "title": "Design and Performance Evaluation of Data Dissemination Systems for Opportunistic Networks Based on Cognitive Heuristics", "citations": [{"Name": "Matteo Mordacchini ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andrea Passarella ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marco Conti ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Stuart M.

In this article, we presentin-networkimplementations of a Bayesian classifier and a condensedkd-treeclassifier for identifying events of interest on resource-lean embedded sensors. The first approach uses preprocessed sensor readings to derive a multidimensional Bayesian classifier used to classify sensor data in real time. The second introduces an innovative condensed kd-tree to represent preprocessed sensor data and uses a fast nearest-neighbor search to determine the likelihood of class membership for incoming samples. Both classifiers consume limited resources and provide high-precision classification. To evaluate each approach, two case studies are considered, in the contexts of human movement and vehicle navigation, respectively. The classification accuracy is above 85&percnt; for both classifiers across the two case studies.", "authors": [{"name": "hao jiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81484654537"}, {"name": "jason o hallstrom", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100345032"}], "title": "Fast, Accurate Event Classification on Resource-Lean Embedded Sensors", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "29\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "185\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "clemson university", "city": null, "Name": "hao jiang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "clemson university", "city": null, "Name": "jason o hallstrom"}]}, "Article No.: 8": {"references": ["S.

The reason for this is not least due to the advent of computing trends like ubiquitous computing, ambient intelligence, and cyber-physical systems, where systems are usually open for dynamic integration and able to react adaptively to changing situations. Despite being open and adaptive, it is a common requirement for such systems to be safe. However, traditional safety assurance techniques, both state-of-the-practice and state-of-the-art ones, are not sufficient in this context. We have recently developed some initial solution concepts based on conditional safety certificates and corresponding runtime analyses. In this article we show how to operationalize these concepts. To this end, we present in detail how to specify conditional safety certificates, how to transform them into suitable runtime models, and how these models finally support dynamic safety evaluations.", "authors": [{"name": "daniel schneider", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350590776"}, {"name": "mario trapp", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330499201"}], "title": "Conditional Safety Certification of Open Adaptive Systems", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "94\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "426\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "mario trapp", "city": null, "Name": "daniel schneider"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Erwin Aitenbichler , Jussi Kangasharju , Max M\u00fchlh\u00e4user, MundoCore: A light-weight infrastructure for pervasive computing, Pervasive and Mobile Computing, v.3 n.4, p.332-361, August, 2007[doi>10.1016/j.pmcj.2007.04.002]\n", "Ibrahim Al-Oqily , Ahmed Karmouch, A Decentralized Self-Organizing Service Composition for Autonomic Entities, ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems (TAAS), v.6 n.1, p.1-18, February 2011[doi>1921641.1921648]\n", "Hyokyung Bahn , Kern Koh , Sang Lyul Min , Sam H.

To set up such an application, the distributed components require spontaneous composition. Since dynamics in the environment and device failures may imply the unavailability of components and devices at any time, finding, maintaining, and adapting such a composition is a nontrivial task. Moreover, the speed of such a configuration process directly influences the user since in the event of a configuration, the user has to wait. In this article, we introduce configuration algorithms for homogeneous and heterogeneous environments. We discuss a comprehensive approach to pervasive application configuration that adapts to the characteristics of the environment: It chooses the most efficient configuration method for the given environment to minimize the configuration latency. Moreover, we propose a new scheme for caching and reusing partial application configurations. This scheme reduces the configuration latency even further such that a configuration can be executed without notable disturbance of the user.", "authors": [{"name": "stephan schuhmann", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81381600186"}, {"name": "klaus herrmann", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100504794"}, {"name": "kurt rothermel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81550427856"}, {"name": "yazan boshmaf", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453654787"}], "title": "Adaptive Composition of Distributed Pervasive Applications in Heterogeneous Environments", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "36\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "313\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of stuttgart", "city": null, "Name": "stephan schuhmann"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of stuttgart", "city": null, "Name": "klaus herrmann"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of stuttgart", "city": null, "Name": "kurt rothermel"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of british columbia", "affiliation_string": "university of british columbia", "city": "vancouver", "Name": "yazan boshmaf"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Malte Appeltauer , Robert Hirschfeld , Michael Haupt , Jens Lincke , Michael Perscheid, A comparison of context-oriented programming languages, International Workshop on Context-Oriented Programming, p.1-6, July 07-07, 2009, Genova, Italy[doi>10.1145/1562112.1562118]\n", "Malte Appeltauer , Michael Haupt , Robert Hirschfeld, Layered method dispatch with INVOKEDYNAMIC: an implementation study, Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Context-Oriented Programming, p.1-6, June 22-22, 2010, Maribor, Slovenia[doi>10.1145/1930021.1930025]\n", "Malte Appeltauer , Robert Hirschfeld , Hidehiko Masuhara , Michael Haupt , Kazunori Kawauchi, Event-specific software composition in context-oriented programming, Proceedings of the 9th international conference on Software composition, July 01-02, 2010, Malaga, Spain\n", "Appeltauer, M., Hirschfeld, R., Haupt, M., and Masuhara, H. 2011.

To achieve adaptation, software must be designed and implemented by following suitable criteria, methods, and strategies. Past research has been mostly addressing adaptation by developing solutions at the software architecture level. This work, instead, focuses on finer-grain programming language-level solutions. We analyze three main linguistic approaches: metaprogramming, aspect-oriented programming, and context-oriented programming. The first two are general-purpose linguistic mechanisms, whereas the third is a specific and focused approach developed to support context-aware applications. This paradigm provides specialized language-level abstractions to implement dynamic adaptation and modularize behavioral variations in adaptive systems.The article shows how the three approaches can support the implementation of adaptive systems and compares the pros and cons offered by each solution.", "authors": [{"name": "guido salvaneschi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81464676000"}, {"name": "carlo ghezzi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100230292"}, {"name": "matteo pradella", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453644372"}], "title": "An Analysis of Language-Level Support for Self-Adaptive Software", "citations": [{"Name": "Marina Mongiello ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Patrizio Pelliccione ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Massimo Sciancalepore", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "109\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "605\n", "Citation Count": "4\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "germany", "university": "technische universitat darmstadt", "affiliation_string": "technische universitat darmstadt", "city": "darmstadt", "Name": "guido salvaneschi"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "politecnico di milano", "city": null, "Name": "carlo ghezzi"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "politecnico di milano", "city": null, "Name": "matteo pradella"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["Tarek F.

It is challenging to guarantee that requests flowing through a multi-tier system will experience an acceptable distribution of delays. The difficulty is mainly due to highly dynamic workloads, the complexity of underlying computer systems, and the lack of accurate performance models. We propose a novel autonomic server provisioning approach based on a model-independent self-adaptive Neural Fuzzy Control (NFC). Existing model-independent fuzzy controllers are designed manually on a trial-and-error basis, and are often ineffective in the face of highly dynamic workloads. NFC is a hybrid of control-theoretical and machine learning techniques. It is capable of self-constructing its structure and adapting its parameters through fast online learning. We further enhance NFC to compensate for the effect of server switching delays. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, compared to a rule-based fuzzy controller and a Proportional-Integral controller, the NFC-based approach delivers superior performance assurance in the face of highly dynamic workloads. It is robust to variation in workload intensity, characteristics, delay target, and server switching delays. We demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the NFC-based approach with a testbed implementation in virtualized blade servers hosting a multi-tier online auction benchmark.", "authors": [{"name": "palden lama", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474701429"}, {"name": "xiaobo zhou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384607560"}], "title": "Autonomic Provisioning with Self-Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Control for Percentile-Based Delay Guarantee", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "45\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "247\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado colorado springs", "city": null, "Name": "palden lama"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado colorado springs", "city": null, "Name": "xiaobo zhou"}]}}, "date": {"month": "July", "year": "2013"}}}, "Volume1": {"Issue2": {"articles": {"Pages: 151-188": {"references": ["Amza, C., Cecchet, E., Chanda, A., Cox, A., Elnikety, S., Gil, R., Marguerite, J., Rajamani, K., and Zwaenepoel, W. 2002.

We use a unified approach to load and fault management based on data replication and reactive replica provisioning. While data replication provides scaling and high availability, reactive provisioning dynamically allocates additional replicas to applications in response to peak loads or failure conditions, thus providing per application performance. We design an efficient method for data migration when joining a new replica to a running application that allows for the quick addition of replicas with minimal disruption of transaction processing. Furthermore, by augmenting the adaptation feedback loop with awareness of the delay introduced by the data migration process in our replicated system, we avoid oscillations in resource allocation.We investigate our transparent database provisioning mechanisms in the context of multitier dynamic content Web servers. We dynamically expand/contract the respective allocations within the database tier for two different applications, the TPC-W e-commerce benchmark and the RUBIS online auction benchmark. We demonstrate that our techniques provide quality of service under different load and failure scenarios.", "authors": [{"name": "gokul soundararajan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100383522"}, {"name": "cristiana amza", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100624449"}], "title": "Reactive provisioning of backend databases in shared dynamic content server clusters", "citations": [{"Name": "Matthias H\u00f6lzl ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Axel Rauschmayer ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Martin Wirsing", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Engineering of Software-Intensive Systems: State of the Art and Research Challenges", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "12\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "870\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "canada", "university": "university of toronto", "affiliation_string": "university of toronto canada", "city": "toronto", "Name": "gokul soundararajan"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of toronto", "affiliation_string": "university of toronto canada", "city": "toronto", "Name": "cristiana amza"}]}, "Pages: 115-150": {"references": ["Gianluca Baldassarre , Stefano Nolfi , Domenico Parisi, Evolution of collective behavior in a team of physically linked robots, Proceedings of the 2003 international conference on Applications of evolutionary computing, April 14-16, 2003, Essex, UK\n", "Baldassarre, G., Parisi, D., and Nolfi, S. 2004.

The first set of experiments is a pioneering study on the utility of self-assembling robots to address relatively complex scenarios, such as cooperative object transport. The results of our work suggest that the s-bots possess hardware characteristics which facilitate the design of control mechanisms for autonomous self-assembly. The control architecture we developed proved particularly successful in guiding the robots engaged in the cooperative transport task. However, the results also showed that some features of the robots' controllers had a disruptive effect on their performances. The second set of experiments is an attempt to enhance the adaptiveness of our multi-robot system. In particular, we aim to synthesise an integrated (i.e., not-modular) decision-making mechanism which allows the s-bot to autonomously decide whether or not environmental contingencies require self-assembly. The results show that it is possible to synthesize, by using evolutionary computation techniques, artificial neural networks that integrate both the mechanisms for sensory-motor coordination and for decision making required by the robots in the context of self-assembly.", "authors": [{"name": "elio tuci", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81342514318"}, {"name": "roderich gro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81456630488"}, {"name": "vito trianni", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100250322"}, {"name": "francesco mondada", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100316610"}, {"name": "michael bonani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384598409"}, {"name": "marco dorigo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81337488576"}], "title": "Cooperation through self-assembly in multi-robot systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Fidel Aznar ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mar Pujol ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ram\u00f3n Rizo", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "L-system-driven self-assembly for swarm robotics", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rehan O'Grady ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Carlo Pinciroli ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Roderich Gro\u00df ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Anders Lyhne Christensen ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Francesco Mondada ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michael Bonani ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marco Dorigo", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Swarm-bots to the rescue", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Roderich Gro\u00df ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shervin Nouyan ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michael Bonani ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Francesco Mondada ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marco Dorigo", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Division of Labour in Self-organised Groups", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Benjamin E.

We show that a simple parameter adaptation is an effective way to improve the efficiency of the group and that it brings forth division of labor between the members of the group. Moreover, robots that are best at retrieving have a higher probability of becoming active retrievers.

Most autonomous systems use Automated Facial Expression Classification (AFEC) and Automated Affect Interpretation (AAI) to achieve sociability. Varying lighting conditions, occlusion, and control over physiognomy can influence the real life performance of vision-based AFEC systems. Physiological signals provide complementary information for AFEC and AAI. We employed transient facial thermal features for AFEC and AAI. Infrared thermal images with participants' normal expression and intentional expressions of happiness, sadness, disgust, and fear were captured. Facial points that undergo significant thermal changes with a change in expression termed as Facial Thermal Feature Points (FTFPs) were identified. Discriminant analysis was invoked on principal components derived from the Thermal Intensity Values (TIVs) recorded at the FTFPs. The cross-validation and person-independent classification respectively resulted in 66.28&percnt; and 56.0&percnt; success rates. Classification significance tests suggest that (1) like other physiological cues, facial skin temperature also provides useful information about affective states and their facial expression; (2) patterns of facial skin temperature variation can complement other cues for AFEC and AAI; and (3) infrared thermal imaging may help achieve artificial sociability in robots and autonomous systems.", "authors": [{"name": "masood mehmood khan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413598663"}, {"name": "michael ingleby", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100508640"}, {"name": "robert d ward", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100633263"}], "title": "Automated Facial Expression Classification and affect interpretation using infrared measurement of facial skin temperature variations", "citations": [{"Name": "G.

In this article, we present a software retrieval service that allows users to select and retrieve software in an easy and efficient way, anywhere and anytime. Two relevant components of this service are: 1) a software ontology (software catalog) which provides users with a semantic description of software elements, hiding the location and access method of various software repositories, and 2) a set of specialist agents that allow browsing of the software catalog (automatically customized for each user), and an efficient retrieval method for the selected software. These agents automatically adapt their behavior to different users and situations by considering the profile and preferences of the users and the network status.In summary, our software-obtaining process based on an ontology and autonomous and adaptive agents presents a qualitative advance with respect to existing solutions: our approach adapts to the features of users, relieving them from knowing the technical features of their devices and the location and access method of various remote software repositories.", "authors": [{"name": "eduardo mena", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100394321"}, {"name": "arantza illarramendi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100364911"}, {"name": "jose a royo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100013091"}, {"name": "alfredo goni", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100328252"}], "title": "A software retrieval service based on adaptive knowledge-driven agents for wireless environments", "citations": [{"Name": "Nikola Mitrovi\u0107 ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jose A.

New environments such as massively large-scale, wide-area computer networks and mobile ad hoc networks have emerged. Common characteristics of these environments include extreme dynamicity, unreliability, and large scale. Traditional approaches to designing distributed applications in these environments based on central control, small scale, or strong reliability assumptions are not suitable for exploiting their enormous potential. Based on the observation that living organisms can effectively organize large numbers of unreliable and dynamically-changing components (cells, molecules, individuals, etc.) into robust and adaptive structures, it has long been a research challenge to characterize the key ideas and mechanisms that make biological systems work and to apply them to distributed systems engineering. In this article we propose a conceptual framework that captures several basic biological processes in the form of a family of design patterns. Examples include plain diffusion, replication, chemotaxis, and stigmergy. We show through examples how to implement important functions for distributed computing based on these patterns. Using a common evaluation methodology, we show that our bio-inspired solutions have performance comparable to traditional, state-of-the-art solutions while they inherit desirable properties of biological systems including adaptivity and robustness.", "authors": [{"name": "ozalp babaoglu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100423066"}, {"name": "geoffrey canright", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100306017"}, {"name": "andreas deutsch", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100239005"}, {"name": "gianni a di caro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81405596094"}, {"name": "frederick ducatelle", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100029349"}, {"name": "luca m gambardella", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100622805"}, {"name": "niloy ganguly", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100305563"}, {"name": "mark jelasity", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100513586"}, {"name": "roberto montemanni", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100061769"}, {"name": "alberto montresor", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100600131"}, {"name": "tore urnes", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332532893"}], "title": "Design patterns from biology for distributed computing", "citations": [{"Name": "Jose Luis Fernandez-Marquez ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Josep Lluis Arcos ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Giovanna Di Marzo Serugendo ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mirko Viroli ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sara Montagna", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Luiz Filipe M.
