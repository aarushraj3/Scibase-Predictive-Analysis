As existing haptic design guidance is not targeted to the specific needs of blind Web users, inappropriate touchable representations of graphical objects may be developed and integrated with Web interfaces, thereby reducing the quality of the browsing experience. This paper describes the evaluation of haptic HTML mappings that were developed using a participatory-design based technique, and presented using the Logitech Wingman force-feedback mouse. Findings have shown that participants were able to identify objects presented haptically, and develop a structural representation of layout from exploring content. Participants were able to perform a range of Web-based tasks that were previously found to be difficult for some blind users when using a screen reader alone. The haptic HTML mappings are presented, along with recommendations for their application derived from a validation study. The design guidance presented offers a standard reference tool for Web designers wanting to develop an accessible browsing application, using the benefits offered by a force-feedback mouse.", "authors": [{"name": "ravi kuber", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100464526"}, {"name": "wai yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100471589"}, {"name": "m sile omodhrain", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81484656871"}], "title": "Evaluation of Haptic HTML Mappings Derived from a Novel Methodology", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "37\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "686\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "ravi kuber"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "wai yu"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "queens university", "affiliation_string": "queens university belfast", "city": "kingston", "Name": "m sile omodhrain"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["Adler, P.

Various speech-based navigation techniques have been examined, and several are available in commercial software applications. Among these alternatives, grid-based navigation has demonstrated both potential and limitations. In this article, we discuss an empirical study that assessed the efficacy of two enhancements to grid-based navigation: magnification and fine-tuning. The magnification capability enlarges the selected region when it becomes sufficiently small, making it easier to see the target and cursor. The fine-tuning capability allows users to move the cursor short distances to position the cursor over the target. The study involved one group of participants with physical disabilities, an age-matched group of participants without disabilities, and a third group that included young adults without disabilities. The results confirm that both magnification and fine-tuning significantly improved the participants\u2019 performance when selecting targets, especially small targets. Providing either, or both, of the proposed enhancements substantially reduced the gaps in performance due to disability and age. The results will inform the design of speech-based target selection mechanism, allowing users to select targets faster while making fewer errors.", "authors": [{"name": "shaojian zhu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81377592003"}, {"name": "jinjuan feng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100140918"}, {"name": "andrew sears", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100101553"}], "title": "Investigating Grid-Based Navigation: The Impact of Physical Disability", "citations": [{"Name": "Tarif Haque ", "Country": "georgia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Emily Liang ", "Country": "georgia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jeff Gray", "Country": "georgia", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "22\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "309\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland", "city": null, "Name": "shaojian zhu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "towson university", "city": null, "Name": "jinjuan feng"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland", "city": null, "Name": "andrew sears"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Helene Brashear , Thad Starner , Paul Lukowicz , Holger Junker, Using Multiple Sensors for Mobile Sign Language Recognition, Proceedings of the 7th IEEE International Symposium on Wearable Computers, p.45, October 21-23, 2003\n", "}}Chao, A.2001.

Motion-capture gloves are used to record the wearer\u2019s handshape. Unfortunately, they require a time-consuming and inexact calibration process each time they are worn. This article describes the design and evaluation of a new calibration protocol for motion-capture gloves, which is designed to make the process more efficient and to be accessible for participants who are deaf and use American Sign Language (ASL). The protocol was evaluated experimentally; deaf ASL signers wore the gloves, were calibrated (using the new protocol and using a calibration routine provided by the glove manufacturer), and were asked to perform sequences of ASL handshapes. Five native ASL signers rated the correctness and understandability of the collected handshape data. In an additional evaluation, ASL signers were asked to perform ASL stories while wearing the gloves and a motion-capture bodysuit (in some cases our new calibration protocol was used, in other cases, the standard protocol). Later, twelve native ASL signers watched animations produced from this motion-capture data and answered comprehension questions about the stories. In both evaluation studies, the new protocol received significantly higher scores than the standard calibration. The protocol has been made freely available online, and it includes directions for the researcher, images and videos of how participants move their hands during the process, and directions for participants (as ASL videos and English text).", "authors": [{"name": "matt huenerfauth", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100240888"}, {"name": "pengfei lu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81444597898"}], "title": "Accurate and Accessible Motion-Capture Glove Calibration for Sign Language Data Collection", "citations": [{"Name": "Yingying Wang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jean E.

One potential design approach to improve the learnability of mobile devices is a Multi-Layered (ML) interface, where novice users start with a reduced-functionality interface layer that only allows them to perform basic tasks, before progressing to a more complex interface layer when they are comfortable. We studied the effects of a ML interface on older adults\u2019 performance in learning tasks on a mobile device. We conducted a controlled experiment with 16 older (ages 65--81) and 16 younger participants (age 21--36), who performed tasks on either a 2-layer or a nonlayered (control) address book application, implemented on a commercial smart phone. We found that the ML interface\u2019s Reduced-Functionality layer, compared to the control\u2019s Full-Functionality layer, better helped users to master a set of basic tasks and to retain that ability 30 minutes later. When users transitioned from the Reduced-Functionality to the Full-Functionality interface layer, their performance on the previously learned tasks was negatively affected, but no negative impact was found on learning new, advanced tasks. Overall, the ML interface provided greater benefit for older participants than for younger participants in terms of task completion time during initial learning, perceived complexity, and preference. We discuss how the ML interface approach is suitable for improving the learnability of mobile applications, particularly for older adults.", "authors": [{"name": "rock leung", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350574362"}, {"name": "leah findlater", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100170743"}, {"name": "joanna mcgrenere", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100232506"}, {"name": "peter graf", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81547163756"}, {"name": "justine yang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81470641041"}], "title": "Multi-Layered Interfaces to Improve Older Adults\u2019 Initial Learnability of Mobile Applications", "citations": [{"Name": "Marios Belk ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "David Portugal ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Eleni Christodoulou ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "George Samaras", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bruno Merlin", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Breaking psychological barrier toward changes: two experiences", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lilit Hakobyan ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jo Lumsden ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dympna O'Sullivan ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hannah Bartlett", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Elliot Cole", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Patient-centered design: interface personalization for individuals with brain injury", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chui Yin Wong", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "A framework of affordance and usability of mobile user interface for older adults", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rock Leung ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Charlotte Tang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shathel Haddad ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Joanna Mcgrenere ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Peter Graf ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Vilia Ingriany", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ronald E.

Much less attention has been given to Web sites that can support complex health-related problem solving, as opposed to more general information search activities, of user populations such as older adults. In this article, we expand on a prior usability study that examined the performance of 112 older adults who were asked to solve two problems using the U. S. government\u2019s Medicare.gov Web site. The indications from that study were that older adults had difficulty carrying out these problem-solving tasks.This article illustrates, in the context of a case study, the use of a structured methodology for obtaining insights into Web site design issues that could make it difficult for healthcare consumers such as older adults to solve health-related problems. Initially, a number of Web design guidelines that have been developed for older users are presented. The argument is made that such checklist-type guidelines, though essential, are difficult to apply to complex Web-based problem-solving activities. Following a review of research in the area of Web-based health information seeking and problem-solving by older adults, the description and implementation of a methodology for aiding designers in anticipating cognitive demands that older users might confront during their problem-solving activities is presented.

Auditory menus have the potential to make those devices more accessible to a wide range of users. However, auditory menus are a relatively new concept, and there are few guidelines that describe how to design them. In this paper, we detail how visual menu concepts may be applied to auditory menus in order to help develop design guidelines. Specifically, we examine how to optimize the designs of a new contextual cue, called \u201cspindex\u201d (i.e., speech index). We developed and evaluated various design alternatives for spindex and iteratively refined the design with sighted users and visually impaired users. As a result, the \u201cattenuated\u201d spindex was the best in terms of preference as well as performance, across user groups. Nevertheless, sighted and visually impaired participants showed slightly different responses and feedback. Results are discussed in terms of acoustical theory, practical display design, and assistive technology design.", "authors": [{"name": "myounghoon jeon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81443595528"}, {"name": "bruce n walker", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100423585"}], "title": "Spindex (Speech Index) Improves Auditory Menu Acceptance and Navigation Performance", "citations": [{"Name": "Myounghoon Jeon ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ju-Hwan Lee", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "The ecological AUI (auditory user interface) design and evaluation of user acceptance for various tasks on smartphones", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Thomas M.

Just as user-centered design shifted the focus of interactive system design from systems to users, ability-based design attempts to shift the focus of accessible design from disability to ability. Although prior approaches to accessible computing may consider users\u2019 abilities to some extent, ability-based design makes ability its central focus. We offer seven ability-based design principles and describe the projects that inspired their formulation. We also present a research agenda for ability-based design.", "authors": [{"name": "jacob o wobbrock", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100086173"}, {"name": "shaun k kane", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329489903"}, {"name": "krzysztof z gajos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100593751"}, {"name": "susumu harada", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319492589"}, {"name": "jon froehlich", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331492504"}], "title": "Ability-Based Design: Concept, Principles and Examples", "citations": [{"Name": "Richard E.

Nevertheless, there are several components of widely used software applications that are still beyond the reach of traditional screen readers and Braille displays. This article investigates the nonvisual accessibility issues associated with the graphing component of Microsoft Excel and proposes a novel approach and system. The goal is to provide flexible multi-modal presentation schemes which can help visually impaired users in comprehending the most commonly used two dimensional business charts, demonstrated within the familiar context of Excel charts. The methodology identifies the need for three distinct strategies used in the user interaction with a chart:exploratory, guided, andsummarization. These methodologies have been implemented using a multimodal approach, which combines aural cues, speech commentaries, and 3-dimensional haptic feedback. The prototype implementation and the preliminary studies suggest that the multimodality can be effectively realized and users denote preferences in intertwining these methodologies to gain understanding of the content of charts. These methodologies have been implemented in a system, which makes use of the Novint Falcon haptic device and integrated as a plug-in in Microsoft Excel.", "authors": [{"name": "iyad abu doush", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418599330"}, {"name": "enrico pontelli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100223962"}, {"name": "tran cao son", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100087211"}, {"name": "dominic simon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81444596315"}, {"name": "ou ma", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81541799956"}], "title": "Multimodal Presentation of Two-Dimensional Charts: An Investigation Using Open Office XML and Microsoft Excel", "citations": [{"Name": "Charles F.

We develop and evaluate a haptic direction indicator that delivers directional information in real time through kinesthetic cues. The indicator uses a novel kinesthetic perception method called the pseudo-attraction force technique, which employs the nonlinear relationship between perceived and physical acceleration to generate a force sensation. In an experiment, we find that the haptic direction indicator allowed people with visual impairments to walk safely along a predefined route at their usual walking pace without any previous training, independent of the existence of auditory information. The findings indicate that the haptic direction indicator is effective at delivering simple navigational information, and is a suitable substitute for and/or enhancement to conventional wayfinding methods.", "authors": [{"name": "tomohiro amemiya", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100595703"}, {"name": "hisashi sugiyama", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384595627"}], "title": "Orienting Kinesthetically: A Haptic Handheld Wayfinder for People with Visual Impairments", "citations": [{"Name": "Shiri Azenkot ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Richard E.

The effects of these innovations are seen not only in major Web services such as wikis and social networking services but also in accessibility services. Collaborative accessibility improvement has great potential to make the Web more adaptive. Screen reader users, developers, site owners, and any Web volunteers who want to help the users are invited into the activities to improve accessibility in a timely manner. The Social Accessibility Project is an experimental service for a new needs-driven improvement model based on collaborative metadata authoring technologies. In 20 months, about 19,000 pieces of metadata were created for more than 3,000 Web pages through collaboration based on 355 requests submitted from users. We encountered many challenges as we sought to create a new mainstream approach and created distinctive features in new user interfaces to address some of these challenges. Although the new features increased user participation, serious issues remain. The productivity of the volunteers exceeded our expectations, but we found large and important problems in the users\u2019 lack of awareness of their own accessibility problems. This is a critical problem for sustaining the active use of the service, because about 70&percnt; of the improvement starts with a request from a user. Helping users with visual impairments understand the actual issues is a crucial and challenging topic, and will lead to improved accessibility. We first introduce examples of collaboration, analyze several kinds of statistics on the activities of the users and volunteers of the pilot service, and then discuss our findings and challenges. Five future foci are considered: site-wide metadata authoring, encouraging active participation by users, quality management for the created metadata, metadata for dynamic HTML applications, and collaborations with site owners.", "authors": [{"name": "daisuke sato", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81327491464"}, {"name": "hironobu takagi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81408594028"}, {"name": "masatomo kobayashi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81338489739"}, {"name": "shinya kawanaka", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81377592090"}, {"name": "chieko asakawa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100044475"}], "title": "Exploratory Analysis of Collaborative Web Accessibility Improvement", "citations": [{"Name": "Gollapudi Vrj Sai Prasad ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "T.

Automatic text simplification is a natural language processing technology that, when mature, could be used to produce texts that are adapted to the specific needs of particular users. Most research in the area of automatic text simplification has dealt with the English language. In this article, we present results from the Simplext project, which is dedicated to automatic text simplification for Spanish. We present a modular system with dedicated procedures for syntactic and lexical simplification that are grounded on the analysis of a corpus manually simplified for people with special needs. We carried out an automatic evaluation of the system\u2019s output, taking into account the interaction between three different modules dedicated to different simplification aspects. One evaluation is based on readability metrics for Spanish and shows that the system is able to reduce the lexical and syntactic complexity of the texts. We also show, by means of a human evaluation, that sentence meaning is preserved in most cases. Our results, even if our work represents the first automatic text simplification system for Spanish that addresses different linguistic aspects, are comparable to the state of the art in English Automatic Text Simplification.", "authors": [{"name": "horacio saggion", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100371947"}, {"name": "sanja stajner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81556011156"}, {"name": "stefan bott", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442614469"}, {"name": "simon mille", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436603067"}, {"name": "luz rello", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81470642423"}, {"name": "biljana drndarevic", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81549150856"}], "title": "Making It Simplext: Implementation and Evaluation of a Text Simplification System for Spanish", "citations": [{"Name": "Frank Rudzicz ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Heidi Christensen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fran\u00e7ois Portet ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jan Alexandersson", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Luz Rello ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Roberto Carlini ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ricardo Baeza-Yates ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jeffrey P.

However, it is the primary mechanism of communications for some speakers who have impaired voice production mechanisms, such as partial laryngectomees, as well as for those prescribed voice rest, which often follows surgery or damage to the larynx. Unlike most people, who choose when to whisper and when not to, these speakers may have little choice but to rely on whispers for much of their daily vocal interaction.Even though most speakers will whisper at times, and some speakers can only whisper, the majority of today\u2019s computational speech technology systems assume or require phonated speech. This article considers conversion of whispers into natural-sounding phonated speech as a noninvasive prosthetic aid for people with voice impairments who can only whisper. As a by-product, the technique is also useful for unimpaired speakers who choose to whisper.Speech reconstruction systems can be classified into those requiring training and those that do not. Among the latter, a recent parametric reconstruction framework is explored and then enhanced through a refined estimation of plausible pitch from weighted formant differences. The improved reconstruction framework, with proposed formant-derived artificial pitch modulation, is validated through subjective and objective comparison tests alongside state-of-the-art alternatives.", "authors": [{"name": "ian v mcloughlin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100659763"}, {"name": "hamid reza sharifzadeh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81464676503"}, {"name": "su lim tan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82459179357"}, {"name": "jingjie li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658720807"}, {"name": "yan song", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452602758"}], "title": "Reconstruction of Phonated Speech from Whispers Using Formant-Derived Plausible Pitch Modulation", "citations": [{"Name": "Frank Rudzicz ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Heidi Christensen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fran\u00e7ois Portet ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jan Alexandersson", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fran\u00e7 Ois Portet ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Heidi Christensen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Frank Rudzicz ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jan Alexandersson", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "59\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "59\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "the university of science and technology of china hefei anhui china", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "ian v mcloughlin"}, {"country": "New Zealand", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "unitec institute of technology auckland new zealand", "city": "auckland", "Name": "hamid reza sharifzadeh"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "singapore institute of technology singapore", "city": null, "Name": "su lim tan"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "the university of science and technology of china hefei anhui china", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "jingjie li"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "the university of science and technology of china hefei anhui china", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "yan song"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["R.

The movements of such speakers are limited by their athetoid symptoms and their consonants are often unstable or unclear, which makes it difficult for them to communicate. Exemplar-based spectral conversion using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is applied to a voice from a speaker with an articulation disorder. In our conventional work, we used a combined dictionary that was constructed from the source speaker\u2019s vowels and the consonants from a target speaker without articulation disorders in order to preserve the speaker\u2019s individuality. However, this conventional exemplar-based approach needs to use all the training exemplars (frames), and it may cause mismatching of phonemes between input signals and selected exemplars. In order to reduce the mismatching of phoneme alignment, we propose a phoneme-categorized subdictionary and a dictionary selection method using NMF. The effectiveness of this method was confirmed by comparing its effectiveness with that of a conventional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based and a conventional exemplar-based method.", "authors": [{"name": "ryo aihara", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658719887"}, {"name": "tetsuya takiguchi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309481613"}, {"name": "yasuo ariki", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81500660860"}], "title": "Individuality-Preserving Voice Conversion for Articulation Disorders Using Phoneme-Categorized Exemplars", "citations": [{"Name": "Fran\u00e7 Ois Portet ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Heidi Christensen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Frank Rudzicz ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jan Alexandersson", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Frank Rudzicz ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Heidi Christensen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fran\u00e7ois Portet ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jan Alexandersson", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "71\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "71\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "japan", "university": "kobe university", "affiliation_string": "graduate school of system informatics kobe university nadaku kobe japan", "city": "kobe", "Name": "ryo aihara"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "kobe university", "affiliation_string": "organization of advanced science and technology kobe university nada-ku kobe japan", "city": "kobe", "Name": "tetsuya takiguchi"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "kobe university", "affiliation_string": "organization of advanced science and technology kobe university nada-ku kobe japan", "city": "kobe", "Name": "yasuo ariki"}]}}, "date": {"month": "June", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Behrooz Ashtiani , I.

With eye typing, a virtual keyboard is shown on the screen and the user enters text by gazing at the intended keys one at a time. With dwell-based eye typing, a key is selected by continuously gazing at it for a specific amount of time. However, this approach has two possible drawbacks: unwanted selections and slow typing rates. In this study, we propose a dwell-free eye typing technique that filters out unintentionally selected letters from the sequence of letters looked at by the user. It ranks possible words based on their length and frequency of use and suggests them to the user. We evaluated Filteryedping with a series of experiments. First, we recruited participants without disabilities to compare it with another potential dwell-free technique and with a dwell-based eye typing interface. The results indicate it is a fast technique that allows an average of 15.95 words per minute after 100min of typing. Then, we improved the technique through iterative design and evaluation with individuals who have severe motor disabilities. This phase helped to identify and create parameters that allow the technique to be adapted to different users.", "authors": [{"name": "diogo pedrosa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81481647317"}, {"name": "maria da graca pimentel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100405223"}, {"name": "amy wright", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658691401"}, {"name": "khai n truong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339532748"}], "title": "Filteryedping: Design Challenges and User Performance of Dwell-Free Eye Typing", "citations": [{"Name": "Yi Liu ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chi Zhang ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chonho Lee ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bu-Sung Lee ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alex Qiang Chen", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Diogo Pedrosa ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Maria da Gra\u00e7a Pimentel ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Khai N.

In this article, we describe and evaluate an Authorable Virtual Peer (AVP), technology designed to help children access peer interactions by supporting them in developing critical social skills. Children interact with the AVP in three ways: (1) engaging in face-to-face interaction with a life-sized, computer-animated child; (2) creating new social behaviors for the AVP; and (3) controlling the AVP using a graphical user interface to select appropriate responses while the AVP interacts with another person. Our evaluation suggests that when an AVP is used as an activity during a social group intervention, a common intervention approach used with children with social and communication difficulties, that children's use of specific social behaviors critical to successful social interaction increases during role-play of common social situations with another child.", "authors": [{"name": "andrea tartaro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81328490714"}, {"name": "justine cassell", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100435029"}, {"name": "corina ratz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658673979"}, {"name": "jennifer lira", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658669070"}, {"name": "valeria nanclares-nogues", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658673560"}], "title": "Accessing Peer Social Interaction: Using Authorable Virtual Peer Technology as a Component of a Group Social Skills Intervention Program", "citations": [{"Name": "Arpita Bhattacharya ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mirko Gelsomini ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Patricia P\u00e9rez-Fuster ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gregory D.

Gaining insight into and understanding of complex data is a highly demanding task for people with visual impairments. Especially in the case of table-based data, the classic approaches of braille-based output devices and printing concepts are limited. Haptic perception requires sequential information processing rather than the parallel processing used by the visual system, which hinders haptic perception to gather a fast overview of and deeper insight into the data. Nevertheless, neuroscientific research has identified great dependencies between haptic perception and the cognitive processing of visual sensing. Based on these findings, we developed a haptic 3D surface representation of classic diagrams and charts, such as bar graphs and pie charts. In a qualitative evaluation study, we identified certain advantages of our relief-type 3D chart approach. Finally, we present an education model for German schools that includes a 3D printing approach to help integrate students with visual impairments.", "authors": [{"name": "jonas braier", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658663985"}, {"name": "katharina lattenkamp", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658667707"}, {"name": "benjamin rathel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658666068"}, {"name": "sandra schering", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658664454"}, {"name": "michael wojatzki", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658673092"}, {"name": "benjamin weyers", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81440621624"}], "title": "Haptic 3D Surface Representation of Table-Based Data for People With Visual Impairments", "citations": [{"Name": "Erin Buehler ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "William Easley ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Samantha McDonald ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Niara Comrie ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Amy Hurst", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "268\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "12\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "385\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of duisburg-essen duisburg germany", "city": "duisburg", "Name": "jonas braier"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of duisburg-essen duisburg germany", "city": "duisburg", "Name": "katharina lattenkamp"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of duisburg-essen duisburg germany", "city": "duisburg", "Name": "benjamin rathel"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of duisburg-essen duisburg germany", "city": "duisburg", "Name": "sandra schering"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of duisburg-essen duisburg germany", "city": "duisburg", "Name": "michael wojatzki"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "rwth aachen university aachen germany", "city": "aachen", "Name": "benjamin weyers"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 8": {"references": ["A.-C.

Even if such tools already exist, they are more widely used in a different context, namely, Computer-Assisted Language Learning, in which the objective is to assess nonnative pronunciation by detecting learners\u2019 mispronunciations at segmental and/or suprasegmental levels. In our work, we sought to determine if the Goodness of Pronunciation (GOP) algorithm, which aims to detect phone-level mispronunciations by means of automatic speech recognition, could also detect segmental deviances in disordered speech. Our main experiment is an analysis of speech from people with unilateral facial palsy. This pathology may impact the realization of certain phonemes such as bilabial plosives and sibilants. Speech read by 32 speakers at four different clinical severity grades was automatically aligned and GOP scores were computed for each phone realization. The highest scores, which indicate large dissimilarities with standard phone realizations, were obtained for the most severely impaired speakers. The corresponding speech subset was manually transcribed at phone level; 8.3&percnt; of the phones differed from standard pronunciations extracted from our lexicon. The GOP technique allowed the detection of 70.2&percnt; of mispronunciations with an equal rate of about 30&percnt; of false rejections and false acceptances. Finally, to broaden the scope of the study, we explored the correlation between GOP values and speech comprehensibility scores on a second corpus, composed of sentences recorded by six people with speech impairments due to cancer surgery or neurological disorders. Strong correlations were achieved between GOP scores and subjective comprehensibility scores (about 0.7 absolute). Results from both experiments tend to validate the use of GOP to measure speech capability loss, a dimension that could be used as a complement to physiological measures in pathologies causing speech disorders.", "authors": [{"name": "thomas pellegrini", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453657985"}, {"name": "lionel fontan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81381600314"}, {"name": "julie mauclair", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81486656749"}, {"name": "jerome farinas", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658712980"}, {"name": "charlotte alazard-guiu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658712116"}, {"name": "marina robert", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658708750"}, {"name": "peggy gatignol", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658712785"}], "title": "Automatic Assessment of Speech Capability Loss in Disordered Speech", "citations": [{"Name": "Heidi Christensen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Frank Rudzicz ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fran\u00e7ois Portet ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jan Alexandersson", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fran\u00e7 Ois Portet ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Heidi Christensen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Frank Rudzicz ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jan Alexandersson", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "86\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "13\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "86\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "france", "university": "universite de toulouse", "affiliation_string": "universite de toulouse ups irit toulouse france", "city": "toulouse", "Name": "thomas pellegrini"}, {"country": "france", "university": "universite de toulouse", "affiliation_string": "universite de toulouse ups irit toulouse france", "city": "toulouse", "Name": "lionel fontan"}, {"country": "France", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universite paris descartes irit paris france", "city": "paris", "Name": "julie mauclair"}, {"country": "france", "university": "universite de toulouse", "affiliation_string": "universite de toulouse ups irit toulouse france", "city": "toulouse", "Name": "jerome farinas"}, {"country": "france", "university": "universite de toulouse", "affiliation_string": "universite de toulouse octogone-lordat toulouse cedex", "city": "toulouse", "Name": "charlotte alazard-guiu"}, {"country": "France", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universite paris ouest nanterre france", "city": "paris", "Name": "marina robert"}, {"country": "France", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "hopital de la pitie salpetriere paris france", "city": "paris", "Name": "peggy gatignol"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["J.

Although a number of studies have addressed the acoustic analysis of speech productions exhibiting impairments, additional descriptive analysis is required to manage interperson variability, considering speakers with the same condition or across different conditions. In this context, this article investigates automatic speech processing approaches dedicated to the detection and localization of abnormal acoustic phenomena in speech signal produced by people with speech disorders. This automatic process aims at enhancing the manual investigation of human experts while at the same time reducing the extent of their intervention by calling their attention to specific parts of the speech considered as atypical from an acoustical point of view.Two different approaches are proposed in this article. The first approach models only the normal speech, whereas the second models both normal and dysarthric speech. Both approaches are evaluated following two strategies: one consists of a strict phone comparison between a human annotation of abnormal phones and the automatic output, while the other uses a \u201cone-phone delay\u201d for the comparison.The experimental evaluation of both approaches for the task of detecting acoustic anomalies was conducted on two different corpora composed of French dysarthric speakers and control speakers. These approaches obtain very encouraging results and their potential for clinical uses with different types of dysarthria and neurological diseases is quite promising.", "authors": [{"name": "imed laaridh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658709226"}, {"name": "corinne fredouille", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81337489025"}, {"name": "christine meunier", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658711214"}], "title": "Automatic Detection of Phone-Based Anomalies in Dysarthric Speech", "citations": [{"Name": "Heidi Christensen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Frank Rudzicz ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fran\u00e7ois Portet ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jan Alexandersson", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fran\u00e7 Ois Portet ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Heidi Christensen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Frank Rudzicz ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jan Alexandersson", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "88\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "11\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "88\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "France", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of avignon cerilia university of aix marseille france", "city": "marseille", "Name": "imed laaridh"}, {"country": "France", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of avignon cerilia france", "city": "avignon", "Name": "corinne fredouille"}, {"country": "France", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of aix marseille cnrs lpl umr 7309 13100 aix-en-provence france", "city": "marseille", "Name": "christine meunier"}]}}, "date": {"month": "June", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 6": {"references": ["R.

While motion-based video games have demonstrated great potential of encouraging physical activity among nondisabled players, the accessibility of motion-based games is limited for persons with mobility disabilities, thus also limiting access to the potential health benefits of playing these games. In our work, we address this issue through the design of wheelchair-accessible motion-based game controls. We present KINECTWheels, a toolkit designed to integrate wheelchair movements into motion-based games. Building on the toolkit, we developed Cupcake Heaven, a wheelchair-based video game designed for older adults using wheelchairs, and we created Wheelchair Revolution, a motion-based dance game that is accessible to both persons using wheelchairs and nondisabled players. Evaluation results show that KINECTWheelscan be applied to make motion-based games wheelchair-accessible, and that wheelchair-based games engage broad audiences in physically stimulating play. Through the application of the wheelchair as an enabling technology in games, our work has the potential of encouraging players of all ages to develop a positive relationship with their wheelchair.", "authors": [{"name": "kathrin m gerling", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81484657431"}, {"name": "regan l mandryk", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100231855"}, {"name": "matthew miller", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87958615957"}, {"name": "michael r kalyn", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81484658362"}, {"name": "max birk", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81557519856"}, {"name": "jan d smeddinck", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81456638428"}], "title": "Designing Wheelchair-Based Movement Games", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "114\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "17\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "140\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of lincoln", "affiliation_string": "university of lincoln united kingdom", "city": "kingston upon hull", "Name": "kathrin m gerling"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of saskatchewan", "affiliation_string": "university of saskatchewan canada", "city": "saskatoon", "Name": "regan l mandryk"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of saskatchewan", "affiliation_string": "university of saskatchewan canada", "city": "saskatoon", "Name": "matthew miller"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of saskatchewan", "affiliation_string": "university of saskatchewan canada", "city": "saskatoon", "Name": "michael r kalyn"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of saskatchewan", "affiliation_string": "university of saskatchewan canada", "city": "saskatoon", "Name": "max birk"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of bremen bremen germany", "city": "bremen", "Name": "jan d smeddinck"}]}, "Article No.: 4e": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2737200", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "richard ladner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658694312"}, {"name": "jonathan lazar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81504682415"}], "title": "Introduction to the ASSETS'13 Special Issue", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "29\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "29\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "richard ladner"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "jonathan lazar"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Brendan Z.

This work attempts to illustrate some of the difficulties the first author usually has to face when operating a computer, due to considerable motor problems. The article will discuss what he tried in the past, and whyOnScreenDualScribe, offering various assistive techniques\u2014including word prediction, an ambiguous keyboard, and stepwise pointing operations\u2014is indeed a viable alternative. In a pilot study that was repeated multiple times with slight variations over a period of 3 years, the first author's entry rate withOnScreenDualScribe(including early versions of the tool) increased from 1.38wpm to 6.16wpm, while his achievable typing rate went from 12wpm to 3.5wpm in the course of 24 years.

Our findings reemphasize the importance of landmarks in nonvisual navigation, demonstrate that GSV is a viable bus stop audit dataset, and show that minimally trained crowd workers can find and identify bus stop landmarks with 82.5&percnt; accuracy across 150 bus stop locations (87.3&percnt; with simple quality control).", "authors": [{"name": "kotaro hara", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81549531656"}, {"name": "shiri azenkot", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81466647758"}, {"name": "megan campbell", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83358973057"}, {"name": "cynthia l bennett", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83358692957"}, {"name": "vicki le", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81549411556"}, {"name": "sean pannella", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83358794757"}, {"name": "robert moore", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83358769557"}, {"name": "kelly minckler", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83358740557"}, {"name": "rochelle h ng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83358925457"}, {"name": "jon e froehlich", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331492504"}], "title": "Improving Public Transit Accessibility for Blind Riders by Crowdsourcing Bus Stop Landmark Locations with Google Street View: An Extended Analysis", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "193\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "20\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "205\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland college park md", "city": null, "Name": "kotaro hara"}, {"country": "United Kingdom", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cornell tech new york ny", "city": "york", "Name": "shiri azenkot"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of washington seattle wa", "city": "washington", "Name": "megan campbell"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of washington seattle wa", "city": "washington", "Name": "cynthia l bennett"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland college park md", "city": null, "Name": "vicki le"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland college park md", "city": null, "Name": "sean pannella"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland college park md", "city": null, "Name": "robert moore"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of washington seattle wa", "city": "washington", "Name": "kelly minckler"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of washington seattle wa", "city": "washington", "Name": "rochelle h ng"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland college park md", "city": null, "Name": "jon e froehlich"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2015"}}}, "Volume4": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Article No.: 15": {"references": ["Anne Adams , Martina Angela Sasse, Users are not the enemy, Communications of the ACM, v.42 n.12, p.40-46, Dec. 1999[doi>10.1145/322796.322806]\n", "Shiri Azenkot , Kyle Rector , Richard Ladner , Jacob Wobbrock, PassChords: secure multi-touch authentication for blind people, Proceedings of the 14th international ACM SIGACCESS conference on Computers and accessibility, October 22-24, 2012, Boulder, Colorado, USA[doi>10.1145/2384916.2384945]\n", "Elizabeth Kay-Raining Bird and Robin S.

Individuals with cognitive disabilities depend on computers and the Internet for a variety of tasks and, therefore, use authentication applications on an everyday basis. However, although there have been numerous studies investigating password usage by neurotypical users, there have been no research studies conducted to examine the use of authentication methods by individuals with cognitive disabilities. In this article, we systematically investigate how individuals with cognitive disabilities, specifically Down syndrome (DS), interact with various user authentication mechanisms. This research provides the first benchmark data on the performance of individuals with DS when using multiple authentication methods. It confirms that individuals with DS are capable of using the traditional alphanumeric passwords with reasonable efficiency. The passwords created by individuals with DS are of similar strength to those created by neurotypical people. Graphic passwords are not as effective as traditional alphanumeric and mnemonic passwords regarding efficiency, and are less preferred by the participants. Based on the findings of the study, we propose design guidelines that aim to assist both practitioners and researchers in designing and developing effective authentication applications that fit the specific needs of individuals with DS.", "authors": [{"name": "yao ma", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548902156"}, {"name": "jinjuan feng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100140918"}, {"name": "libby kumin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81456613263"}, {"name": "jonathan lazar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100417512"}], "title": "Investigating User Behavior for Authentication Methods: A Comparison between Individuals with Down Syndrome and Neurotypical Users", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "89\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "337\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "china", "university": "taiyuan university of technology", "affiliation_string": "taiyuan university of technology", "city": "taiyuan", "Name": "yao ma"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "towson university and umbc", "city": null, "Name": "jinjuan feng"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "loyola university maryland", "city": null, "Name": "libby kumin"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "harvard university and towson university", "city": null, "Name": "jonathan lazar"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Jeremy N.

The aim was to support collaborative learning among sighted and visually impaired pupils. The first application is a static flattened 3D environment that supports learning to distinguish between angles by means of a 3D haptic device providing touch feedback. The second application is a dynamic 3D environment that supports learning of spatial geometry. The scene is a room with a box containing geometrical objects, which pupils can pick up and move around. The applications were evaluated in four schools with groups of two sighted and one visually impaired pupil. The results showed the support for the visually impaired pupil and for the collaboration to be satisfying. A shared understanding of the workspace could be achieved, as long as the virtual environment did not contain movable objects. Verbal communication was crucial for the work process but haptic guiding to some extent substituted communication about direction. When it comes to joint action between visually impaired and sighted pupils a number of interesting problems were identified when the dynamic and static virtual environments were compared. These problems require further investigation. The study extends prior work in the areas of assistive technology and multimodal communication by evaluating functions for joint haptic manipulation in the unique setting of group work in primary school.", "authors": [{"name": "jonas moll", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331499738"}, {"name": "eva-lotta sallnas pysander", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82458694257"}], "title": "A Haptic Tool for Group Work on Geometrical Concepts Engaging Blind and Sighted Pupils", "citations": [{"Name": "Emeline Brul\u00e9 ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gilles Bailly ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Annie Gentes", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "66\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "333\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "royal institute of technology", "city": null, "Name": "jonas moll"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "royal institute of technology", "city": null, "Name": "eva-lotta sallnas pysander"}]}}, "date": {"month": "July", "year": "2013"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Meghan Allen , Joanna McGrenere , Barbara Purves, The Field Evaluation of a Mobile Digital Image Communication Application Designed for People with Aphasia, ACM Transactions on Accessible Computing (TACCESS), v.1 n.1, p.1-26, May 2008[doi>10.1145/1361203.1361208]\n", "Anoto. 2011.Digital Pen and Paper Technology. http://www.anoto.com.\n", "Avery. 2011.

Recently, video games with affordable motion-based input devices have been proposed as a part of therapy to help people recover lost range of motion and motor control. While researchers have demonstrated the potential utility of therapeutic games through controlled studies, relatively little work has explored their long-term home-based use. We conducted a six-week home study with a 62-year-old woman who was seventeen years post-stroke. She played therapeutic games for approximately one hour a day, five days a week. Over the six weeks, she recovered significant motor abilities, which is unexpected given the time since her stroke. We explore detecting such improvements early, using game logs for daily measurements of motor ability to complement the standard measurements that are taken less often. Through observations and interviews, we present lessons learned about the barriers and opportunities that arise from long-term home-based use of therapeutic games.", "authors": [{"name": "gazihan alankus", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100182954"}, {"name": "rachel proffitt", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81472655946"}, {"name": "caitlin kelleher", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100607695"}, {"name": "jack engsberg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81472654352"}], "title": "Stroke Therapy through Motion-Based Games: A Case Study", "citations": [{"Name": "Nuno Matos ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ant\u00f3nio Santos ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ana Vasconcelos", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Cynthia Putnam ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jinghui Cheng", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Guanyun Wang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ye Tao ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dian Yu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chuan Cao ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hongyu Chen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Cheng Yao", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shawn N.

This article describes and evaluates a novel method for modeling and synthesizing ASL animations based on samples of ASL signs collected from native signers. We apply this technique to ASL inflecting verbs, common signs in which the location and orientation of the hands is influenced by the arrangement of locations in 3D space that represent entities under discussion. We train mathematical models of hand movement on animation data of signs produced by a native signer. In evaluation studies with native ASL signers, the verb animations synthesized from our model had similar subjective-rating and comprehension-question scores to animations produced by a human animator; they also achieved higher scores than baseline animations. Further, we examine a split modeling technique for accommodating certain verb signs with complex movement patterns, and we conduct an analysis of how robust our modeling techniques are to reductions in the size of their training data. The modeling techniques in this article are applicable to other types of ASL signs and to other sign languages used internationally. Our models\u2019 parameterization of sign animations can increase the repertoire of generation systems and can partially automate the work of humans using sign language scripting systems.", "authors": [{"name": "pengfei lu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81444597898"}, {"name": "matt huenerfauth", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100240888"}], "title": "Data-Driven Synthesis of Spatially Inflected Verbs for American Sign Language Animation", "citations": [{"Name": "Fran\u00e7 Ois Portet ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Heidi Christensen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Frank Rudzicz ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jan Alexandersson", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "29\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "228\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "city university", "affiliation_string": "the city university of new york graduate center", "city": "london", "Name": "pengfei lu"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "city university", "affiliation_string": "the city university of new york queens college", "city": "london", "Name": "matt huenerfauth"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2039339.2039344", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "acm transactions on accessible computing staff", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548003572"}], "title": "Reviewers", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "14\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "101\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": []}}, "date": {"month": "November", "year": "2011"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Android Community.2012. http://androidcommunity.com/android-most-popular-among-first-time-buyers -in-q4-says-npd-20120206/ (Last accessed 2/12).\n", "Barry, J.

Recoloring tools have been developed to address the problem, but current recolorers are limited in that they work from a model of only one type of congenital CVD (i.e., dichromatism). This model does not adequately describe many other forms of CVD (e.g., more common congenital deficiencies such as anomalous trichromacy, acquired deficiencies such as cataracts or age-related yellowing of the lens, or temporary deficiencies such as wearing tinted glasses or working in bright sunlight), and so standard recolorers work poorly in many situations. In this article we describe an alternate approach that can address these limitations. The new approach, called Situation-Specific Modeling (SSM), constructs a model of a specific user\u2019s color differentiation abilities in a specific situation, and uses that model as the basis for recoloring digital presentations. As a result, SSM can inherently handle all types of CVD, whether congenital, acquired, or environmental. In this article we describe and evaluate several models that are based on the SSM approach. Our first model of individual color differentiation (called ICD-1) works in RGB color space, and a user study showed it to be accurate and robust (both for users with and without congenital CVD). However, three aspects of ICD-1 were identified as needing improvement: the calibration step needed to build the situation-specific model, and the prediction steps used in recoloring were too slow for real-world use; and the results of the model\u2019s predictions were too coarse for some uses. We therefore developed three further techniques: ICD-2 reduces the time needed to calibrate the model; ICD-3 reduces the time needed to make predictions with the model; and ICD-4 provides additional information about the degree of differentiability in a prediction. Our final result is a model of the user\u2019s color perception that handles any type of CVD, can be calibrated in two minutes, and can find replacement colors in near-real time (~1 second for a 64-color image). The ICD models provide a tool that can greatly improve the perceptibility of digital color for many different types of CVD users, and also demonstrates situation-specific modeling as a new approach that can broaden the applicability of assistive technology.", "authors": [{"name": "david r flatla", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81460658260"}, {"name": "carl gutwin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100275704"}], "title": "Situation-Specific Models of Color Differentiation", "citations": [{"Name": "Matthew Herbst ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bo Brinkman", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "32\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "262\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "canada", "university": "university of saskatchewan", "affiliation_string": "university of saskatchewan", "city": "saskatoon", "Name": "david r flatla"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of saskatchewan", "affiliation_string": "university of saskatchewan", "city": "saskatoon", "Name": "carl gutwin"}]}}, "date": {"month": "December", "year": "2012"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 8": {"references": ["Abou-Zahra, S. 2008.

In this case, we recruited twenty-five experienced evaluators to audit four pages for WCAG 2.0 conformance. These pages were chosen to differ in layout, complexity, and accessibility support, thereby creating a small but variable sample.We found that an 80&percnt; agreement between experienced evaluators almost never occurred and that the average agreement was at the 70--75&percnt; mark, while the error rate was around 29&percnt;. Further, trained\u2014but novice\u2014evaluators performing the same audits exhibited the same agreement to that of our more experienced ones, but a reduction on validity of 6--13&percnt; ; the validity that an untrained user would attain can only be a conjecture. Expertise appears to improve (by 19&percnt;) the ability to avoid false positives. Finally, pooling the results of two independent experienced evaluators would be the best option, capturingat most76&percnt; of the true problems and producingonly24&percnt; of false positives. Any otherindependentcombination of audits would achieve worse results.This means that an 80&percnt; target for agreement, when audits are conducted without communication between evaluators, is not attainable, even with experienced evaluators, when working on pages similar to the ones used in this experiment; that the error rate even for experienced evaluators is relatively high and further, that untrained accessibility auditors be they developers or quality testers from other domains, would do much worse than this.", "authors": [{"name": "giorgio brajnik", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100604882"}, {"name": "yeliz yesilada", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100378126"}, {"name": "simon harper", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100139139"}], "title": "Is accessibility conformance an elusive property?

To assess prior knowledge used in naturalistic settings, we systematically collected information about technologies used over 10-day periods from older adults with high and low technology experience and younger adults. Technology repertoires for younger adults and high technology older adults were similar; differences reflected typically different needs for kitchen and health care technologies between the age groups. Technology repertoires for low-technology older adults showed substantial technology usage in many categories. Lower usage compared to high-tech older adults for each category was limited primarily to PC and Internet technologies. Experience differences suggest preferences among low-technology older adults for basic technology usage and for working with people rather than technologies.Participants in all groups were generally successful using their everyday technologies to achieve their goals. Prior knowledge was the most common attribution for success, but external information was also commonly referenced. Relevant prior knowledge included technical, functional, strategy, and self knowledge. High tech older adults did not report more problems than younger adults, but they did attribute more problems to insufficient prior knowledge. Younger adults attributed more problems to interference from prior knowledge. Low-tech older adults reported fewer problems, typically attributing them to insufficient prior knowledge or product/system faults.

To successfully perform ADLs, these people are reliant on the assistance of human caregivers. This leads to a decrease of independence for care recipients and imposes a high burden on caregivers. Assistive Technology for Cognition (ATC) aims to compensate for decreased cognitive functions. ATC systems provide automatic assistance in task execution by delivering appropriate prompts which enable the user to perform ADLs without any assistance of a human caregiver. This leads to an increase of the user\u2019s independence and to a relief of caregiver\u2019s burden. In this article, we describe the design, development and evaluation of a novel ATC system. The TEBRA (TEeth BRushing Assistance) system supports people with moderate cognitive disabilities in the execution of brushing teeth. A main requirement for the acceptance of ATC systems is context awareness: explicit feedback from the user is not necessary to provide appropriate assistance. Furthermore, an ATC system needs to handle spatial and temporal variance in the execution of behaviors such as different movement characteristics and different velocities. The TEBRA system handles spatial variance in a behavior recognition component based on a Bayesian network classifier. A dynamic timing model deals with temporal variance by adapting to different velocities of users during a trial. We evaluate a fully functioning prototype of the TEBRA system in a study with people with cognitive disabilities. The main aim of the study is to analyze the technical performance of the system and the user\u2019s behavior in the interaction with the system with regard to the main hypothesis: is the TEBRA system able to increase the user\u2019s independence in the execution of brushing teeth?", "authors": [{"name": "christian peters", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81440598213"}, {"name": "thomas hermann", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100314625"}, {"name": "sven wachsmuth", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100075972"}, {"name": "jesse hoey", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339505018"}], "title": "Automatic Task Assistance for People with Cognitive Disabilities in Brushing Teeth - A User Study with the TEBRA System", "citations": [{"Name": "Corinne Belley ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sebastien Gaboury ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bruno Bouchard ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Abdenour Bouzouane", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nonintrusive system for assistance and guidance in smart homes based on electrical devices identification", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tanvi Banerjee ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "James M.

As a result, these sites have formative digital libraries of sign language content hidden within their large overall collections. This article explores the problem of locating these sign language (SL) videos and presents techniques for identifying SL videos in such collections. To determine the effectiveness of existing text-based search for locating these SL videos, a series of queries were issued to YouTube to locate SL videos on the top 10 news stories of 2011 according to Yahoo!. Overall precision for the first page of results (up to 20 results) was 42&percnt;. An approach for automatically detecting SL video is then presented. Five video features considered likely to be of value were developed using standard background modeling and face detection. The article compares the results of an SVM classifier when given all permutations of these five features. The results show that a measure of the symmetry of motion relative to the face position provided the best performance of any single feature. When tested against a challenging test collection that included many likely false positives, an SVM provided with all five features achieved 82&percnt; precision and 90&percnt; recall. In contrast, the text-based search (queries with the topic terms and \u201cASL\u201d or \u201csign language\u201d) returned a significant portion of non-SL content---nearly half of all videos found. By our estimates, the application of video-based filtering techniques such as the one proposed here would increase precision from 42&percnt; for text-based queries up to 75&percnt;.", "authors": [{"name": "frank m shipman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100155993"}, {"name": "ricardo gutierrez-osuna", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100001355"}, {"name": "caio d d monteiro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548718056"}], "title": "Identifying Sign Language Videos in Video Sharing Sites", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "39\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "301\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "texas am university", "city": null, "Name": "frank m shipman"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "texas am university", "city": null, "Name": "ricardo gutierrez-osuna"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "texas am university", "city": null, "Name": "caio d d monteiro"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2014"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 2": {"references": ["R.

In-game tasks can be fun, engaging, educational, and socially interactive. But for those who are unable to use traditional methods of computer input such as a mouse and keyboard, there is a barrier to interaction that they must first overcome. Eye-gaze interaction is one method of input that can potentially achieve the levels of interaction required for these games. How we use eye-gaze or the gaze interaction technique depends upon the task being performed, the individual performing it, and the equipment available. To fully realize the impact of participation in these environments, techniques need to be adapted to the person\u2019s abilities. We describe an approach to designing and adapting a gaze interaction technique to support locomotion, a task central to immersive game playing. This is evaluated by a group of young people with cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy. The results show that by adapting the interaction technique, participants are able to significantly improve their in-game character control.", "authors": [{"name": "stephen vickers", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81467642965"}, {"name": "howell istance", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81467651065"}, {"name": "aulikki hyrskykari", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100280101"}], "title": "Performing Locomotion Tasks in Immersive Computer Games with an Adapted Eye-Tracking Interface", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "69\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "266\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "stephen vickers"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "howell istance"}, {"country": "finland", "university": "university of tampere", "affiliation_string": "university of tampere", "city": "tampere", "Name": "aulikki hyrskykari"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["David Ahlstr\u00f6m , Martin Hitz , Gerhard Leitner, An evaluation of sticky and force enhanced targets in multi target situations, Proceedings of the 4th Nordic conference on Human-computer interaction: changing roles, p.58-67, October 14-18, 2006, Oslo, Norway[doi>10.1145/1182475.1182482]\n", "Renaud Blanch , Micha\u00ebl Ortega, Rake cursor: improving pointing performance with concurrent input channels, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 04-09, 2009, Boston, MA, USA[doi>10.1145/1518701.1518914]\n", "Renaud Blanch , Yves Guiard , Michel Beaudouin-Lafon, Semantic pointing: improving target acquisition with control-display ratio adaptation, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, p.519-526, April 24-29, 2004, Vienna, Austria[doi>10.1145/985692.985758]\n", "Bohan, M. and Scarlett, D. 2003.

Compared with younger users though, older adults experience greater difficulties performing cursor positioning tasks, and this can present limitations to using a computer easily and effectively. Target expansion is a technique for improving pointing performance where the target grows dynamically as the cursor approaches. This has the advantage that targets conserve screen real estate in their unexpanded state, yet can still provide the benefits of a larger area to click on. This article presents two studies of target expansion with older and younger participants, involving multidirectional point-select tasks with a computer mouse. Study 1 compares static versus expanding targets, and Study 2 compares static targets with three alternative techniques for expansion. Results show that expansion can improve times by up to 14&percnt;, and reduce error rates by up to 50&percnt;. Additionally, expanding targets are beneficial even when the expansion happens late in the movement, that is, after the cursor has reached the expanded target area or even after it has reached the original target area. The participants\u2019 subjective feedback on the target expansion are generally favorable, and this lends further support for the technique.", "authors": [{"name": "faustina hwang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100582390"}, {"name": "nic hollinworth", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418597496"}, {"name": "nitin williams", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350580810"}], "title": "Effects of Target Expansion on Selection Performance in Older Computer Users", "citations": [{"Name": "Louis Li ", "Country": "israel", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Krzysztof Z.

The potential use of technology by care staff has not been a focus of researcher attention. The work reported here provides initial steps in addressing that gap, considering both the design requirements for this population and presentation of early work on a software system for use by care staff. We describe the development of a software tool for use by care staff, called Portrait, and report two studies related to factors affecting technology use by this population. The results of this research are promising, with Portrait being very positively received by care managers and care staff. Use of this software in a care home for over a month indicated continued use, with care staff returning to the system throughout the test period. The contributions of this research are the identification of factors important in working with a care staff population, the introduction and evaluation of a novel software tool for care staff in residential homes, and the highlighting of potential benefits of technology in assisting care staff.", "authors": [{"name": "gemma webster", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81472653214"}, {"name": "vicki l hanson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100646151"}], "title": "Technology for Supporting Care Staff in Residential Homes", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "91\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "11\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "299\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of aberdeen", "affiliation_string": "university of aberdeen", "city": "aberdeen", "Name": "gemma webster"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of dundee", "affiliation_string": "university of dundee and rochester institute of technology", "city": "dundee", "Name": "vicki l hanson"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2557667", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "matt huenerfauth", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100240888"}, {"name": "kathy mccoy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87058641257"}], "title": "Greetings from the New Editors-in-Chief", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "14\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "114\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "city university", "affiliation_string": "city university of new york", "city": "london", "Name": "matt huenerfauth"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of delaware", "city": null, "Name": "kathy mccoy"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Ahmed Sabbir Arif and Wolfgang Stuerzlinger. 2009.

Keeping the delay short allows end-users to follow and participate in conversations. This article focuses on the fundamental problem that makes real-time captioning difficult: sequential keyboard typing is much slower than speaking. We first surveyed the audio characteristics of 240 one-hour-long captioned lectures on YouTube, such as speed and duration of speaking bursts. We then analyzed how these characteristics impact caption generation and readability, considering specifically our human-poweredcollaborative captioningapproach. We note that most of these characteristics are also present in more general domains. For our caption comparison evaluation, we transcribed a classroom lecture in real-time using all three captioning approaches. We recruited 48 participants (24 DHH) to watch these classroom transcripts in an eye-tracking laboratory. We presented these captions in a randomized, balanced order. We show that both hearing and DHH participants preferred and followed collaborative captions better than those generated by automatic speech recognition (ASR) or professionals due to the more consistentflowof the resulting captions. These results show the potential to reliably capture speech even during sudden bursts of speed, as well as for generating \u201cenhanced\u201d captions, unlike other human-powered captioning approaches.", "authors": [{"name": "raja s kushalnagar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81472654980"}, {"name": "walter s lasecki", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490695200"}, {"name": "jeffrey p bigham", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81338487593"}], "title": "Accessibility Evaluation of Classroom Captions", "citations": [{"Name": "Walter S.

The field has not yet formed a consensus as to how to best conduct evaluations of the quality of sign language animations, and this article explores an important methodological issue for researchers conducting experimental studies with participants who are deaf. Traditionally, when evaluating an animation, some lower and upper baselines are shown for comparison during the study. For the upper baseline, some researchers use carefully produced animations, and others use videos of human signers. Specifically, this article investigates, in studies where signers view animations of sign language and are asked subjective and comprehension questions, whether participants differ in their subjective and comprehension responses when actual videos of human signers are shown during the study. Through three sets of experiments, we characterize how the Likert-scale subjective judgments of participants about sign language animations are negatively affected when they are also shown videos of human signers for comparison -- especially when displayed side-by-side. We also identify a small positive effect on the comprehension of sign language animations when studies also contain videos of human signers. Our results enable direct comparison of previously published evaluations of sign language animations that used different types of upper baselines -- video or animation. Our results also provide methodological guidance for researchers who are designing evaluation studies of sign language animation or designing experimental stimuli or questions for participants who are deaf.", "authors": [{"name": "hernisa kacorri", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474702153"}, {"name": "pengfei lu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81444597898"}, {"name": "matt huenerfauth", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100240888"}], "title": "Effect of Displaying Human Videos During an Evaluation Study of American Sign Language Animation", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "56\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "197\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "city university", "affiliation_string": "the city university of new york graduate center", "city": "london", "Name": "hernisa kacorri"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "city university", "affiliation_string": "the city university of new york graduate center", "city": "london", "Name": "pengfei lu"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "city university", "affiliation_string": "the city university of new york queens college", "city": "london", "Name": "matt huenerfauth"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Johnny Accot , Shumin Zhai, Beyond Fitts' law: models for trajectory-based HCI tasks, Proceedings of the ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human factors in computing systems, p.295-302, March 22-27, 1997, Atlanta, Georgia, USA[doi>10.1145/258549.258760]\n", "David Ahlstr\u00f6m , Martin Hitz , Gerhard Leitner, An evaluation of sticky and force enhanced targets in multi target situations, Proceedings of the 4th Nordic conference on Human-computer interaction: changing roles, p.58-67, October 14-18, 2006, Oslo, Norway[doi>10.1145/1182475.1182482]\n", "Thomas Beauvisage, Computer usage in daily life, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 04-09, 2009, Boston, MA, USA[doi>10.1145/1518701.1518791]\n", "Jeffrey P.

One of the main barriers to assisting individuals with pointing problems is a lack of frequent and low-cost assessment of pointing ability. We are working to build technology to automatically assess pointing problems during every day (or real-world) computer use. To this end, we have gathered and studied real-world pointing use from individuals with motor impairments and older adults. We have used this data to develop novel techniques to analyze pointing performance. In this article, we present learned statistical models that distinguish between pointing actions from diverse populations using real-world pointing samples. We describe how our models could be used to support individuals with different abilities sharing a computer, or one individual who experiences temporary pointing problems. Our investigation contributes to a better understanding of real-world pointing. We hope that these techniques will be used to develop systems that can automatically adapt to users\u2019 current needs in real-world computing environments.", "authors": [{"name": "amy hurst", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100325648"}, {"name": "scott e hudson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81328488846"}, {"name": "jennifer mankoff", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100650762"}, {"name": "shari trewin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100659496"}], "title": "Distinguishing Users By Pointing Performance in Laboratory and Real-World Tasks", "citations": [{"Name": "J.

It offers increased tactile and proprioceptive feedback compared to a phone and, because it is always available, it should allow for quick audio output control without having to retrieve the phone from a pocket or bag. Despite this potential, there has been little investigation of on-body input for users with visual impairments. To assess blind users\u2019 performance with on-body input versus touchscreen input, we conducted a controlled lab study with 12 sighted and 11 blind participants. Study tasks included basic pointing and drawing more complex shape gestures. Our findings confirm past work with sighted users showing that the hand results in faster pointing than the phone. Most important, we also show that: (1) the performance gain of the hand applies to blind users as well, (2) the accuracy of where the pointing finger first lands is higher with the hand than the phone, (3) on-hand pointing performance is affected by the location of targets, and (4) shape gestures drawn on the hand result in higher gesture recognition rates than those on the phone. Our findings highlight the potential of on-body input to support accessible nonvisual mobile computing.", "authors": [{"name": "uran oh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81558395756"}, {"name": "leah findlater", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100170743"}], "title": "A Performance Comparison of On-Hand versus On-Phone Nonvisual Input by Blind and Sighted Users", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "78\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "14\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "78\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland college park md", "city": null, "Name": "uran oh"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland college park md", "city": null, "Name": "leah findlater"}]}, "Article No.: 12": {"references": ["Benetech. 2012.

The goal is to identify methods of creating image descriptions that are inexpensive, effective, and follow established accessibility guidelines. The first method explicitly presented the guidelines to the worker, then the worker constructed the image description in an empty text box and table. The second method queried the worker for image information and then used responses to construct a template-based description according to established guidelines. The descriptions generated through queried image description (QID) were more likely to include information on the image category, title, caption, and units. They were also more similar to one another, based on Jaccard distances of q-grams, indicating that their word usage and structure were more standardized. Last, the workers preferred describing images using QID and found the task easier. Therefore, explicit instruction on image-description guidelines is not sufficient to produce quality image descriptions when using novice Web workers. Instead, it is better to provide information about images, then generate descriptions from responses using templates.", "authors": [{"name": "valerie s morash", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658758138"}, {"name": "yue-ting siu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658765220"}, {"name": "joshua a miele", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83358645457"}, {"name": "lucia hasty", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658767141"}, {"name": "steven landau", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658765397"}], "title": "Guiding Novice Web Workers in Making Image Descriptions Using Templates", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "97\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "17\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "97\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Trinidad and Tobago", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california berkeley berkeley ca", "city": "california", "Name": "valerie s morash"}, {"country": "Mali", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california berkeley  san francisco state university san francisco ca", "city": "san", "Name": "yue-ting siu"}, {"country": "Mali", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the smith-kettlewell eye research institute san francisco ca", "city": "san", "Name": "joshua a miele"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "lucia hasty"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "steven landau"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["Meghan Allen , Joanna McGrenere , Barbara Purves, The Field Evaluation of a Mobile Digital Image Communication Application Designed for People with Aphasia, ACM Transactions on Accessible Computing (TACCESS), v.1 n.1, p.1-26, May 2008[doi>10.1145/1361203.1361208]\n", "Abdullah Al Mahmud , Jean-Bernard Martens, Re-connect: designing accessible email communication support for persons with aphasia, CHI '10 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 10-15, 2010, Atlanta, Georgia, USA[doi>10.1145/1753846.1754009]\n", "A.

We conducted a 3-month study with eight persons with aphasia to better understand how people with aphasia could integrate Amail in their daily life. Subjective data (questionnaires, interviews, and diaries) and objective data (usage logs) were collected to gain understanding of the usage patterns. All persons with aphasia in our study were able to use Amail independently, and four participants continued using Amail after the study period. The usage patterns, especially the frequency and length of the composed email messages, indicated that, over time, persons with aphasia were able to improve their email communication. Email partners also had the impression that their email partners with aphasia were improving gradually. Last but not least, the use of Amail positively influenced the number and quality of social contacts for the persons with aphasia. We also report some of the challenges encountered while conducting the field trial.", "authors": [{"name": "abdullah al mahmud", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81325487779"}, {"name": "jean-bernard martens", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100097605"}], "title": "Iterative Design and Field Trial of an Aphasia-Friendly Email Tool", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "68\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "12\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "68\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "australia", "university": "swinburne university of technology", "affiliation_string": "swinburne university of technology melbourne vic australia", "city": "melbourne", "Name": "abdullah al mahmud"}, {"country": "netherlands", "university": "eindhoven university of technology", "affiliation_string": "eindhoven university of technology az eindhoven netherlands", "city": "eindhoven", "Name": "jean-bernard martens"}]}}, "date": {"month": "November", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["American Psychiatric Association. 2000.

However, in most cases, complementary quantitative evaluations have not been carried out to confirm those results. To contribute to clarifying the validity of these approaches, our study quantitatively evaluated the effect of using language models with location knowledge on the efficiency of a word and sentence prediction system. Using corpora collected for three different locations (classroom, school cafeteria, home), location-specific language models were trained with sentences from each location and compared with a traditional all-purpose language model, trained on all corpora. User tests showed a modest mean improvement of 2.4&percnt; and 1.3&percnt; for Words Per Minute (WPM) and Keystroke Saving Rate (KSR), respectively, but the differences were not statistically significant. Since our text prediction system relies on the concept of sentence reuse, we ran a set of simulations with language models having different sentence knowledge levels (0&percnt;, 25&percnt;, 50&percnt;, 75&percnt;, 100&percnt;). We also introduced in the comparison a second location-aware strategy that combines the location-specific approach with the all-purpose approach (mixed approach). The mixed language models performed better under low sentence-reuse conditions (0&percnt;, 25&percnt;, 50&percnt;) with 1.0&percnt;, 1.3&percnt;, and 1.2&percnt; KSR improvements, respectively. The location-specific language models performed better under high sentence-reuse conditions (75&percnt;, 100&percnt;) with 1.7&percnt; and 1.5&percnt; KSR improvements, respectively.", "authors": [{"name": "luis filipe garcia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658726847"}, {"name": "luis caldas de oliveira", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658726918"}, {"name": "david martins de matos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658724452"}], "title": "Measuring the Performance of a Location-Aware Text Prediction System", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "92\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "92\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "portugal", "university": "instituto politecnico de beja", "affiliation_string": "instituto politecnico de beja beja portugal", "city": "beja", "Name": "luis filipe garcia"}, {"country": "portugal", "university": "universidade de lisboa", "affiliation_string": "inesc id lisboa instituto superior tecnico universidade de lisboa lisboa portugal", "city": "lisbon", "Name": "luis caldas de oliveira"}, {"country": "portugal", "university": "universidade de lisboa", "affiliation_string": "inesc id lisboa instituto superior tecnico universidade de lisboa lisboa portugal", "city": "lisbon", "Name": "david martins de matos"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["Anne Aula , Rehan M.

Previous research suggests that people with cognitive disabilities experience challenges when finding information on websites. Although a number of studies examined the impact of various design guidelines on information search by people with cognitive disabilities, our knowledge in this topic remains limited. To date, no study has been conducted to examine how people with cognitive disabilities navigate in different content structures. We completed an empirical study to investigate the impact of different search methods and content structures on the search behavior of people with cognitive disabilities. 23 participants with various cognitive disabilities completed 15 information search tasks under three conditions: browsing a website with a deep structure (4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4), browsing a website with a broad structure (16 \u00d7 16), and searching through a search engine. The results suggest that the participants overwhelmingly preferred the search engine method to the two browsing conditions. The broad structure resulted in significantly higher failure rates than the search engine condition and the deep structure condition. The causes of failed search tasks were analyzed in detail. Participants frequently visited incorrect categories in both the deep structure and the broad structure conditions. However, it was more difficult to recover from incorrect categories on the lower-level pages in the broad structure than in the deep structure. Under the search engine condition, failed tasks were mainly caused by difficulty in selecting the correct link from the returned list, misspellings, and difficulty in generating appropriate search keywords.", "authors": [{"name": "ruimin hu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658727323"}, {"name": "jinjuan heidi feng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100140918"}], "title": "Investigating Information Search by People with Cognitive Disabilities", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "144\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "22\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "144\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "ruimin hu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "jinjuan heidi feng"}]}}, "date": {"month": "June", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 11": {"references": ["N.

In an effort to understand the perceived lower limits of intelligible sign language video intended for mobile communication, we evaluated sign language video transmitted at four low frame rates (1, 5, 10, and 15 frames per second [fps]) and four low fixed bit rates (15, 30, 60, and 120 kilobits per second [kbps]) at a constant spatial resolution of 320 \u00d7 240 pixels. We discovered an \u201cintelligibility ceiling effect,\u201d in which increasing the frame rate above 10fps did not improve perceived intelligibility, and increasing the bit rate above 60kbps produced diminishing returns. Given the study parameters, our findings suggest that relaxing the recommended frame rate and bit rate to 10fps at 60kbps will provide intelligible video conversations while reducing total bandwidth consumption to 25&percnt; of the ITU-T standard (at least 25fps and 100kbps). As part of this work, we developed theHuman Signal Intelligibility Model, a new conceptual model useful for informing evaluations of video intelligibility and our methodology for creating linguistically accessible web surveys for deaf people. We also conducted a battery-savings experiment quantifying battery drain when sign language video is transmitted at the lower frame rates and bit rates. Results confirmed that increasing the transmission rates monotonically decreased the battery life.", "authors": [{"name": "jessica j tran", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81472644551"}, {"name": "eve a riskin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100467362"}, {"name": "richard e ladner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100297556"}, {"name": "jacob o wobbrock", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100086173"}], "title": "Evaluating Intelligibility and Battery Drain of Mobile Sign Language Video Transmitted at Low Frame Rates and Bit Rates", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "51\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "13\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "51\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United Kingdom", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "thomson reuters new york ny", "city": "york", "Name": "jessica j tran"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of washington seattle wa", "city": "washington", "Name": "eve a riskin"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of washington seattle wa", "city": "washington", "Name": "richard e ladner"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of washington seattle wa", "city": "washington", "Name": "jacob o wobbrock"}]}, "Article No.: 8": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2825095", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "richard ladner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658694312"}, {"name": "jonathan lazar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81504682415"}], "title": "Introduction to the ASSETS\u201913 Special Issue, Part 2", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "57\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "57\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "richard ladner"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "jonathan lazar"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Lisa Anthony , Quincy Brown , Jaye Nias , Berthel Tate , Shreya Mohan, Interaction and recognition challenges in interpreting children's touch and gesture input on mobile devices, Proceedings of the 2012 ACM international conference on Interactive tabletops and surfaces, November 11-14, 2012, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA[doi>10.1145/2396636.2396671]\n", "ArtikPix.

The system uses a client-server architecture model and facilitates task-oriented remote therapeutic training in both in-home and clinical settings. The system allows a speech language pathologist (SLP) to remotely assign speech production exercises to each child through a web interface and the child to practice these exercises in the form of a game on a mobile device. The mobile app records the child's utterances and streams them to a back-end server for automated scoring by a speech-analysis engine. The SLP can then review the individual recordings and the automated scores through a web interface, provide feedback to the child, and adapt the training program as needed. We have validated the system through a pilot study with children diagnosed with apraxia of speech, their parents, and SLPs. Here, we describe the overall client-server architecture, middleware tools used to build the system, speech-analysis tools for automatic scoring of utterances, and present results from a clinical study. Our results support the feasibility of the system as a complement to traditional face-to-face therapy through the use of mobile tools and automated speech analysis algorithms.", "authors": [{"name": "avinash parnandi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548546456"}, {"name": "virendra karappa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83358965857"}, {"name": "tian lan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658646080"}, {"name": "mostafa shahin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83358650157"}, {"name": "jacqueline mckechnie", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83358827757"}, {"name": "kirrie ballard", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81549291456"}, {"name": "beena ahmed", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83358866457"}, {"name": "ricardo gutierrez-osuna", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100001355"}], "title": "Development of a Remote Therapy Tool for Childhood Apraxia of Speech", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "74\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "74\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united states", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "texas am university college station tx united states", "city": null, "Name": "avinash parnandi"}, {"country": "united states", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "texas am university college station tx united states", "city": null, "Name": "virendra karappa"}, {"country": "united states", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "texas am university college station tx united states", "city": null, "Name": "tian lan"}, {"country": "Qatar", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "texas am university at qatar doha qatar", "city": "doha", "Name": "mostafa shahin"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "university of sydney", "affiliation_string": "the university of sydney sydney nsw australia", "city": "sydney", "Name": "jacqueline mckechnie"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "university of sydney", "affiliation_string": "the university of sydney sydney nsw australia", "city": "sydney", "Name": "kirrie ballard"}, {"country": "Qatar", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "texas am university at qatar doha qatar", "city": "doha", "Name": "beena ahmed"}, {"country": "united states", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "texas am university college station tx united states", "city": null, "Name": "ricardo gutierrez-osuna"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["Lisa Anthony , Quincy Brown , Jaye Nias , Berthel Tate, Examining the need for visual feedback during gesture interaction on mobile touchscreen devices for kids, Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Interaction Design and Children, p.157-164, June 24-27, 2013, New York, New York, USA[doi>10.1145/2485760.2485775]\n", "Shiri Azenkot , Jacob O.

As a result, learning to perform gestures without visual feedback can be challenging. We propose and evaluate two techniques to teach touchscreen gestures to users with visual impairments: (1)gesture sonificationto generate sound based on finger touches, creating an audio representation of a gesture; and (2)corrective verbal feedbackthat combined automatic analysis of the user's drawn gesture with speech feedback. To refine and evaluate the techniques, we conducted three controlled laboratory studies. The first study, with 12 sighted participants, compared parameters for sonifying gestures in an eyes-free scenario. We identified pitch+stereo panning as the best combination. In the second study, ten blind and low-vision participants completed gesture replication tasks for single-stroke, multistroke, and multitouch gestures using the gesture sonification feedback. We found that multistroke gestures were more difficult to understand in sonification, but that playing each finger sound serially may improve understanding. In the third study, six blind and low-vision participants completed gesture replication tasks with both the sonification and corrective verbal feedback techniques. Subjective data and preliminary performance findings indicated that the techniques offer complementary advantages: although verbal feedback was preferred overall primarily due to the precision of its instructions, almost all participants appreciated the sonification for certain situations (e.g., to convey speed). This article extends our previous publication on gesture sonification by extending these techniques to multistroke and multitouch gestures. These findings provide a foundation for nonvisual training systems for touchscreen gestures.", "authors": [{"name": "uran oh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81558395756"}, {"name": "stacy branham", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442598659"}, {"name": "leah findlater", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100170743"}, {"name": "shaun k kane", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329489903"}], "title": "Audio-Based Feedback Techniques for Teaching Touchscreen Gestures", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "84\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "14\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "84\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland college park", "city": null, "Name": "uran oh"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland baltimore county", "city": "baltimore", "Name": "stacy branham"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland college park", "city": null, "Name": "leah findlater"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado boulder", "city": null, "Name": "shaun k kane"}]}}, "date": {"month": "November", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 6": {"references": ["American Psychiatric Association. 2000.

To help individuals with AD live at home for longer, we are developing a mobile robot, called ED, intended to assist with activities of daily living through visual monitoring and verbal prompts in cases of difficulty. In a series of experiments, we study speech-based interactions between ED and each of 10 older adults with AD as the latter complete daily tasks in a simulated home environment. Traditional automatic speech recognition is evaluated in this environment, along with rates of verbal behaviors that indicate confusion or trouble with the conversation. Analysis reveals that speech recognition remains a challenge in this setup, especially during household tasks with individuals with AD. Across the verbal behaviors that indicate confusion, older adults with AD are very likely to simply ignore the robot, which accounts for over 40&percnt; of all such behaviors when interacting with the robot. This work provides a baseline assessment of the types of technical and communicative challenges that will need to be overcome for robots to be used effectively in the home for speech-based assistance with daily living.", "authors": [{"name": "frank rudzicz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100438784"}, {"name": "rosalie wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658718823"}, {"name": "momotaz begum", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81337487855"}, {"name": "alex mihailidis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384607433"}], "title": "Speech Interaction with Personal Assistive Robots Supporting Aging at Home for Individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s Disease", "citations": [{"Name": "Fran\u00e7 Ois Portet ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Heidi Christensen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Frank Rudzicz ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jan Alexandersson", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "259\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "27\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "259\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "canada", "university": "university of toronto", "affiliation_string": "toronto rehabilitation institute university of toronto toronto ontario", "city": "toronto", "Name": "frank rudzicz"}, {"country": "Canada", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "toronto rehabilitation institute toronto ontario", "city": "toronto", "Name": "rosalie wang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of massachusetts lowell massachusetts", "city": null, "Name": "momotaz begum"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of toronto", "affiliation_string": "university of toronto toronto rehabilitation institute toronto ontario", "city": "toronto", "Name": "alex mihailidis"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["L.

The dense packaging of visual information requires high fidelity and high bandwidth of the captured data. Even though marker-based optical motion capture provides many desirable features such as high accuracy, global fitting, and the ability to record body and face simultaneously, it is not widely used to record finger motion, especially not for articulated and syntactic motion such as signs. Instead, most signing avatar projects use costly instrumented gloves, which require long calibration procedures. In this article, we evaluate the data quality obtained from optical motion capture of isolated signs from Swedish sign language with a large number of low-cost cameras. We also present a novel dual-sensor approach to combine the data with low-cost, five-sensor instrumented gloves to provide a recording method with low manual postprocessing. Finally, we evaluate the collected data and the dual-sensor approach as transferred to a highly stylized avatar. The application of the avatar is a game-based environment for training Key Word Signing (KWS) as augmented and alternative communication (AAC), intended for children with communication disabilities.", "authors": [{"name": "simon alexanderson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=86159065557"}, {"name": "jonas beskow", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100428426"}], "title": "Towards Fully Automated Motion Capture of Signs -- Development and Evaluation of a Key Word Signing Avatar", "citations": [{"Name": "Fran\u00e7 Ois Portet ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Heidi Christensen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Frank Rudzicz ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jan Alexandersson", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "73\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "73\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Sweden", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "kth - speech music and hearing stockholm sweden", "city": "stockholm", "Name": "simon alexanderson"}, {"country": "Sweden", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "kth - speech music and hearing stockholm sweden", "city": "stockholm", "Name": "jonas beskow"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Ryo Aihara , Tetsuya Takiguchi , Yasuo Ariki, Individuality-Preserving Voice Conversion for Articulation Disorders Using Phoneme-Categorized Exemplars, ACM Transactions on Accessible Computing (TACCESS), v.6 n.4, p.1-17, June 2015[doi>10.1145/2738048]\n", "Erna Alant and Lyle L.

The experiment shows some weaknesses in automatic speech recognition that must be addressed, as well as the need for better adaptation to the user and the environment.

Surprisingly, while no humanoid aspect was introduced in the system, the senior participants were inclined to embody the system.

These methods have typically been used for nontraditional assistive technology applications. Non-traditional assistive technology is generally targeted for users with severe motor disabilities which may last long-term due to illness or injury or short-term due to situational disabilities. Control of a nontraditional assistive technology can vary widely across users depending upon many factors ranging from health to experience. Unfortunately, there is no systematic method for assessing usability of nontraditional assistive technologies to achieve the best control. The current methods to accommodate users through trial-and-error result in the loss of valuable time and resources as users sometimes have diminishing abilities or suffer from terminal illnesses. This work describes a methodology for objectively measuring an individual\u2019s ability to control a specific nontraditional assistive technology, thus expediting the technology-fit process.", "authors": [{"name": "adriane b randolph", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81337492572"}, {"name": "melody m moore jackson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442617605"}], "title": "Assessing Fit of Nontraditional Assistive Technologies", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "40\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "469\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "kennesaw state university", "city": null, "Name": "adriane b randolph"}, {"country": "georgia", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "georgia institute of technology", "city": null, "Name": "melody m moore jackson"}]}, "Article No.: 15": {"references": ["Beritelli, F., Casale, S., Russo, A., and Serrano, S.2006.

Simultaneous presentation of a single, unified task in two alternative modalities provides multiple paths to successful task completion. We present two alternative task completion strategies, based on differing input strategies (menu-based vs. free text entry). Empirical results from studies involving both blind and sighted users validate both the usability and accessibility of these differing strategies, with blind users achieving successful task completion rates above 90&percnt;.

It is a software environment for building component-based AAC applications, grounded on the Design for All principles and a hybrid---communityandcommercial---Open Source development model. ITHACA addresses the developers, the vendors, as well as the people who use AAC. We introduce a new viewpoint on the AAC product design-develop-distribute lifecycle, and a novel way to search-select-modify-maintain the AAC aid. ITHACA provides programmers with a set of tools and reusable Open Source code for building AAC software components. It also facilitates AAC product vendors to put together sophisticated applications using the available on the Web, independently premanufactured, free or commercial software parts. Furthermore, it provides people who use AAC with a variety of compatible AAC software products which incorporate multimodal, user-tailored interfaces that can fulfill their changing needs. The ITHACA architecture and the proposed fusion of past and current approaches, trends and technologies are explained. ITHACA has been successfully applied by implementing a family of AAC products, based on interchangeable components. Several ready to use ITHACA-based components, including on-screen keyboards, Text-to-Speech, symbol selection sets, e-chatting, emailing, and scanning-based input, as well as four complete communication aids addressing different user cases have been developed. This demonstration showed good acceptance of the ITHACA applications and substantial improvement of the end users\u2019 communication skills. Developers\u2019 experience on working in ITHACA\u2019s Open Source projects was also positively evaluated. More importantly, the potential contribution of the component-based framework and Open Source development model combination to the AAC community emerged.", "authors": [{"name": "alexandros pino", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100067974"}, {"name": "georgios kouroupetroglou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100234186"}], "title": "ITHACA: An Open Source Framework for Building Component-Based Augmentative and Alternative Communication Applications", "citations": [{"Name": "Silvia Artoni ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Maria Claudia Buzzi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marina Buzzi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Claudia Fenili ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Simona Mencarini", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Accessible education for autistic children: ABA-based didactic software", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "35\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "483\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "greece", "university": "university of athens", "affiliation_string": "national and kapodistrian university of athens", "city": "athens", "Name": "alexandros pino"}, {"country": "greece", "university": "university of athens", "affiliation_string": "national and kapodistrian university of athens", "city": "athens", "Name": "georgios kouroupetroglou"}]}}, "date": {"month": "June", "year": "2010"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Johnny Accot , Shumin Zhai, More than dotting the i's --- foundations for crossing-based interfaces, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 20-25, 2002, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA[doi>10.1145/503376.503390]\n", "David Ahlstr\u00f6m, Modeling and improving selection in cascading pull-down menus using Fitts' law, the steering law and force fields, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 02-07, 2005, Portland, Oregon, USA[doi>10.1145/1054972.1054982]\n", "David Ahlstr\u00f6m , Martin Hitz , Gerhard Leitner, An evaluation of sticky and force enhanced targets in multi target situations, Proceedings of the 4th Nordic conference on Human-computer interaction: changing roles, p.58-67, October 14-18, 2006, Oslo, Norway[doi>10.1145/1182475.1182482]\n", "Benjamin B.

In a previous baseline study, we examined the types of difficulties younger and older adults encounter when using pen-based input. The research reported in this article seeks to address one of these errors, namely, missing just below. This error occurs in a menu selection task when a user\u2019s selection pattern is downwardly shifted, such that the top edge of the menu item below the target is selected relatively often, while the corresponding top edge of the target itself is seldom selected. We developed two approaches for addressing missing just below errors: reassigning selections along the top edge and deactivating them. In a laboratory evaluation, only the deactivated edge approach showed promise overall. Further analysis of our data revealed that individual differences played a large role in our results and identified a new source of selection difficulty. Specifically, we observed two error-prone groups of users: the low hitters, who, like participants in the baseline study, made missing just below errors, and the high hitters, who, in contrast, had difficulty with errors on the item above. All but one of the older participants fell into one of these error-prone groups, reinforcing that older users do need better support for selecting menu items with a pen. Preliminary analysis of the performance data suggests both of our approaches were beneficial for the low hitters, but that additional techniques are needed to meet the needs of the high hitters and to address the challenge of supporting both groups in a single interface.", "authors": [{"name": "karyn moffatt", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100235288"}, {"name": "joanna mcgrenere", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100232506"}], "title": "Exploring Methods to Improve Pen-Based Menu Selection for Younger and Older Adults", "citations": [{"Name": "Aqueasha Martin-Hammond ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Abdullah Ali ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Catherine Hornback ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Amy K.

Privacy concerns are a potential barrier to adoption of such technology. Using data from a national Web survey (n=1,518), we focus on perceived acceptability of sharing information about toileting, taking medications, moving about the home, cognitive ability, driving behavior, and vital signs with five targets: family, healthcare providers, insurance companies, researchers, and government. We also examine acceptability of recording the behaviors using three methods: video with sound, video without sound, and sensors. Results show that sharing or recording information about toileting behavior; sharing information with the government and insurance companies; and recording the information using video were least acceptable. Respondents who reported current disability were significantly more accepting of sharing and recording of information than nondisabled adults, controlling for demographic variables, general technology attitudes, and assistive device use. Results for age were less consistent, although older respondents tended to be more accepting than younger respondents. The study provides empirical evidence from a large national sample of the implicit trade-offs between privacy and the potential for improved health among older and disabled adults in quality of life technology applications.", "authors": [{"name": "scott beach", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435597957"}, {"name": "richard schulz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100314449"}, {"name": "julie downs", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81315488083"}, {"name": "judith matthews", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435593742"}, {"name": "bruce barron", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435600969"}, {"name": "katherine seelman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435592702"}], "title": "Disability, Age, and Informational Privacy Attitudes in Quality of Life Technology Applications: Results from a National Web Survey", "citations": [{"Name": "Marianne Dee ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Vicki L.

Older adults often meet difficulties while trying to interact with complex, demanding systems in their daily life. One approach to enable older adults to use new technologies in a safe and efficient way is the provision of training programs. In this article we report about a promising training strategy using video modeling in conjunction with other instructional methods to enhance learning. Cognitive as well as socio-motivational aspects will be addressed. We assessed if guided error training in video modeling will improve learning outcomes for a Ticket Vending Machine (TVM). To investigate if the training method might be beneficial for younger adults as well, we compared 40 younger and 40 older adult learners in a guided error training course with error-free training. Younger and older participants made fewer mistakes in guided error training, but no differences occurred in task completion times. Moreover, self-efficacy increased with training for both age groups, but no significant differences were found for the training condition. Analysis of knowledge gains showed a significant benefit of guided error training in structural knowledge. Overall, the results showed that guided error training may enhance learning for younger and older adults who are learning to use technology.", "authors": [{"name": "doreen struve", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435605737"}, {"name": "hartmut wandke", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100649135"}], "title": "Video Modeling for Training Older Adults to Use New Technologies", "citations": [{"Name": "G\u00fcnther Schreder ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michael Smuc ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Karin Siebenhandl ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Eva Mayr", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Age and computer self-efficacy in the use of digital technologies: an investigation of prototypes for public self-service terminals", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Beno\u00eet Otjacques ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marc Krier ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fernand Feltz ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dieter Ferring ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Martine Hoffmann", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Designing for older people: a case study in a retirement home", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Proceedings of the 6th international conference on HCI in work and learning", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "61\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "857\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "humboldt university berlin", "city": null, "Name": "doreen struve"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "humboldt university berlin", "city": null, "Name": "hartmut wandke"}]}}, "date": {"month": "May", "year": "2009"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 12": {"references": ["James L.

Unfortunately, graphing and analysis software typically is largely inaccessible to users with vision impairment. Using sound to represent data (i.e., sonification or auditory graphs) can make data analysis more accessible; however, there are few guidelines for designing such displays for maximum effectiveness. One crucial yet understudied design issue is exactly how changes in data (e.g., temperature) are mapped onto changes in sound (e.g., pitch), and how this may depend on the specific user. In this study, magnitude estimation was used to determine preferred data-to-display mappings, polarities, and psychophysical scaling functions relating data values to underlying acoustic parameters (frequency, tempo, or modulation index) for blind and visually impaired listeners. The resulting polarities and scaling functions are compared to previous results with sighted participants. There was general agreement about polarities obtained with the two listener populations, with some notable exceptions. There was also evidence for strong similarities regarding the magnitudes of the slopes of the scaling functions, again with some notable differences. For maximum effectiveness, sonification software designers will need to consider carefully their intended users\u2019 vision abilities. Practical implications and limitations are discussed.", "authors": [{"name": "b n walker", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100423585"}, {"name": "l m mauney", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81456639471"}], "title": "Universal Design of Auditory Graphs: A Comparison of Sonification Mappings for Visually Impaired and Sighted Listeners", "citations": [{"Name": "Stephanie Ludi", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andrew Sears ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Vicki L.

Computers and computer-related devices have the potential to help these children in education, career development, and independent living. Our understanding of computer usage by this population is quite limited. Most of the software, games, and Web sites that children with Down syndrome interact with are designed without consideration of their special needs, making the applications less effective or completely inaccessible. We conducted a large-scale survey that collected computer usage information from the parents of approximately six hundred children with Down syndrome. This article reports the text responses collected in the survey and is intended as a step towards understanding the difficulties children with Down syndrome experience while using computers. The relationship between the age and the specific type of difficulties, as well as related design challenges are also reported. A number of potential research directions and hypotheses are identified for future studies. Due to limitations in survey methodology, the findings need to be further validated through hypothesis-driven, empirical studies.", "authors": [{"name": "jinjuan feng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100140918"}, {"name": "jonathan lazar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100417512"}, {"name": "libby kumin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81456613263"}, {"name": "ant ozok", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100310870"}], "title": "Computer Usage by Children with Down Syndrome: Challenges and Future Research", "citations": [{"Name": "Andr\u00e9 Brand\u00e3o ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lenisa Brand\u00e3o ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Giancarlo Nascimento ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bruno Moreira ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Cristina Nader Vasconcelos ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Esteban Clua", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Janio Jadan-Guerrero ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Javier Jaen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mar\u00eda A.

For individuals with visual or dexterity impairments, however, one or both of those synergistic elements are impacted, reducing the usability and therefore the utility of the 3D virtual world. This article considers what features are necessary to make virtual worlds usable by such individuals. Empirical work has been based on a multiplayer 3D virtual world game called PowerUp, to which we have built in an extensive set of accessibility features. These features include in-world navigation and orientation tools, font customization, self-voicing text-to-speech output, key remapping options, and keyboard-only and mouse-only navigation. Through empirical work with legally blind teenagers and adults with cerebral palsy, these features have been refined and validated. Whereas accessibility support for users with visual impairment often revolves around keyboard navigation, these studies emphasized the need to support visual aspects of pointing device actions too. Other notable findings include use of speech to supplement sound effects for novice users, and, for those with cerebral palsy, a general preference to use a pointing device to look around the world, rather than keys or on-screen buttons. The PowerUp accessibility features provide a core level of accessibility for the user groups studied.", "authors": [{"name": "shari trewin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100659496"}, {"name": "mark laff", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100347998"}, {"name": "vicki hanson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100646151"}, {"name": "anna cavender", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100369055"}], "title": "Exploring Visual and Motor Accessibility in Navigating a Virtual World", "citations": [{"Name": "John R.

Without the use of directed tasks, interviews, questionnaires, or question-answer sessions, researchers must rely fully upon observation of behavior, and the categorization and quantification of the participant\u2019s actions. This problem is compounded further by the lack of metrics to quantify the behavior of nonverbal subjects in computer-based intervention contexts. We present a set of dependent variables called A3 (pronounced A-Cubed) or Annotation for ASD Analysis, to assess the behavior of this demographic of users, specifically focusing on engagement and vocalization. This paper demonstrates how theory from multiple disciplines can be brought together to create a set of dependent variables, as well as demonstration of these variables, in an experimental context. Through an examination of the existing literature, and a detailed analysis of the current state of computer vision and speech detection, we present how computer automation may be integrated with the A3 guidelines to reduce coding time and potentially increase accuracy. We conclude by presenting how and where these variables can be used in multiple research areas and with varied target populations.", "authors": [{"name": "joshua hailpern", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351599207"}, {"name": "karrie karahalios", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350570757"}, {"name": "james halle", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81377592145"}, {"name": "laura dethorne", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81377592368"}, {"name": "mary-kelsey coletto", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81377593176"}], "title": "A3: HCI Coding Guideline for Research Using Video Annotation to Assess Behavior of Nonverbal Subjects with Computer-Based Intervention", "citations": [{"Name": "Donald McMillan ", "Country": "denmark", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Moira McGregor ", "Country": "denmark", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Barry Brown", "Country": "denmark", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Roberto Fag\u00e1", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jr. ", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bruno C.

Current practice is to use descriptors such as medical diagnoses to represent a person\u2019s physical capabilities. This solution is not adequate due to similarities in functional capabilities between diagnoses as well as differences in capabilities within a diagnosis. An alternative is user self-reporting or observation by another person, but these solutions can be problematic because they rely on individual interpretations of capabilities and may introduce unwanted bias. The current research focuses on defining an objective, quantifiable, repeatable, and efficient methodology for assessing an individual\u2019s physical capabilities in relation to use of information technologies. Thirty-one users with a range of physical capabilities participated in the evaluation of the proposed performance-based functional assessment methodology. Building on the current standard for such assessments, multiple observers provided independent assessments that served as the gold standard for comparison. Promising metrics produced through the performance-based assessment were identified through comparisons with these observer evaluations. Predictive models were then generated via regression and correlation analysis. The models were validated using a three-fold validation process. Results from this initial research are encouraging, with the resulting models explaining up to 92&percnt; of the variance in user capabilities. Directions for future research are discussed.", "authors": [{"name": "kathleen j price", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81312484587"}, {"name": "andrew sears", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100101553"}], "title": "The Development and Evaluation of Performance-Based Functional Assessment: A Methodology for the Measurement of Physical Capabilities", "citations": [{"Name": "Kathleen J.

Planning and scripting the movements of a virtual character\u2019s arms and body to perform a grammatically correct and understandable ASL sentence is a difficult task, and the timing subtleties of the animation can be particularly challenging. After examining the psycholinguistics literature on the speed and timing of ASL, we have designed software to calculate realistic timing of the movements in ASL animations. We have built algorithms to calculate the time-duration of signs and the location/length of pauses during an ASL animation. To determine whether our software can improve the quality of ASL animations, we conducted a study in which native ASL signers evaluated the ASL animations processed by our algorithms. We have found that: (1) adding linguistically motivated pauses and variations in sign-durations improved signers\u2019 performance on a comprehension task and (2) these animations were rated as more understandable by ASL signers.", "authors": [{"name": "matt huenerfauth", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100240888"}], "title": "A Linguistically Motivated Model for Speed and Pausing in Animations of American Sign Language", "citations": [{"Name": "Jin-Woo Chung ", "Country": "norway", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ho-Joon Lee ", "Country": "norway", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jong C.

As a result, computing education needs to respond by providing students opportunities to learn about accessibility and designing for inclusion. This article presents results of a qualitative research study of practices in teaching accessibility in university-level programs in the US. The study included interviews with 18 professors from some of the top universities in the US and a content analysis of syllabi and other teaching materials. Using the pedagogical theory of authentic learning and elements from the 21st Century Skills framework, we found that instructors emphasized the need for students to develop awareness and understanding for a diversity of ICT users through multiple different experiences; experiences that included research projects that directly involve users with disabilities, guest speakers, field trips, simulating disabilities, and the use of videos/movies. Additionally, instructors used multiple resources (e.g., research papers, online resources), in part, to offset the challenge that there is a perceived lack of a comprehensive textbook. Instructors also emphasized the importance of their individual initiative; that is, the inclusion of accessible topics or courses was often linked to a faculty member's research and/or personal commitment. This article contributes to a gap in the literature by disseminating and sharing different approaches to teaching accessibility across multiple instructors, courses, and campuses.", "authors": [{"name": "cynthia putnam", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81377592342"}, {"name": "maria dahman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658757400"}, {"name": "emma rose", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81328490167"}, {"name": "jinghui cheng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548783656"}, {"name": "glenn bradford", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418598769"}], "title": "Best Practices for Teaching Accessibility in University Classrooms: Cultivating Awareness, Understanding, and Appreciation for Diverse Users", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "30\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "30\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "30\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "nigeria", "university": "paul university", "affiliation_string": "depaul university chicago il", "city": "awka", "Name": "cynthia putnam"}, {"country": "nigeria", "university": "paul university", "affiliation_string": "depaul university chicago il", "city": "awka", "Name": "maria dahman"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of washington tacoma tacoma wa", "city": "washington", "Name": "emma rose"}, {"country": "nigeria", "university": "paul university", "affiliation_string": "depaul university chicago il", "city": "awka", "Name": "jinghui cheng"}, {"country": "nigeria", "university": "paul university", "affiliation_string": "depaul university chicago il", "city": "awka", "Name": "glenn bradford"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2016"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Frances K., Aldrich and Linda Sheppard. 2001.

Blind students often rely on tactile graphics to access textbook images. Many textbook images have a large number of text labels that need to be made accessible. In order to do so, we propose TGV, which uses QR codes to replace the text, as an alternative to Braille. The codes are read with a smartphone application. We evaluated the system with a longitudinal study where 10 blind and low-vision participants completed tasks using three different modes on the smartphone application: (1) no guidance, (2) verbal guidance, and (3) finger-pointing guidance. Our results show that TGV is an effective way to access text in tactile graphics, especially for those blind users who are not fluent in Braille. We also found that preferences varied greatly across the modes, indicating that future work should support multiple modes. We expand upon the algorithms we used to implement the finger pointing, algorithms to automatically place QR codes on documents. We also discuss work we have started on creating a Google Glass version of the application.", "authors": [{"name": "catherine m baker", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81458642818"}, {"name": "lauren r milne", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83358939557"}, {"name": "ryan drapeau", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658728929"}, {"name": "jeffrey scofield", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100481760"}, {"name": "cynthia l bennett", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83358692957"}, {"name": "richard e ladner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100297556"}], "title": "Tactile Graphics with a Voice", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "71\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "17\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "71\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of washington stevens way seattle wa", "city": "washington", "Name": "catherine m baker"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of washington stevens way seattle wa", "city": "washington", "Name": "lauren r milne"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of washington stevens way seattle wa", "city": "washington", "Name": "ryan drapeau"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of washington stevens way seattle wa", "city": "washington", "Name": "jeffrey scofield"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of washington stevens way seattle wa", "city": "washington", "Name": "cynthia l bennett"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of washington stevens way seattle wa", "city": "washington", "Name": "richard e ladner"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2853995", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "john richards", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658973522"}], "title": "Introduction to the ASSETS \u201914 Special Issue", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "39\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "39\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": []}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Scott Beach , Richard Schulz , Julie Downs , Judith Matthews , Bruce Barron , Katherine Seelman, Disability, Age, and Informational Privacy Attitudes in Quality of Life Technology Applications: Results from a National Web Survey, ACM Transactions on Accessible Computing (TACCESS), v.2 n.1, p.1-21, May 2009[doi>10.1145/1525840.1525846]\n", "A.

However, it is often difficult to recruit such a range of users, particularly in a timely manner, nor is it easy for new researchers to understand how to recruit relevant populations or feel confident in communicating with older or \u201cvulnerable\u201d users. We report on the establishment of a large user pool created to facilitate accessibility research through recruiting sizeable numbers of older adults potentially interested in taking part in research studies about technology. We suggest points to guide new researchers and invite other experts to build on these. We also sketch some of the lessons learned from creating and maintaining this pool of individuals, including thoughts on issues for others wishing to set up similar pools.", "authors": [{"name": "marianne dee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658646409"}, {"name": "vicki l hanson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100646151"}], "title": "A Pool of Representative Users for Accessibility Research: Seeing through the Eyes of the Users", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "108\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "32\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "108\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of dundee", "affiliation_string": "university of dundee scotland", "city": "dundee", "Name": "marianne dee"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of dundee", "affiliation_string": "rochester institute of technology usa university of dundee scotland", "city": "dundee", "Name": "vicki l hanson"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Faisal Ahmed , Yevgen Borodin , Yury Puzis , I.

Despite this recent popularity among sighted people, the use of auditory feedback to access digital information is not new for visually impaired users. However, its sequential nature undermines both blind and sighted people\u2019s ability to efficiently find relevant information in the midst of several potentially useful items. We propose taking advantage of theCocktail Party Effect, which states that people are able to focus on a single speech source among several conversations, but still identify relevant content in the background. Therefore, in contrast to one sequential speech channel, we hypothesize that people can leverage concurrent speech channels to quickly get the gist of digital information. In this article, we present an experiment with 46 (23 blind, 23 sighted) participants, which aims to understand people\u2019s ability to search for relevant content listening to two, three, or four concurrent speech channels. Our results suggest that both blind and sighted people are able to process concurrent speech in scanning scenarios. In particular, the use of two concurrent sources may be used both to identify and understand the content of the relevant sentence. Moreover, three sources may be used for most people depending on the task intelligibility demands and user characteristics. Contrasting with related work, the use of different voices did not affect the perception of concurrent speech but was highly preferred by participants. To complement the analysis, we propose a set of scenarios that may benefit from the use of concurrent speech sources, for both blind and sighted people, toward aDesign for Allparadigm.", "authors": [{"name": "joao guerreiro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81467649970"}, {"name": "daniel goncalves", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100240223"}], "title": "Scanning for Digital Content: How Blind and Sighted People Perceive Concurrent Speech", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "89\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "42\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "89\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "portugal", "university": "universidade de lisboa", "affiliation_string": "instituto superior tecnico universidade de lisboainesc-id lisboa portugal", "city": "lisbon", "Name": "joao guerreiro"}, {"country": "portugal", "university": "universidade de lisboa", "affiliation_string": "instituto superior tecnico universidade de lisboainesc-id lisboa portugal", "city": "lisbon", "Name": "daniel goncalves"}]}}, "date": {"month": "January", "year": "2016"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Paulo Blikstein and Dennis Krannich. 2013.

Although 3D printing is infiltrating mainstream education, little research has explored 3D printing in the context of students with special support needs. We describe our studies on this topic and the resulting contributions. We initially conducted a formative study exploring the use of 3D printing at three locations serving populations with varying ability, including individuals with cognitive, motor, and visual impairments. We found that 3D design and printing perform three functions in special education: (1) STEM engagement, (2) creation of educational aids for accessible curriculum content, and (3) making custom adaptive devices. As part of our formative work, we also discussed a case study in the codesign of an assistive hand grip created with occupational therapists at one of our investigation sites. This work inspired further studies on the creation of adaptive devices using 3D printers. We identified the needs and constraints of these therapists and found implications for a specialized 3D modeling tool to support their use of 3D printers. We developed GripFab, 3D modeling software based on feedback from therapists, and used it to explore the feasibility of in-house 3D object designs in support of accessibility. Our contributions include case studies at three special education sites and discussion of obstacles to efficient 3D printing in this context. We have extended these contributions with a more in-depth look at the stakeholders and findings from GripFab studies. We have expanded our discussion to include suggestions for researchers in this space, in addition to refined suggestions from our earlier work for technologists creating 3D modeling and printing tools, therapists seeking to leverage 3D printers, and educators and administrators looking to implement these design tools in special education environments.", "authors": [{"name": "erin buehler", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=60000000405"}, {"name": "niara comrie", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658758308"}, {"name": "megan hofmann", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658652727"}, {"name": "samantha mcdonald", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658644693"}, {"name": "amy hurst", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100325648"}], "title": "Investigating the Implications of 3D Printing in Special Education", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "47\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "47\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "47\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland baltimore county baltimore md", "city": "baltimore", "Name": "erin buehler"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland baltimore county baltimore md", "city": "baltimore", "Name": "niara comrie"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "colorado state university fort collins co", "city": null, "Name": "megan hofmann"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland baltimore county baltimore md", "city": "baltimore", "Name": "samantha mcdonald"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland baltimore county baltimore md", "city": "baltimore", "Name": "amy hurst"}]}, "Article No.: 8": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2891030", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "john richards", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658973522"}], "title": "Introduction to the ASSETS\u201914 Special Issue, Part 2", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "19\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "19\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "19\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": []}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["J.

These problems may be especially difficult for power wheelchair users, as the frame of their wheelchair may obstruct the users\u2019 range of motion and reduce their ability to reach objects in the environment. The concept of \u201cchairable\u201d input devices refers to input devices that are designed to fit with the form of an individual's wheelchair, much like wearable technology fits with an individual's clothing. In this paper, we introduce a new family of chairable input devices: Gest-Rests. A Gest-Rest is a gesture based input device that fits over a standard power wheelchair armrest. A Gest-Rest enables users to perform traditional touch screen gestures, such as press and flick, as well as pressure-based gestures such as squeezing and punching. We have developed the Gest-Rest Family, a suite of armrest-based input devices designed for power wheelchair users. In this paper, we present formative evaluations of these prototypes with wheelchair users and therapists and present their opinions of this new integrated input technology. Our results show the benefits of armrest-based input devices as well as a comparison of physical switches, force sensing, and capacitive input for individuals with limited dexterity.", "authors": [], "title": "The Gest-Rest Family: Exploring Input Possibilities for Wheelchair Armrests", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "6\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "6\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "jian-ming changkevin chang", "city": null, "Name": "patrick carrington"}]}}, "date": {"month": "April", "year": "2016"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Aging in Place Technology Watch. 2011.

E-mail is the primary form of online communication for older adults. However, e-mail communication currently requires access to and the ability to use an Internet-connected computer or device, which may be problematic due to barriers of physical access, expense, insufficient computer skill, or other accessibility issues. To address this, the present work leverages the pervasive hardware of traditional phones and familiar nonvisual models of phone-based interaction to create a new e-mail interface for older adults. We examine the potential of e-mail interaction via traditional phones through long-term field observations, prototype testing, and a four-week field-based user study. Our findings indicate that a simple voice e-mail interface accessed through traditional phones is usable for older adults and is a useful way for offline older adults to interact with an e-mail account. The ease of use and convenience of a phone-based interface are important given the \u201cwork\u201d of keeping in touch over e-mail, and this approach has the potential to open up new avenues of online access for older adults who are still offline or who have late-life disabilities that make using traditional graphical e-mail systems difficult. This project contributes new insights regarding the ways in which voice interfaces can support asynchronous online communication for older adults and provides design guidance for the development of subsequent voice interfaces.", "authors": [{"name": "robin brewer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81467645148"}, {"name": "raymundo cornejo garcia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658977324"}, {"name": "tedmond schwaba", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87958638357"}, {"name": "darren gergle", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100246470"}, {"name": "anne marie piper", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81316490036"}], "title": "Exploring Traditional Phones as an E-Mail Interface for Older Adults", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "90\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "26\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "90\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "cambodia", "university": "western university", "affiliation_string": "northwestern university evanston illinois", "city": "phnum penh", "Name": "robin brewer"}, {"country": "cambodia", "university": "western university", "affiliation_string": "northwestern university evanston illinois", "city": "phnum penh", "Name": "raymundo cornejo garcia"}, {"country": "cambodia", "university": "western university", "affiliation_string": "northwestern university evanston illinois", "city": "phnum penh", "Name": "tedmond schwaba"}, {"country": "cambodia", "university": "western university", "affiliation_string": "northwestern university evanston illinois", "city": "phnum penh", "Name": "darren gergle"}, {"country": "cambodia", "university": "western university", "affiliation_string": "northwestern university evanston illinois", "city": "phnum penh", "Name": "anne marie piper"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Simon L.

In contrast to Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in which the transition between speech sounds is often brief and mainly addressed by the coarticulation effect, the sign transition in continuous SLR is far from being clear and usually not easily and exactly characterized. Leveraging upon hidden Markov modeling techniques from ASR, we proposed a modeling framework for continuous SLR having the following major advantages, namely: (i) the system is easy to scale up to large-vocabulary SLR; (ii) modeling of signs as well as the transitions between signs is robust even for noisy data collected in real-world SLR; and (iii) extensions to training, decoding, and adaptation are directly applicable even with new deep learning algorithms. A pair of low-cost digital gloves affordable for the deaf and hard of hearing community is used to collect a collection of training and testing data for real-world SLR interaction applications. Evaluated on 1,024 testing sentences from five signers, a word accuracy rate of 87.4&percnt; is achieved using a vocabulary of 510 words. The SLR speed is in real time, requiring an average of 0.69s per sentence. The encouraging results indicate that it is feasible to develop real-world SLR applications based on the proposed SLR framework.", "authors": [{"name": "kehuang li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658980686"}, {"name": "zhengyu zhou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658981440"}, {"name": "chin-hui lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452598559"}], "title": "Sign Transition Modeling and a Scalable Solution to Continuous Sign Language Recognition for Real-World Applications", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "90\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "48\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "90\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "georgia institute of technology atlanta ga", "city": "atlanta", "Name": "kehuang li"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "research and technology center robert bosch llc", "city": null, "Name": "zhengyu zhou"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "georgia institute of technology atlanta ga", "city": "atlanta", "Name": "chin-hui lee"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["B.

Assistive Technologies (ATs) used by people with disabilities are observable to others and, as a result, can affect how AT users are perceived. This raises the possibility that what we call \u201csocial accessibility\u201d may be as important as \u201cfunctional accessibility\u201d when considering ATs. But, to date, ATs have almost exclusively been regarded asfunctionalaids. For example, ATs are defined by the Technical Assistance to the States Act as technologies that are \u201cused to increase, maintain or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities.\u201d To investigate perceptions and self-perceptions of AT users, we conducted a diary study of two groups of participants: people with disabilities and people without disabilities. Our goal was to explore the types of interactions and perceptions that arise around AT use in social and public spaces. During our 4-week study, participants with sensory disabilities wrote about feeling eitherself-consciousorself-confidentwhen using an assistive device in a social or public situation. Meanwhile, participants without disabilities were prompted to record their reactions and feelings whenever they saw ATs used in social or public situations. We found that AT form and function does influence social interactions by impacting self-efficacy and self-confidence. When the design of form or function is poor, or when inequality between technological accessibility exists, social inclusion is negatively affected, as are perceptions of ability. We contribute a definition for the \u201csocial accessibility\u201d of ATs and subsequently offerDesign for Social Accessibility (DSA)as a holistic design stance focused on balancing an AT user's sociotechnical identity with functional requirements.", "authors": [{"name": "kristen shinohara", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319501668"}, {"name": "jacob o wobbrock", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100086173"}], "title": "Self-Conscious or Self-Confident?

In the early 1990's, accessibility was mostly an add-on, with only Apple computers having built-in access. Computers were playing an increasingly important role in education and employment, but had not yet completely integrated themselves into all aspects of life as completely as they have today. The World Wide Web as we know it had not yet been born. Today there are accessibility features built directly into every major operating system, and one OS even includes a built-in screen reader. Assistive technologies are more numerous and capable. And awareness of the importance of access is much higher. However, some things have not changed. Assistive technologies lag behind mainstream technologies in both compatibility and functionality. Effective assistive technologies are often beyond the financial reach of those who need them. Effective assistive technologies are not available in many countries and many languages, even though technology is reaching into education, employment, and daily living of more countries and more people in each country every year. In moving forward we need to build on what we have achieved and explore new concepts, such as acommon technical core, ubiquitous accessibility, micro assistive technology, andfree public accessibility. Cooperative and collaborative approaches also need to be explored if we are to have any hope of catching up and keeping up with the ever-accelerating mainstream information and communication technologies.", "authors": [{"name": "gregg c vanderheiden", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100641036"}], "title": "Ubiquitous Accessibility, Common Technology Core, and Micro Assistive Technology: Commentary on \u201cComputers and People with Disabilities\u201d", "citations": [{"Name": "Matthew Tylee Atkinson ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Matthew J.

In this article, Glinert and York issued a \u201ccall-to-arms\u201d for research and development on technologies for people with disabilities. Specifically, they highlighted that human-computer interfaces at the time generally failed to take into account the needs of disabled users. Their challenge was to change computing culture to address this need. Their article remains timely today in its consideration of government, industry, and private foundations working with researchers to achieve accessible technology. With the recent launch ofTransactions on Accessible Computing, this seems an appropriate time to consider progress in the field since, as well as current research trends.The reprinting of this article is followed by four commentaries by leaders in accessibility research. Each was cited in the 1992 article and each now gives their view on how the field has progressed since that time. In their commentaries, some themes emerge and new technologies are discussed. In short, their commentaries point to both a great deal of progress and a lack of progress. All four of the commentators note areas where computing continues to present barriers rather than assist users with disabilities.Alistair Edwards sets the stage with a look back at interfaces and input technologies popular in 1992, with attention paid to access problems related to graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that have consumed much research energy since 1992. Alan Newell highlights disability concerns that were not given large research consideration in 1992, but which have now become significant due, in large part, to changes in global demographics. Specifically, he brings visibility to research on older adults and cognitively disabled users.A number of advances in technology and methodology since 1992 are discussed by the commentators. The ubiquity of computing and its critical adoption in the world today are highlighted. The commentators reflect, for example, on technologies produced by research for disabled users that have now impacted mainstream offerings on standards for accessibility that have emerged worldwide and their impact and on assistive technologies that have been developed. Critically, the proliferation of the World Wide Web was not foreseen in 1992 and its use by people with disabilities is discussed. Gregg Vanderheiden considers the opportunity afforded by the Web to provide widespread availability of accessible software.Glinert and York discussed the need for design for disability. While research relevant to users with disabilities is gaining momentum, the commentators indicate that users with disabilities still struggle with much of today's IT. The commentators note current trends toward designs that take into account disabled users. Notably, Richard Ladner ends his commentary by mentioning the issue of empowerment. Users with disabilities have moved beyond simply needing the protections of regulation that were emerging in 1992, to being active participants in designing solutions to allow full participation in the current social, political, and economic environments.Together, these articles provide a great deal of food for thought on technology advances and new considerations of accessible technology.

This article examines the potential of haptic and auditory trajectory playback as a method of teaching shapes and gestures to visually impaired people. Two studies are described which test the success of teaching simple shapes. The first study examines haptic trajectory playback alone, played through a force-feedback device, and compares performance of visually impaired users with sighted users. It demonstrates that the task is significantly harder for visually impaired users. The second study builds on these results, combining force-feedback with audio to teach visually impaired users to recreate shapes. The results suggest that users performed significantly better when presented with multimodal haptic and audio playback of the shape, rather than haptic only. Finally, an initial test of these ideas in an application context is described, with sighted participants describing drawings to visually impaired participants through touch and sound. This study demonstrates in what situations trajectory playback can prove a useful role in a collaborative setting.", "authors": [{"name": "andrew crossan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100494227"}, {"name": "stephen brewster", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100359199"}], "title": "Multimodal Trajectory Playback for Teaching Shape Information and Trajectories to Visually Impaired Computer Users", "citations": [{"Name": "Jing Su ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alyssa Rosenzweig ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ashvin Goel ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Eyal de Lara ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Khai N.

Our project used a streamlined process with three phases: (1) a rapid participatory design and development phase with two speech-language pathologists acting as representative users, (2) an informal usability study with five aphasic participants, which caught usability problems and provided preliminary feedback on the usefulness of PhotoTalk, and (3) a one-month field evaluation with two aphasic participants followed by a one-month secondary field evaluation with one aphasic participant, which showed that they all used it regularly and relatively independently, although not always for its intended communicative purpose.

It also includes a sophisticated word prediction component which dynamically calculates the most appropriate words for a given context. This component is auto-adaptive, that is, it learns with every text the user enters. It thus adapts its predictions to the user's language and the current topic of communication as well.

One challenge is positioning the mouse cursor within confined target areas; another is executing a precise click without slipping. These problems can make mouse pointing in graphical user interfaces very difficult for some people. This article explores goal crossing as an alternative strategy for more accessible target acquisition. In goal crossing, targets are boundaries that are simply crossed by the mouse cursor. Thus, goal crossing avoids the two aforementioned problems. To date, however, researchers have not examined the feasibility of goal crossing for people with motor difficulties. We therefore present a study comparing area pointing and goal crossing. Our performance results indicate that although Fitts' throughput for able-bodied users is higher for area pointing than for goal crossing (4.72 vs. 3.61 bits/s), the opposite is true for users with motor impairments (2.34 vs. 2.88 bits/s). However, error rates are higher for goal crossing than for area pointing under a strict definition of crossing errors (6.23% vs. 1.94%). We also present path analyses and an examination of submovement velocity, acceleration, and jerk (the change in acceleration over time). These results show marked differences between crossing and pointing and almost categorically favor crossing. An important finding is that crossing reduces jerk for both participant groups, indicating more fluid, stable motion. To help realize the potential of goal crossing for computer access, we offer design concepts for crossing widgets that address the occlusion problem, which occurs when one crossing goal obscures another in persistent mouse-cursor interfaces. This work provides the motivation and initial steps for further exploration of goal crossing on the desktop, and may help researchers and designers to radically reshape user interfaces to provide accessible goal crossing, thereby lowering barriers to access.", "authors": [{"name": "jacob o wobbrock", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100086173"}, {"name": "krzysztof z gajos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100593751"}], "title": "Goal Crossing with Mice and Trackballs for People with Motor Impairments: Performance, Submovements, and Design Directions", "citations": [{"Name": "Eun Kyoung Choe ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kristen Shinohara ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Parmit K.

Thirty adults with moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease participated in two personally relevant conversations with an AAC device. For twelve of the participants the AAC device included voice output. The AAC device was the FlexiboardTMcontaining sixteen messages needed to discuss a favorite autobiographical topic chosen by the participant and his/her family caregivers. Ten-minute conversations were videotaped in participants\u2019 residences and analyzed for four conversational measures related to the participants\u2019 communicative behavior. Results show that AAC devices with digitized voice output depress conversational performance and distract participants with moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease as compared to similar devices without voice output. There were significantly more 1-word utterances and fewer total utterances when AAC devices included voice output, and the rate of topic elaborations/initiations was significantly lower when voice output was present.

The main problem with these systems is that the communication process tends to be exceedingly slow, since the system must scan through the available choices one at a time until the desired message is reached. One way of raising the speed of message selection is to optimize the elementary scanning delay in real time so that it allows the user to make selections as quickly as possible without making too many errors. With this objective in mind, this article presents a method for optimizing the scanning delay, which is based on an analysis of the data recorded in \u201clog files\u201d while applying the EDiTH system [Digital Teleaction Environment for People with Disabilities]. This analysis makes it possible to develop a human-machine interaction model specific to the study, and then to establish an adaptive algorithm for the calculation of the scanning delay. The results obtained with imposed scenarios and then in ecological situations provides a confirmation that our algorithms are effective in dynamically adapting a scan speed. The main advantage offered by the procedure proposed is that it works on timing information alone and thus does not require any knowledge of the scanning device itself. This allows it to work with any scanning device.", "authors": [{"name": "souhir ghedira", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81414618279"}, {"name": "pierre pino", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384598414"}, {"name": "guy bourhis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384597041"}], "title": "Conception and Experimentation of a Communication Device with Adaptive Scanning", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "10\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "327\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universite paul verlaine metz", "city": null, "Name": "souhir ghedira"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universite paul verlaine metz", "city": null, "Name": "pierre pino"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universite paul verlaine metz", "city": null, "Name": "guy bourhis"}]}, "Article No.: 17": {"references": ["Anson, D., Moist, P., Przywara, M., Wells, H., Saylor, H., and Maxime, H.2006.

It has been questioned, however, whether such savings translate into an enhanced communication rate due to the additional overhead (e.g., shifting of focus and repeated scanning of a prediction list) required in using such a system. Our hypothesis is that word prediction has high potential for enhancing AAC communication rate, but the amount is dependent in a complex way on the accuracy of the predictions. Due to significant user interface variations in AAC systems and the potential bias of prior word prediction experience on existing devices, this hypothesis is difficult to verify. We present a study of two different word prediction methods compared against letter-by-letter entry at simulated AAC communication rates. We find that word prediction systems can in fact speed communication rate (an advanced system gave a 58.6&percnt; improvement), and that a more accurate word prediction system can raise the communication rate higher than is explained by the additional accuracy of the system alone due to better utilization (93.6&percnt; utilization for advanced versus 78.2&percnt; for basic).", "authors": [{"name": "keith trnka", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309504296"}, {"name": "john mccaw", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81414621008"}, {"name": "debra yarrington", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309497978"}, {"name": "kathleen f mccoy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100228295"}, {"name": "christopher pennington", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100342962"}], "title": "User Interaction with Word Prediction: The Effects of Prediction Quality", "citations": [{"Name": "Francesco Curatelli ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chiara Martinengo", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Enhancing digital inclusion with an English pseudo-syllabic keyboard", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Proceedings of the 6th international conference on HCI in work and learning", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chong Tze Yuang ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rafael E.
