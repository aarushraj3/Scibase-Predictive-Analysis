In this model, each link has a unit price, and each agent tries to minimize its cost, which is either its eccentricity or its total distance to other players in the underlying (undirected) graph of the created network. Two versions of the game are studied: In the MAX version, the cost incurred to a vertex is the maximum distance between the vertex and other vertices, and, in the SUM version, the cost incurred to a vertex is the sum of distances between the vertex and other vertices. We prove that in both versions pure Nash equilibria exist, but the problem of finding the best response of a vertex is NP-hard. We take the social cost of the created network to be its diameter, and next we study the maximum possible diameter of an equilibrium graph withnvertices in various cases. When the sum of players\u2019 budgets isn\u2212 1, the equilibrium graphs are always trees, and we prove that their maximum diameter is \u0398(n) and \u0398(logn) in MAX and SUM versions, respectively. When each vertex has a unit budget (i.e., can establish a link to just one vertex), the diameter of any equilibrium graph in either version is \u0398(1). We give examples of equilibrium graphs in the MAX version, such that all vertices have positive budgets and yet the diameter is \u03a9(&surd;logn). This interesting (and perhaps counterintuitive) result shows that increasing the budgets may increase the diameter of equilibrium graphs and hence deteriorate the network structure. Then we prove that every equilibrium graph in the SUM version has diameter 2O(&surd;logn). Finally, we show that if the budget of each player is at leastk, then every equilibrium graph in the SUM version isk-connected or has a diameter smaller than 4.", "authors": [{"name": "shayan ehsani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81479652986"}, {"name": "saber shokat fadaee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658699067"}, {"name": "mohammadamin fazli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81481650391"}, {"name": "abbas mehrabian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81485641811"}, {"name": "sina sadeghian sadeghabad", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502795144"}, {"name": "mohammadali safari", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81466640897"}, {"name": "morteza saghafian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81481650263"}], "title": "A Bounded Budget Network Creation Game", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "114\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "11\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "114\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "saber shokat fadaee", "city": null, "Name": "shayan ehsani"}, {"country": "iran", "university": "sharif university of technology", "affiliation_string": "sharif university of technology tehran iran", "city": "tehran", "Name": "mohammadamin fazli"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of waterloo", "affiliation_string": "university of waterloo waterloo on canada", "city": "waterloo", "Name": "abbas mehrabian"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "mohammadali safari", "city": null, "Name": "sina sadeghian sadeghabad"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "abbas mehrabian", "city": null, "Name": "sharif university of technology tehran iran"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "abbas mehrabian", "city": null, "Name": "sharif university of technology tehran iran"}]}, "Article No.: 32": {"references": ["Patrizio Angelini , Giuseppe Di Battista , Fabrizio Frati , V\u00edt Jel\u00ednek , Jan Kratochv\u00edl , Maurizio Patrignani , Ignaz Rutter, Testing planarity of partially embedded graphs, Proceedings of the twenty-first annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete Algorithms, p.202-221, January 17-19, 2010, Austin, Texas\n", "Patrizio Angelini , Giuseppe Di Battista , Fabrizio Frati , Maurizio Patrignani , Ignaz Rutter, Testing the simultaneous embeddability of two graphs whose intersection is a biconnected or a connected graph, Journal of Discrete Algorithms, 14, p.150-172, July, 2012[doi>10.1016/j.jda.2011.12.015]\n", "P.

Unlike many cases, in which the presence of a partial solution in the input makes an otherwise easy problem hard, we show that the planarity question remains polynomial-time solvable. Our algorithm is based on several combinatorial lemmas, which show that the planarity of partially embedded graphs exhibits the \u2018TONCAS\u2019 behavior \u201cthe obvious necessary conditions for planarity are also sufficient.\u201d These conditions are expressed in terms of the interplay between (1) the rotation system and containment relationships between cycles and (2) the decomposition of a graph into its connected, biconnected, and triconnected components. This implies that no dynamic programming is needed for a decision algorithm and that the elements of the decomposition can be processed independently.Further, by equipping the components of the decomposition with suitable data structures and by carefully splitting the problem into simpler subproblems, we make our algorithm run in linear time.Finally, we consider several generalizations of the problem, such as minimizing the number of edges of the partial embedding that need to be rerouted to extend it, and argue that they are NP-hard. We also apply our algorithm to the simultaneous graph drawing problemSimultaneous Embedding with Fixed Edges (Sefe). There we obtain a linear-time algorithm for the case that one of the input graphs or the common graph has a fixed planar embedding.", "authors": [{"name": "patrizio angelini", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413602279"}, {"name": "giuseppe di battista", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100238529"}, {"name": "fabrizio frati", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413595202"}, {"name": "vit jelinek", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81321493175"}, {"name": "jan kratochvil", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100082692"}, {"name": "maurizio patrignani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100599480"}, {"name": "ignaz rutter", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435593339"}], "title": "Testing Planarity of Partially Embedded Graphs", "citations": [{"Name": "Zachary Abel ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Robert Connelly ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sarah Eisenstat ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Radoslav Fulek ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Filip Mori\u0107 ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yoshio Okamoto ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tibor Szab\u00f3 ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Csaba D.

While located at a vertex, the robot is capable of ordering the vertices it sees in counterclockwise order as they appear on the boundary, and for every two such vertices, it can distinguish whether the angle between them is convex (&les; \u03c0) or reflex ( > \u03c0).

Roughly speaking, this is the smallest graph that cannot be distinguished by a robot fromGby its observations alone, no matter how it moves. Combining this result with various other techniques allows the ability to show that a robot exploring a polygonPwith the preceding capabilities is always capable of reconstructing the visibility graph ofP.

The case of this problem on polygonal obstacles is well studied. In this article, we consider the problem version on curved obstacles, which are commonly modeled assplinegons. A splinegon can be viewed as replacing each edge of a polygon by a convex curved edge (polygons are special splinegons), and the combinatorial complexity of each curved edge is assumed to beO(1). Given in the plane two pointssandtand a setsofhpairwise disjoint splinegons with a total ofnvertices, after abounded degree decompositionofSis obtained, we compute a shortests-to-tpath avoiding the splinegons inO(n&plus;hlogh&plus;k) time, wherekis a parameter sensitive to the geometric structures of the input and is upper bounded byO(h2). The bounded degree decomposition ofS, which is similar to the triangulation of the polygonal domains, can be computed inO(nlogn) time orO(n&plus;hlog1 &plus; &epsi;h) time for any &epsi; > 0. In particular, when all splinegons are convex, the decomposition can be computed inO(n&plus;hlogh) time andkis linear to the number of common tangents in the free space (called \u201cfree common tangents\u201d) among the splinegons. Our techniques also improve several previous results:(1) For the polygon case (i.e., when all splinegons are polygons), the shortest path problem was previously solved inO(nlogn) time, or inO(n&plus;h2logn) time. Thus, our algorithm improves theO(n&plus;h2logn) time result, and is faster than theO(nlogn) time solution for sufficiently smallh, for example,h=o(&sqrt;n,logn.(2) Our techniques produce an optimal output-sensitive algorithm for a basic visibility problem of computing all free common tangents amonghpairwise disjoint convex splinegons with a total ofnvertices. Our algorithm runs inO(n&plus;hlogh&plus;k) time andO(n) working space, wherekis the number of all free common tangents. Note thatk&equals;O(h2). Even for the special case where all splinegons are convexpolygons, the previously best algorithm for this visibility problem takesO(n&plus;h2logn) time.(3) We improve the previous work for computing the shortest path between two points among convex pseudodisks ofO(1) complexity each.In addition, a by-product of our techniques is an optimalO(n&plus;hlogh) time andO(n) space algorithm for computing the Voronoi diagram of a set ofhpairwise disjoint convex splinegons with a total ofnvertices.", "authors": [{"name": "danny z chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314488448"}, {"name": "haitao wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81555944956"}], "title": "Computing Shortest Paths among Curved Obstacles in the Plane", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "214\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "214\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Mauritius", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of notre dame notre dame in", "city": "notre dame", "Name": "danny z chen"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "utah state university logan ut", "city": null, "Name": "haitao wang"}]}, "Article No.: 27": {"references": ["A.

Given some continuous, nondecreasing cost function, we aim to compute a schedule minimizing the weighted total cost, where the cost of each job is determined by the cost function value at its completion time. This problem is closely related to scheduling a single machine with nonuniform processing speed. We show that for piecewise linear cost functions it is strongly NP-hard. The main contribution of this article is a tight analysis of the approximation guarantee of Smith\u2019s rule under any convex or concave cost function. More specifically, for these wide classes of cost functions we reduce the task of determining a worst-case problem instance to a continuous optimization problem, which can be solved by standard algebraic or numerical methods. For polynomial cost functions with positive coefficients, it turns out that the tight approximation ratio can be calculated as the root of a univariate polynomial. We show that this approximation ratio is asymptotically equal tok(k\u2212 1)&sol;(k&plus; 1), denoting bykthe degree of the cost function. To overcome unrealistic worst-case instances, we also give tight bounds for the case of integral processing times that are parameterized by the maximum and total processing time.", "authors": [{"name": "wiebke hohn", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81484649197"}, {"name": "tobias jacobs", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453632373"}], "title": "On the Performance of Smith\u2019s Rule in Single-Machine Scheduling with Nonlinear Cost", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "188\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "188\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "germany", "university": "technische universitat berlin", "affiliation_string": "technische universitat berlin berlin germany", "city": "berlin", "Name": "wiebke hohn"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "nec laboratories europe heidelberg germany", "city": "heidelberg", "Name": "tobias jacobs"}]}, "Article No.: 29": {"references": ["P.

Thediscrete Fr\u00e9chet distanceis an analogous similarity measure, defined for two sequences ofmandnpoints, where the points are usually sampled from input curves. We consider a variant, called thediscrete Fr\u00e9chet distance with shortcuts, which captures the similarity between (sampled) curves in the presence of outliers. When shortcuts are allowed only in one noise-containing curve, we give a randomized algorithm that runs inO((m&plus;n)6&sol;5 &plus; &epsiv;) expected time, for any &epsiv; > 0. When shortcuts are allowed in both curves, we give anO((m2&sol;3n2&sol;3&plus;m&plus;n)log3(m&plus;n))-time deterministic algorithm.We also consider the semicontinuous Fr\u00e9chet distance with one-sided shortcuts, where we have a sequence ofmpoints and a polygonal curve ofnedges, and shortcuts are allowed only in the sequence. We show that this problem can be solved in randomized expected timeO((m&plus;n)2&sol;3m2&sol;3n1&sol;3log\u2009(m&plus;n)).Our techniques are novel and may find further applications. One of the main new technical results is: Given two sets of pointsAandBin the plane and an intervalI, we develop an algorithm that decides whether the number of pairs (x,y) \u2208A\u00d7Bwhose distance dist(x,y) is inIis less than some given thresholdL. The running time of this algorithm decreases asLincreases. In case there are more thanLpairs of points whose distance is inI, we can get a small sample of pairs that contain a pair at approximate median distance (i.e., we can approximately \u201cbisect\u201dI). We combine this procedure with additional ideas to search, with a small overhead, for the optimal one-sided Fr\u00e9chet distance with shortcuts, using a very fast decision procedure. We also show how to apply this technique for approximating distance selection (with respect to rank), and a somewhat more involved variant of this technique is used in the solution of the semicontinuous Fr\u00e9chet distance with one-sided shortcuts. In general, the new technique can be applied to optimization problems for which the decision procedure is very fast but standard techniques like parametric search makes the optimization algorithm substantially slower.", "authors": [{"name": "rinat ben avraham", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81464673328"}, {"name": "omrit filtser", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=88159350557"}, {"name": "haim kaplan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100155392"}, {"name": "matthew j katz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100411941"}, {"name": "micha sharir", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81410596192"}], "title": "The Discrete and Semicontinuous Fr\u00e9chet Distance with Shortcuts via Approximate Distance Counting and Selection", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "77\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "77\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "israel", "university": "tel aviv university", "affiliation_string": "tel aviv university tel aviv israel", "city": "tel aviv yafo", "Name": "rinat ben avraham"}, {"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ben-gurion university beer-sheva israel", "city": "beer-sheva", "Name": "omrit filtser"}, {"country": "israel", "university": "tel aviv university", "affiliation_string": "tel aviv university tel aviv israel", "city": "tel aviv yafo", "Name": "haim kaplan"}, {"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ben-gurion university beer-sheva israel", "city": "beer-sheva", "Name": "matthew j katz"}, {"country": "israel", "university": "tel aviv university", "affiliation_string": "tel aviv university tel aviv israel", "city": "tel aviv yafo", "Name": "micha sharir"}]}, "Article No.: 35": {"references": ["Amjad Aboud. 2008.

Notable are red-black trees, in which bottom-up rebalancing after an insertion or deletion takes O(1) amortized time and O(1) rotations worst-case. But the design space of balanced trees has not been fully explored. We continue the exploration. Our contributions are three: We systematically study the use ofranksandrank differencesto define height-based balance in binary trees. Different invariants on rank differences yield AVL trees, red-black trees, and other kinds of balanced trees. By relaxing AVL trees, we obtain a new kind of balanced binary tree, theweak AVL tree (wavl tree), whose properties we develop. Bottom-up rebalancing after an insertion or deletion takes O(1) amortized time and at most two rotations, improving the three or more rotations per deletion needed in all other kinds of balanced trees of which we are aware. The height bound of a wavl tree degrades gracefully from that of an AVL tree as the number of deletions increases and is never worse than that of a red-black tree. Wavl trees also support top-down, fixed look-ahead rebalancing in O(1) amortized time. Finally, we use exponential potential functions to prove that in wavl trees rebalancing steps occur exponentially infrequently in rank. Thus, most of the rebalancing is at the bottom of the tree, which is crucial in concurrent applications and in those in which rotations take time that depends on the subtree size.", "authors": [{"name": "bernhard haeupler", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413596441"}, {"name": "siddhartha sen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87059877157"}, {"name": "robert e tarjan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100645220"}], "title": "Rank-Balanced Trees", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "343\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "12\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "343\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united states", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university pa united states", "city": null, "Name": "bernhard haeupler"}, {"country": "United Kingdom", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research new york ny united states", "city": "york", "Name": "siddhartha sen"}, {"country": "united states", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "princeton university and intertrust technologies princeton nj united states", "city": null, "Name": "robert e tarjan"}]}, "Article No.: 28": {"references": ["Vineet Bafna , Piotr Berman , Toshihiro Fujito, A 2-Approximation Algorithm for the Undirected Feedback Vertex Set Problem, SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics, v.12 n.3, p.289-297, Sept. 1999[doi>10.1137/S0895480196305124]\n", "Ann Becker , Reuven Bar-Yehuda , Dan Geiger, Randomized algorithms for the loop cutset problem, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, v.12 n.1, p.219-234, February 2000\n", "Hans L.

The first fixed-parameter algorithm for FVS in undirected graphs appeared in a monograph of Mehlhorn in 1984. The fixed-parameter tractability (FPT) status of FVS in directed graphs was a long-standing open problem until Chen et al. (STOC \u201908, JACM \u201908) showed that it is fixed-parameter tractable by giving a 4kk&excl; \u00b7nO(1)time algorithm. There are two subset versions of this problems: We are given an additional subsetSof vertices (resp., edges), and we want to hit all cycles passing through a vertex ofS(resp., an edge ofS); the two variants are known to be equivalent in the parameterized sense. Recently, theSubsetFVS problem in undirected graphs was shown to be FPT by Cygan et al. (ICALP\u201911, SIDMA\u201913) and independently by Kakimura et al. (SODA \u201912). We generalize the result of Chen et al. (STOC \u201908, JACM \u201908) by showing that aSubsetFVS in directed graphs can be solved in time 2O(k3)&cdot;nO(1)(i.e., FPT parameterized by sizekof the solution). By our result, we complete the picture for FVS problems and their subset versions in undirected and directed graphs. The technique of random sampling of important separators was used by Marx and Razgon (STOC \u201911, SICOMP \u201914) to show thatUndirected Multicutis FPT, and it was generalized by Chitnis et al. (SODA \u201912, SICOMP \u201913) to directed graphs to show thatDirected Multiway Cutis FPT. In addition to proving the FPT of aDirected SubsetFVS, we reformulate the random sampling of important separators technique in an abstract way that can be used with a general family of transversal problems. We believe this general approach will be useful for showing the FPT of other problems in directed graphs. Moreover, we modify the probability distribution used in the technique to achieve better running time; in particular, this gives an improvement from 22O(k)to 2O(k2)in the parameter dependence of theDirected Multiway Cutalgorithm of Chitnis et al. (SODA \u201912, SICOMP \u201913).", "authors": [{"name": "rajesh chitnis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81493659782"}, {"name": "marek cygan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436599894"}, {"name": "mohammataghi hajiaghayi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100596923"}, {"name": "daniel marx", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100405701"}], "title": "Directed Subset Feedback Vertex Set Is Fixed-Parameter Tractable", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "111\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "111\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland college park md usa", "city": null, "Name": "rajesh chitnis"}, {"country": "poland", "university": "university of warsaw", "affiliation_string": "institute of informatics university of warsaw poland warszawa", "city": "warsaw", "Name": "marek cygan"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland college park md usa", "city": null, "Name": "mohammataghi hajiaghayi"}, {"country": "Hungary", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "institute for computer science and control hungarian academy of sciences mta sztaki budapest hungary", "city": "budapest", "Name": "daniel marx"}]}, "Article No.: 31": {"references": ["D.

Motivated by work in the database community on outsourcing database and data stream processing, we ask whether the space usage of such algorithms can be further reduced by enlisting a more powerful \u201chelper\u201d that canannotatethe stream as it is read. We do not wish to blindly trust the helper, so we require that the algorithm be convinced of having computed a correct answer. We show upper bounds that achieve a nontrivial tradeoff between the amount of annotation used and the space required to verify it. We also prove lower bounds on such tradeoffs, often nearly matching the upper bounds, via notions related to Merlin-Arthur communication complexity. Our results cover the classic data stream problems of selection, frequency moments, and fundamental graph problems such as triangle-freeness and connectivity. Our work is also part of a growing trend\u2014including recent studies of multipass streaming, read/write streams, and randomly ordered streams\u2014of asking more complexity-theoretic questions about data stream processing.

We present several protocols for concurrent migration that satisfy desirable properties such as being based only on local information and computation and the absence of global coordination or cooperation of agents.

In particular, the convergence time to a Nash equilibrium is only logarithmic inmand polynomial inn, where the polynomial depends on the graph structure. In addition, we show reduced convergence times to approximate Nash equilibria.

Agents move in synchronous rounds. Each agent has a different label. Up tofof the agents are Byzantine. We consider two levels of Byzantine behavior. A strongly Byzantine agent can choose an arbitrary port when it moves and it can convey arbitrary information to other agents, while a weakly Byzantine agent can do the same, except changing its label. What is the minimum number of good agents that guarantees deterministic gathering of all of them, with termination&quest; We solve exactly this Byzantine gathering problem in arbitrary networks for weakly Byzantine agents and give approximate solutions for strongly Byzantine agents, both when the size of the network is known and when it is unknown. It turns out that both the strength versus the weakness of Byzantine behavior and the knowledge of network size significantly impact the results.For weakly Byzantine agents, we show that any number of good agents permits solving the problem for networks of known size. If the size is unknown, then this minimum number isf&plus;2. More precisely, we show a deterministic polynomial algorithm that gathers all good agents in an arbitrary network, provided that there are at leastf&plus;2 of them. We also provide a matching lower bound: we prove that if the number of good agents is at mostf&plus;1, then they are not able to gather deterministically with termination in some networks.For strongly Byzantine agents, we give a lower bound off&plus;1, even when the graph is known: we show thatfgood agents cannot gather deterministically in the presence offByzantine agents even in a ring of known size.

In min-max generalization problems, the input consists of data items with weights and a lower boundwlb, and the goal is to partition individual items into groups of weight at leastwlbwhile minimizing the maximum weight of a group. The rules of legal partitioning are specific to a problem. Du et al. consider several problems in this vein: (1) partitioning a graph into connected subgraphs, (2) partitioning unstructured data into arbitrary classes, and (3) partitioning a two-dimensional array into contiguous rectangles (subarrays) that satisfy these weight requirements.We significantly improve approximation ratios for all the problems considered by Du et al. and provide additional motivation for these problems.

Kaplan, Shafrir, and Tarjan [SODA 2002] designed data structures for an extension of the union-find problem in which items of the sets maintained may be deleted. The cost of a delete operation in their implementations is essentially the same as the cost of a find operation; namely,O(logn) worst-case andO(\u03b1\u2308M/N\u2309(n)) amortized, wherenis the number of items in the set returned by the find operation,Nis the total number of makeset operations performed,Mis the total number of find operations performed, and \u03b1\u2308M/N\u2309(n) is a functional inverse of Ackermann\u2019s function. They left open the question whether delete operations can be implemented more efficiently than find operations, for example, ino(logn) worst-case time. We resolve this open problem by presenting a relatively simple modification of the classical union-find data structure that supports delete, as well as makeset and union operations, inconstantworst-case time, while still supporting find operations inO(logn) worst-case time andO(\u03b1\u2308 M/N\u2309(n)) amortized time.Our analysis supplies, in particular, a very concise potential-based amortized analysis of the standard union-find data structure that yields anO(\u03b1\u2308M/N\u2309(n)) amortized bound on the cost of find operations. All previous potential-based analyses yielded the weaker amortized bound ofO(\u03b1\u2308M/N\u2309(N)). Furthermore, our tighter analysis extends to one-path variants of the path compression technique such aspath splitting.", "authors": [{"name": "stephen alstrup", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100490145"}, {"name": "mikkel thorup", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81551310456"}, {"name": "inge li grtz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100550736"}, {"name": "theis rauhe", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100572761"}, {"name": "uri zwick", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100244628"}], "title": "Union-Find with Constant Time Deletions", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "70\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "139\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Denmark", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of copenhagen denmark", "city": "copenhagen", "Name": "stephen alstrup"}, {"country": "Denmark", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of copenhagen denmark", "city": "copenhagen", "Name": "mikkel thorup"}, {"country": "denmark", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "technical university of denmark", "city": null, "Name": "inge li grtz"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "uri zwick", "city": null, "Name": "theis rauhe"}]}, "Article No.: 1e": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2675311", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "aravind srinivasan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658646361"}], "title": "Editorial", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "39\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "66\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": []}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Isolde Adler, Marshals, monotone marshals, and hypertree-width, Journal of Graph Theory, v.47 n.4, p.275-296, December 2004[doi>10.1002/jgt.v47:4]\n", "Isolde Adler , Georg Gottlob , Martin Grohe, Hypertree width and related hypergraph invariants, European Journal of Combinatorics, v.28 n.8, p.2167-2181, November, 2007[doi>10.1016/j.ejc.2007.04.013]\n", "Noga Alon , Raphael Yuster , Uri Zwick, Color-coding, Journal of the ACM (JACM), v.42 n.4, p.844-856, July 1995[doi>10.1145/210332.210337]\n", "A.

Hence, identifying polynomial-time solvable classes of constraint satisfaction problems has received a lot of attention. In this article, we are interested in structural properties that can make the problem tractable. So far, the largest structural class that is known to be polynomial-time solvable is the class of bounded hypertree width instances introduced by Gottlob et al. [2002]. Here we identify a new class of polynomial-time solvable instances: those having bounded fractional edge cover number. Combining hypertree width and fractional edge cover number, we then introduce the notion of fractional hypertree width. We prove that constraint satisfaction problems with bounded fractional hypertree width can be solved in polynomial time (provided that the tree decomposition is given in the input). Together with a recent approximation algorithm for finding such decompositions [Marx 2010], it follows that bounded fractional hypertree width is now the most generally known structural property that guarantees polynomial-time solvability.", "authors": [{"name": "martin grohe", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81340489321"}, {"name": "daniel marx", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100405701"}], "title": "Constraint Solving via Fractional Edge Covers", "citations": [{"Name": "Cl\u00e9ment Carbonnel ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Martin C.

The decision was based on the strikingly good performance of Yaroslavskiy's implementation in running time experiments. At that time, no precise investigations of the algorithm were available to explain its superior performance\u2014on the contrary: previous theoretical studies of other dual-pivot Quicksort variants even discouraged the use of two pivots. In 2012, two of the authors gave an average case analysis of a simplified version of Yaroslavskiy's algorithm, proving that savings in the number of comparisons are possible. However, Yaroslavskiy's algorithm needs more swaps, which renders the analysis inconclusive.To force the issue, we herein extend our analysis to the fully detailed style of Knuth: we determine the exact number of executed Java Bytecode instructions. Surprisingly, Yaroslavskiy's algorithm needs sightly more Bytecode instructions than a simple implementation of classic Quicksort\u2014contradicting observed running times. As in Oracle's library implementation, we incorporate the use of Insertionsort on small subproblems and show that it indeed speeds up Yaroslavskiy's Quicksort in terms of Bytecodes; but even with optimal Insertionsort thresholds, the new Quicksort variant needs slightly more Bytecode instructions on average.Finally, we show that the (suitably normalized) costs of Yaroslavskiy's algorithm converge to a random variable whose distribution is characterized by a fixed-point equation. From that, we compute variances of costs and show that for largen, costs are concentrated around their mean.", "authors": [{"name": "sebastian wild", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81550527256"}, {"name": "markus e nebel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100373614"}, {"name": "ralph neininger", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100414699"}], "title": "Average Case and Distributional Analysis of Dual-Pivot Quicksort", "citations": [{"Name": "Sebastian Wild ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Markus E.

The compression is represented by straight-line programs (SLPs)\u2014that is, context-free grammars generating exactly one string; the termfullymeans that both the patternandthe text are given in the compressed form. The problem is approached using a recently developed technique of local recompression: the SLPs are refactored so that substrings of the pattern and text are encoded in both SLPs in the same way. To this end, the SLPs are locally decompressed and then recompressed in a uniform way.This technique yields anO((n&plus;m) logM) algorithm for compressed pattern matching, assuming thatMfits inO(1) machine words, wheren(m) is the size of the compressed representation of the text (pattern, respectively), andMis the size of the decompressed pattern. If onlym&plus;nfits inO(1) machine words, the running time increases toO((n&plus;m) logMlog (n&plus;m)).

Although these algorithms are well known, until now there have been only preliminary results on time complexity, even for the simplest link reversal algorithm for routing, called Full Reversal. In Full Reversal, a sink reverses all its incident links, whereas in other link reversal algorithms (e.g., Partial Reversal), a sink reverses only some of its incident links. Charron-Bost et al. introduced a generalization, called LR, that includes Full and Partial Reversal as special cases. In this article, we present an exact expression for the time complexity of LR. The expression is stated in terms of simple properties of the initial graph. The result specializes to exact formulas for the time complexity of any node in any initial acyclic directed graph for both Full and Partial Reversal. Having the exact formulas provides insight into the behavior of Full and Partial Reversal on specific graph families. Our first technical insight is to describe the behavior of Full Reversal as a dynamical system and to observe that this system is linear in min-plus algebra. Our second technical insight is to overcome the difficulty posed by the fact that LR is not linear by transforming every execution of LR from an initial graph into an execution of Full Reversal from a different initial graph while maintaining the execution's work and time complexity.", "authors": [{"name": "bernadette charron-bost", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100598240"}, {"name": "matthias fugger", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81322493853"}, {"name": "jennifer l welch", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452607782"}, {"name": "josef widder", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81335499668"}], "title": "Time Complexity of Link Reversal Routing", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "130\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "199\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "france", "university": "ecole polytechnique", "affiliation_string": "cnrs  lix ecole polytechnique palaiseau cedex france", "city": "palaiseau", "Name": "bernadette charron-bost"}, {"country": "austria", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "tu wien wien austria", "city": null, "Name": "matthias fugger"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "texas am university usa", "city": null, "Name": "jennifer l welch"}, {"country": "austria", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "tu wien wien austria", "city": null, "Name": "josef widder"}]}, "Article No.: 16": {"references": ["Stephen Alstrup , Jacob Holm , Kristian De Lichtenberg , Mikkel Thorup, Maintaining information in fully dynamic trees with top trees, ACM Transactions on Algorithms (TALG), v.1 n.2, p.243-264, October 2005[doi>10.1145/1103963.1103966]\n", "E.

The problem with one root and many sinks is as hard to approximate as the directed Steiner forest problem, and the latter is well known to be as hard to approximate as the label cover problem. Utilizing previous techniques, we strengthen these results and extend them to undirected graphs.

Many problems have been shown to admit polynomial kernels, but it is only recently that a framework for showing the nonexistence of polynomial kernels for specific problems has been developed by Bodlaender et al. [2009] and Fortnow and Santhanam [2008]. With few exceptions, all known kernelization lower bounds results have been obtained by directly applying this framework. In this article, we show how to combine these results with combinatorial reductions that use colors and IDs in order to prove kernelization lower bounds for a variety of basic problems. To follow we give a summary of our main results. All results are under the assumption that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse to the third level.\u2014We show that theSteiner Treeproblem parameterized by the number of terminals and solution sizek, and theConnected Vertex CoverandCapacitated Vertex Coverproblems do not admit a polynomial kernel. The two latter results are surprising because the closely relatedVertex Coverproblem admits a kernel with at most 2kvertices.\u2014Alon and Gutner [2008] obtain akpoly(h)kernel forDominating Set inH-Minor Free Graphsparameterized byh&equals; &verbar;H&verbar; and solution sizek, and ask whether kernels of smaller size exist. We partially resolve this question by showing thatDominating Set inH-Minor Free Graphsdoes not admit a kernel with size polynomial ink&plus;h.\u2014Harnik and Naor [2007] obtain a \u201ccompression algorithm\u201d for theSparse Subset Sumproblem. We show that their algorithm is essentially optimal by showing that the instances cannot be compressed further.\u2014TheHitting SetandSet Coverproblems are among the most-studied problems in algorithmics. Both problems admit a kernel of sizekO(d)when parameterized by solution sizekand maximum set sized. We show that neither of them, along with theUnique CoverageandBounded Rank Disjoint Setsproblems, admits a polynomial kernel.The existence of polynomial kernels for several of the problems mentioned previously was an open problem explicitly stated in the literature [Alon and Gutner 2008; Betzler 2006; Guo and Niedermeier 2007; Guo et al. 2007; Moser et al. 2007].

In general, these problems involve planning the coordinated motion of a collection of agents (representing robots, people, map labels, network messages, etc.) to achieve a global property in the network while minimizing the maximum or average movement (expended energy). The only previous theoretical results about this class of problems are about approximation and are mainly negative: many movement problems of interest have polynomial inapproximability. Given that the number of mobile agents is typically much smaller than the complexity of the environment, we turn to fixed-parameter tractability. We characterize the boundary between tractable and intractable movement problems in a very general setup: it turns out the complexity of the problem fundamentally depends on the treewidth of the minimal configurations. Thus, the complexity of a particular problem can be determined by answering a purely combinatorial question. Using our general tools, we determine the complexity of several concrete problems and fortunately show that many movement problems of interest can be solved efficiently.", "authors": [{"name": "erik d demaine", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100553346"}, {"name": "mohammadtaghi hajiaghayi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100596923"}, {"name": "daniel marx", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100405701"}], "title": "Minimizing Movement: Fixed-Parameter Tractability", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "41\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "114\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "mit computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory cambridge ma", "city": "cambridge", "Name": "erik d demaine"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland college park and att labs--research md", "city": null, "Name": "mohammadtaghi hajiaghayi"}, {"country": "Hungary", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "institute for computer science and control hungarian academy of sciences mta sztaki budapest hungary", "city": "budapest", "Name": "daniel marx"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["S.

It is known that this simple protocol succeeds in spreading a rumor from one vertex to all others withinO(logn) rounds on complete graphs, hypercubes, random regular graphs, Erd&odblac;s-R\u00e9nyi random graphs, and Ramanujan graphs with probability 1 \u2212o(1). In the quasirandom model, we assume that each vertex has a (cyclic) list of its neighbors. Once informed, it starts at a random position on the list, but from then on informs its neighbors in the order of the list.

This motivates the game-theoretic study of network formation, and our article considers one of the most well-studied models, originally proposed by Fabrikant et al. In the model, each ofnagents corresponds to a vertex, which can create edges to other vertices at a cost of \u03b1 each, for some parameter \u03b1. Every edge can be freely used by every vertex, regardless of who paid the creation cost. To reflect the desire to be close to other vertices, each agent\u2019s cost function is further augmented by the sum total of all (graph-theoretic) distances to all other vertices.Previous research proved that for many regimes of the (\u03b1,n) parameter space, the total social cost (sum of all agents\u2019 costs) of every Nash equilibrium is bounded by at most a constant multiple of the optimal social cost. In algorithmic game-theoretic nomenclature, this approximation ratio is called the price of anarchy. In our article, we significantly sharpen some of those results, proving that for all constant nonintegral \u03b1 > 2, the price of anarchy is in fact 1 +o(1); that is, not only is it bounded by a constant, but also it tends to 1 asn\u2192 \u221e. For constant integral \u03b1 &ges; 2, we show that the price of anarchy is bounded away from 1. We provide quantitative estimates on the rates of convergence for both results.", "authors": [{"name": "ronald graham", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81326489494"}, {"name": "linus hamilton", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658983709"}, {"name": "ariel levavi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453652815"}, {"name": "po-shen loh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81385596649"}], "title": "Anarchy Is Free in Network Creation", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "45\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "19\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "45\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Mali", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california san diego la jolla ca", "city": "san", "Name": "ronald graham"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa", "city": "pittsburgh", "Name": "linus hamilton"}, {"country": "Mali", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california san diego la jolla ca", "city": "san", "Name": "ariel levavi"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa", "city": "pittsburgh", "Name": "po-shen loh"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Deepak Ajwani , Tobias Friedrich, Average-case analysis of online topological ordering, Proceedings of the 18th international conference on Algorithms and computation, December 17-19, 2007, Sendai, Japan\n", "Deepak Ajwani , Tobias Friedrich , Ulrich Meyer, AnO(n2.75)algorithm for online topological ordering, Proceedings of the 10th Scandinavian conference on Algorithm Theory, July 06-08, 2006, Riga, Latvia[doi>10.1007/11785293_8]\n", "Deepak Ajwani , Tobias Friedrich , Ulrich Meyer, AnO(n2.75) algorithm for incremental topological ordering, ACM Transactions on Algorithms (TALG), v.4 n.4, p.1-14, August 2008[doi>10.1145/1383369.1383370]\n", "Bowen Alpern , Roger Hoover , Barry K.

This yields two subproblems: (1) computing the start-stop diagram, and (2) finding the optimal segmentation for a given diagram. We show that (2) is NP-hard in general. However, we identify properties of the start-stop diagram that make the problem tractable and give a polynomial-time algorithm for this case.We study two concrete nonmonotone criteria that arise in practical applications in more detail. Both are based on a given univariate attribute functionfover the domain of the trajectory. We say a segment satisfies anoutlier-tolerant criterionif the value offlies within a certain range for at least a given percentage of the length of the segment. We say a segment satisfies astandard deviation criterionif the standard deviation offover the length of the segment lies below a given threshold. We show that both criteria satisfy the properties that make the segmentation problem tractable. In particular, we compute an optimal segmentation of a trajectory based on the outlier-tolerant criterion inO(n2logn+kn2) time and on the standard deviation criterion inO(kn2) time, wherenis the number of vertices of the input trajectory andkis the number of segments in an optimal solution.", "authors": [{"name": "boris aronov", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100554721"}, {"name": "anne driemel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81464673273"}, {"name": "marc van kreveld", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100427803"}, {"name": "maarten loffler", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81325489329"}, {"name": "frank staals", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81493660306"}], "title": "Segmentation of Trajectories on Nonmonotone Criteria", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "37\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "37\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "polytechnic institute of nyu", "city": null, "Name": "boris aronov"}, {"country": "Netherlands", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "tu eindhoven mb eindhoven the netherlands", "city": "eindhoven", "Name": "anne driemel"}, {"country": "netherlands", "university": "utrecht university", "affiliation_string": "utrecht university tb utrecht the netherlands", "city": "utrecht", "Name": "marc van kreveld"}, {"country": "netherlands", "university": "utrecht university", "affiliation_string": "utrecht university tb utrecht the netherlands", "city": "utrecht", "Name": "maarten loffler"}, {"country": "netherlands", "university": "utrecht university", "affiliation_string": "utrecht university", "city": "utrecht", "Name": "frank staals"}]}, "Article No.: 18": {"references": ["Thomas H.

This can be done in different ways, giving rise to different algorithms. Recently, a dual-pivot algorithm due to Yaroslavskiy received much attention, because it replaced the well-engineered quicksort algorithm in Oracle\u2019s Java 7 runtime library. Nebel and Wild (ESA 2012) analyzed this algorithm and showed that on average it uses 1.9nlnn+O(n) comparisons to sort an input of sizen, beating standard quicksort, which uses 2nlnn+O(n) comparisons. We introduce a model that captures all dual-pivot algorithms, give a unified analysis, and identify new dual-pivot algorithms that minimize the average number of key comparisons among all possible algorithms up to a linear term. This minimum is 1.8nlnn+O(n). For the case that the pivots are chosen from a small sample, we include a comparison of dual-pivot quicksort and classical quicksort. Specifically, we show that dual-pivot quicksort benefits from a skewed choice of pivots. We experimentally evaluate our algorithms and compare them to Yaroslavskiy\u2019s algorithm and the recently described 3-pivot quicksort algorithm of Kushagra et al.

Its input consists of a set of PQ-trees, which represent sets of circular orders of their leaves, together with a set of child-parent relations between these PQ-trees, such that the leaves of the child form a subset of the leaves of the parent. SimultaneousPQ-Orderingasks whether orders of the leaves of each of the trees can be chosensimultaneously; that is, for every child-parent relation, the order chosen for the parent is an extension of the order chosen for the child. We show that SimultaneousPQ-OrderingisNP-complete in general, and we identify a family of instances that can be solved efficiently, the2-fixed instances. We show that this result serves as a framework for several other problems that can be formulated as instances of SimultaneousPQ-Ordering. In particular, we give linear-time algorithms for recognizing simultaneous interval graphs and extending partial interval representations. Moreover, we obtain a linear-time algorithm for PartiallyPQ-ConstrainedPlanarityfor biconnected graphs, which asks for a planar embedding in the presence of PQ-trees that restrict the possible orderings of edges around vertices, and a quadratic-time algorithm for SimultaneousEmbedding withFixedEdgesfor biconnected graphs with a connected intersection. Both results can be extended to the case where the input graphs are not necessarily biconnected but have the property that each cutvertex is contained in at most two nontrivial blocks.

This model is inspired by both imprecision in human judgment of values and also by bounded but potentially adversarial errors in the outcomes of sporting tournaments. Our model is closely related to a number of models commonly considered in the psychophysics literature where \u03b4 corresponds to theJust Noticeable Difference (JND) unitordifference threshold. In experimental psychology, the method of paired comparisons was proposed as a means for ranking preferences amongnelements of a human subject. The method requires performing all (n2) comparisons, then sorting elements according to the number of wins. The large number of comparisons is performed to counter the potentially faulty decision-making of the human subject, who acts as an imprecise comparator. We show that in our model the method of paired comparisons has optimal accuracy, minimizing the errors introduced by the imprecise comparisons. However, it is also wasteful because it requires all (n2). We show that the same optimal guarantees can be achieved using 4n3/2comparisons, and we prove the optimality of our method. We then explore the general tradeoff between the guarantees on the error that can be made and number of comparisons for the problems of sorting, max-finding, and selection. Our results provide strong lower bounds and close-to-optimal solutions for each of these problems.", "authors": [{"name": "miklos ajtai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100042672"}, {"name": "vitaly feldman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100064301"}, {"name": "avinatan hassidim", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100303802"}, {"name": "jelani nelson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81758974357"}], "title": "Sorting and Selection with Imprecise Comparisons", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "94\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "20\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "94\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm research - almaden ca usa", "city": null, "Name": "miklos ajtai"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm research - almaden ca usa", "city": null, "Name": "vitaly feldman"}, {"country": "israel", "university": "bar ilan university", "affiliation_string": "bar ilan university israel", "city": "ramat gan", "Name": "avinatan hassidim"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "harvard university usa", "city": null, "Name": "jelani nelson"}]}, "Article No.: 25": {"references": ["Ingo Alth\u00f6fer , Gautam Das , David Dobkin , Deborah Joseph , Jos\u00e9 Soares, On sparse spanners of weighted graphs, Discrete & Computational Geometry, v.9 n.1, p.81-100, 1993[doi>10.1007/BF02189308]\n", "Sanjeev Arora , Carsten Lund, Hardness of approximations, Approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems, PWS Publishing Co., Boston, MA, 1996\n", "Sanjeev Arora , Carsten Lund , Rajeev Motwani , Madhu Sudan , Mario Szegedy, Proof verification and the hardness of approximation problems, Journal of the ACM (JACM), v.45 n.3, p.501-555, May 1998[doi>10.1145/278298.278306]\n", "Sanjeev Arora , Shmuel Safra, Probabilistic checking of proofs: a new characterization of NP, Journal of the ACM (JACM), v.45 n.1, p.70-122, Jan. 1998[doi>10.1145/273865.273901]\n", "Baruch Awerbuch, Alan Baratz, and David Peleg. 1992.

A similar theorem was claimed by Elkin and Peleg [2000] as part of an attempt to prove hardness for the basick-spanner problem, but their proof was later found to have a fundamental error. Thus, we give boththe firstnontrivial lower bound for the problem of Label Cover with large girth as well as the first full proof of strong hardness for the basick-spanner problem, which is both the simplest problem in graph spanners and one of the few for which super-logarithmic hardness was not known. AssumingNP&subseteq;BPTIME(2polylog(n), we show (roughly) that for everyk&ges; 3 and every constant &epsi; > 0, it is hard to approximate the basick-spanner problem within a factor better than 2log1-&epsi;n)/k. This improves over the previous best lower bound of only \u03a9(logn)/kfrom Kortsarz [2001].

We begin with an explanation of why this poset structure is common. We show any family of setsFthat can be defined by a \u201clabelling algorithm\u201d (e.g., the Ford-Fulkerson labelling algorithm for maximum network flow) has an algorithm that constructs the minset poset forF. We implement this algorithm to efficiently find the nodes of the poset whenFis the family of minimum edge cuts of an unweighted graph; we also give related algorithms to construct the entire poset for weighted graphs. The rest of the article discusses applications to edge- and vertex connectivity, both combinatorial and algorithmic, that we now describe.For digraphs, a natural interpretation of the minset poset represents all minimum edge cuts. In the special case of undirected graphs, the minset poset is proved to be a variant of the well-known cactus representation of all mincuts. We use the poset algorithms to construct the cactus representation for unweighted graphs in timeO(m+\u03bb2nlog (n/\u03bb)) (\u03bb is the edge connectivity) improving the previous boundO(\u03bbn2) for all but the densest graphs. We also construct the cactus representation for weighted graphs in timeO(nmlog(n2/m)), the same bound as a previously known algorithm but in linear spaceO(m). The latter bound also holds for constructing the minset poset for any weighted digraph; the former bound also holds for constructing the nodes of that poset for any unweighted digraph. The poset is used in algorithms to increase the edge connectivity of a graph by adding the fewest edges possible. For directed and undirected graphs, weighted and unweighted, we achieve the time of the preceding two bounds, i.e., essentially the best-known bounds to compute the edge connectivity itself. Some constructions of minset posets for graph rigidity are also sketched.For vertex connectivity, the minset poset is proved to be a slight variant of the dominator tree. This leads to an algorithm to construct the dominator tree in timeO(m) on a RAM. (The algorithm is included in the appendix, since other linear-time algorithms of similar simplicity have recently been presented.)", "authors": [{"name": "harold n gabow", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100225841"}], "title": "The Minset-Poset Approach to Representations of Graph Connectivity", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "27\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "27\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado at boulder boulder co", "city": null, "Name": "harold n gabow"}]}, "Article No.: 17": {"references": ["Ittai Abraham , Ofer Neiman, Using petal-decompositions to build a low stretch spanning tree, Proceedings of the forty-fourth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing, May 19-22, 2012, New York, New York, USA[doi>10.1145/2213977.2214015]\n", "Dimitris Achlioptas, Database-friendly random projections: Johnson-Lindenstrauss with binary coins, Journal of Computer and System Sciences, v.66 n.4, p.671-687, 1 June 2003[doi>10.1016/S0022-0000(03)00025-4]\n", "Andr\u00e1s A.

This result partially extends previous meta-theorems on the existence of linear kernels on graphs of bounded genus andH-minor-free graphs. LetFbe a fixed finite family of graphs containing at least one planar graph. Given ann-vertex graphGand a non-negative integerk, Planar-F-Deletionasks whetherGhas a setX\u2286V(G) such that &verbar;X&verbar; &les;kandG\u2212XisH-minor-free for everyH&epsi;F. As our second application, we present the firstsingle-exponentialalgorithm to solve Planar-F-Deletion. Namely, our algorithm runs in time 2O(k)\u00b7n2, which is asymptotically optimal with respect tok. So far, single-exponential algorithms were only known for special cases of the familyF.", "authors": [{"name": "eun jung kim", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384605964"}, {"name": "alexander langer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413598350"}, {"name": "christophe paul", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100339786"}, {"name": "felix reidl", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81488672481"}, {"name": "peter rossmanith", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100217965"}, {"name": "ignasi sau", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436596526"}, {"name": "somnath sikdar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81336492963"}], "title": "Linear Kernels and Single-Exponential Algorithms Via Protrusion Decompositions", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "30\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "17\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "30\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cnrs lamsade paris", "city": null, "Name": "eun jung kim"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "rwth aachen university aachen germany", "city": "aachen", "Name": "alexander langer"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "felix reidl", "city": null, "Name": "christophe paul"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "christophe paul", "city": null, "Name": "rwth aachen university aachen germany"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "christophe paul", "city": null, "Name": "rwth aachen university aachen germany"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "rwth aachen university aachen germany", "city": "aachen", "Name": "somnath sikdar"}]}}, "date": {"month": "February", "year": "2016"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Ajit Agrawal , Philip Klein , R.

We show anO(klog3/2r)-approximation algorithm for EC-kRC with uniform edge weights, and several polylogarithmic bi-criteria approximation algorithms for EC-kRC and VC-kRC, where the connectivity requirementkis violated by a constant factor. We complement these upper bounds by proving that VC-kRC is hard to approximate to within a factor ofk&epsi;for some fixed &epsi; > 0. We then turn to study a simpler version of VC-kRC, where only one source-sink pair is present. We give a simple bi-criteria approximation algorithm for this case, and show evidence that even this restricted version of the problem may be hard to approximate.

One can formally prove that the program is correct, but this may be beyond the power of existing methods. Alternatively, one can check that the output produced for a particular input satisfies the desired input--output relation by running a checker on the input--output pair. Then one only needs to prove the correctness of the checker. For some problems, however, even such a checker may be too complicated to formally verify. There is a third alternative: augment the original program to produce not only an output but also acorrectness certificate, with the property that a very simple program (whose correctness is easy to prove) can use the certificate to verify that the input--output pair satisfies the desired input--output relation.We consider the following important instance of this general question: How does one verify that the dominator tree of a flow graph is correct? Existing fast algorithms for finding dominators are complicated, and even verifying the correctness of a dominator tree in the absence of additional information seems complicated. We define a correctness certificate for a dominator tree, show how to use it to easily verify the correctness of the tree, and show how to augment fast dominator-finding algorithms so that they produce a correctness certificate. We also relate the dominator certificate problem to the problem of finding divergent spanning trees in a flow graph, and we develop algorithms to find such trees. All our algorithms run in linear time. Previous algorithms apply just to the special case of only trivial dominators, and they take at least quadratic time.", "authors": [{"name": "loukas georgiadis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100307645"}, {"name": "robert e tarjan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100645220"}], "title": "Dominator Tree Certification and Divergent Spanning Trees", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "60\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "22\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "60\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "greece", "university": "university of ioannina", "affiliation_string": "university of ioannina greece", "city": "ioannina", "Name": "loukas georgiadis"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "princeton university and intertrust technologies princeton nj", "city": null, "Name": "robert e tarjan"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["N.

While fornoneof these results a reverse reduction to Unique Games is known, the assumption of bijective projections in the Label Cover instance nevertheless seems critical in these proofs. In this work, we bypass the need for UGC assumption in inapproximability results for two geometric problems, obtaining a tight NP-hardness result in each case.The first problem, known asLpSubspace Approximation, is a generalization of the classic least squares regression problem. Here, the input consists of a set of pointsX&equals; &lcub;\u03b11, \u2026 , \u03b1m&rcub; \u2286 Rnand a parameterk(possibly depending onn). The goal is to find a subspaceHofRnof dimensionkthat minimizes the &ell;pnorm of the Euclidean distances to the points inX. Forp&equals; 2,k&equals;n\u2212 1, this reduces to the least squares regression problem, while forp&equals; \u221e,k&equals; 0 it reduces to the problem of finding a ball of minimum radius enclosing all the points. We show that for any fixedp\u2208 (2, \u221e), and fork&equals;n\u2212 1, it is NP-hard to approximate this problem to within a factor of \u03b3p\u2212 &epsi; for constant &epsi; > 0, where \u03b3pis thepth norm of a standard Gaussian random variable. This matches the \u03b3papproximation algorithm obtained by Deshpande, Tulsiani, and Vishnoi who also showed the same hardness result under the UGC.The second problem we study is the relatedLpQuadratic Grothendieck Maximization Problem, considered by Kindler, Naor, and Schechtman. Here, the input is a multilinear quadratic form \u2211ni,j&equals; 1aijxixjand the goal is to maximize the quadratic form over the &ell;punit ball, namely, allxwith \u2211ni&equals; 1&verbar;xi&verbar;p&les; 1. The problem is polynomial time solvable forp&equals; 2. We show that for any constantp\u2208 (2, \u221e), it is NP-hard to approximate the quadratic form to within a factor of \u03b32p\u2212 &epsi; for any &epsi; > 0. The same hardness factor was shown under the UGC by Kindler et al. We also obtain a \u03b32p-approximation algorithm for the problem using the convex relaxation of the problem defined by Kindler et al. A \u03b32papproximation algorithm has also been independently obtained by Naor and Schechtman.These are thefirstapproximation thresholds, proven under P \u2260 NP, that involve the Gaussian random variable in a fundamental way.

A common form of this is spectral sparsification, which involves removing and reweighting the edges of the graph while approximately preserving its spectral properties. This task has a more general linear algebraic formulation in terms of approximating sums of rank-one matrices. This article considers a more general task of approximating sums of symmetric, positive semidefinite matrices of arbitrary rank. We present two deterministic, polynomial time algorithms for solving this problem. The first algorithm applies the pessimistic estimators of Wigderson and Xiao, and the second involves an extension of the method of Batson, Spielman, and Srivastava.

Given a pointxin a domainX, thesystolic feature sizeofXatxmeasures half the length of the shortest loop throughxthat is not null-homotopic inX. The resort to an intrinsic metric makes the systolic feature size rather insensitive to the local geometry of the domain, in contrast with its predecessors (local feature size, weak feature size, homology feature size). This reduces the number of samples required to capture the topology ofX, provided that a reliable approximation to the intrinsic metric ofXis available. Under sufficient sampling conditions involving the systolic feature size, we show that the geodesic Delaunay triangulationDx(L) of a finite samplingLis homotopy equivalent toX. Under similar conditions,Dx(L) is sandwiched between the geodesic witness complexCWX(L) and a relaxed versionCWX,\u03bd(L). In the conference version of the article, we took advantage of this fact and proved that the homology ofDx(L) (and hence the one ofX) can be retrieved by computing the persistent homology betweenCWX(L) andCWX,\u03bd(L). Here, we investigate further and show that the homology ofXcan also be recovered from the persistent homology associated with inclusions of typeCWX,\u03bd(L)&rarrhk;CWX,\u03bd\u2032(L), under some conditions on the parameters \u03bd\u2264\u03bd\u2032. Similar results are obtained for Vietoris-Rips complexes in the intrinsic metric. The proofs draw some connections with recent advances on the front of homology inference from point cloud data, but also with several well-known concepts of Riemannian (and even metric) geometry. On the algorithmic front, we propose algorithms for estimating the systolic feature size of a bounded planar domainX, selecting a landmark set of sufficient density, and computing the homology ofXusing geodesic witness complexes or Rips complexes.", "authors": [{"name": "steve y oudot", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100275407"}, {"name": "leonidas j guibas", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452606669"}, {"name": "jie gao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81328488602"}, {"name": "yue wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81318496805"}], "title": "Geodesic delaunay triangulations in bounded planar domains", "citations": [{"Name": "Tamal K.

In thereplacement pathsproblem we are required to compute for every edgeeinP, the length of a shortest path fromstotthat avoidse. The fastest known algorithm for solving the problem in weighted directed graphs is the trivial one: each edge inPis removed from the graph in its turn and the distance fromstotin the modified graph is computed. The running time of this algorithm isO(m n+n2logn), wheren&equals; &vert;V(G)&vert; andm&equals; &vert;E(G)&vert;.The replacement paths problem is strongly motivated by two different applications. First, the fastest algorithm to compute thek simple shortest pathsfromstotin directed graphs [Yen 1971; Lawler 1972] repeatedly computes the replacement paths fromstot. Its running time isO(kn(m+nlogn)). Second, the computation ofVickrey pricingof edges in distributed networks can be reduced to the replacement paths problem. An open question raised by Nisan and Ronen [2001] asks whether it is possible to compute the Vickrey pricing faster than the trivial algorithm described in the previous paragraph.In this article we present a near-linear time algorithm for computing replacement paths in weightedplanardirected graphs. In particular, the algorithm computes the lengths of the replacement paths inO(nlog3n) time (recall that in planar graphsm&equals;O(n)). This result immediately improves the running time of the two applications mentioned before by almost a linear factor. Our algorithm is obtained by combining several new ideas with a data structure of Klein [2005] that supports multisource shortest paths queries in planar directed graphs in logarithmic time.Our algorithm can be adapted to address the variant of the problem in which one is interested in the replacement path itself (rather than the length of the path). In that case the algorithm is executed in a preprocessing stage constructing a data structure that supports replacement path queries in time \u00d5 (h), wherehis the number of hops in the replacement path. In addition, we can handle the variant in which vertices should be avoided instead of edges.", "authors": [{"name": "yuval emek", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100013245"}, {"name": "david peleg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100569948"}, {"name": "liam roditty", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100647832"}], "title": "A near-linear-time algorithm for computing replacement paths in planar directed graphs", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "18\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "353\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft israel rd center herzlia israel", "city": "israel", "Name": "yuval emek"}, {"country": "israel", "university": "weizmann institute of science", "affiliation_string": "weizmann institute of science rehovot israel", "city": "rehovot", "Name": "david peleg"}, {"country": "israel", "university": "bar ilan university", "affiliation_string": "bar ilan university ramat gan israel", "city": "ramat gan", "Name": "liam roditty"}]}, "Article No.: 66": {"references": ["Noga Alon , Yossi Matias , Mario Szegedy, The space complexity of approximating the frequency moments, Proceedings of the twenty-eighth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing, p.20-29, May 22-24, 1996, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA[doi>10.1145/237814.237823]\n", "Babai, L., Gal, A., Kimmel, P., and Lokam, S. 1996.

For truly massive datasets, however, even making a single pass over the data is prohibitive. Therefore, streaming computations must be distributed over many machines. In practice, obtaining significant speedups using distributed computation has numerous challenges including synchronization, load balancing, overcoming processor failures, and data distribution. Successful systems in practice such as Google's MapReduce and Apache's Hadoop address these problems by only allowing acertain classof highly distributable tasks defined by local computations that can be applied in any order to the input.The fundamental question that arises is: How does the class of computational tasks supported by these systems differ from the class for which streaming solutions exist&quest;We introduce a simple algorithmic model for massive, unordered, distributed (mud) computation, as implemented by these systems. We show that in principle, mud algorithms are equivalent in power to symmetric streaming algorithms. More precisely, we show that any symmetric (order-invariant) function that can be computed by a streaming algorithm can also be computed by a mud algorithm, with comparable space and communication complexity. Our simulation uses Savitch's theorem and therefore has superpolynomial time complexity. We extend our simulation result to some natural classes of approximate and randomized streaming algorithms. We also give negative results, using communication complexity arguments to prove that extensions to private randomness, promise problems, and indeterminate functions are impossible. We also introduce an extension of the mud model to multiple keys and multiple rounds.", "authors": [{"name": "jon feldman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100065066"}, {"name": "s muthukrishnan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350571838"}, {"name": "anastasios sidiropoulos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100633398"}, {"name": "cliff stein", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332529763"}, {"name": "zoya svitkina", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350574398"}], "title": "On distributing symmetric streaming computations", "citations": [{"Name": "Florent Becker ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Adrian Kosowski ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nicolas Nisse ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ivan Rapaport ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Karol Suchan", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Florent Becker ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Adrian Kosowski ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Martin Matamala ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nicolas Nisse ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ivan Rapaport ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Karol Suchan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ioan Todinca", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gianmarco De Francisci Morales", "Country": "brazil", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michael T.

A customer presents a starting station and demands a route with perhaps several train connections taking him to his destination as early as possible. The booking office must find the best route for its customers. This problem was first considered in the theory of algorithms by Minty [1958], who reduced it to a problem on directed edge-weighted graphs: find a path from a given source to a given target such that the consecutive weights on the path are nondecreasing and the last weight on the path is minimized. Minty gave the first algorithm for the single-source version of the problem, in which one finds minimum last weight nondecreasing paths from the source to every other vertex.

We consider several variants of this problem. First, we extend the notion of Hausdorff distance from sets of points to sets of balls, so that each ball has to be matched with the nearest ball in the other set. We also consider the problem in the standard setting, by computing the Hausdorff distance between the unions of the two sets (as point sets). Second, we consider either all possible translationst(as is the standard approach), or consider only translations that keep the balls ofA+tdisjoint from those ofB. We propose several exact and approximation algorithms for these problems. In the second part of the article, we note that the Hausdorff distance is sensitive to outliers, and thus consider two variants that are more robust: the root-mean-square (rms) and the summed Hausdorff distance. We propose efficient approximation algorithms for computing the minimum rms and the minimum summed Hausdorff distances under translation, between two point sets in Rd. In order to obtain a fast algorithm for the summed Hausdorff distance, we propose a deterministic efficient dynamic data structure for maintaining an &epsis;-approximation of the 1-median of a set of points in Rd, under insertions and deletions.", "authors": [{"name": "pankaj k agarwal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100634961"}, {"name": "sariel har-peled", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100102298"}, {"name": "micha sharir", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81410596192"}, {"name": "yusu wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81464647321"}], "title": "Hausdorff distance under translation for points and balls", "citations": [{"Name": "Pankaj K.

An additional ingredient of the input is an online sequence of requests, each of which is characterized by a destination in the given metric space; whenever a request arrives, it must be stored in the sorting buffer. At any point in time, a currently pending request can be served by drawing it out of the buffer and moving the server to its corresponding destination. The objective is to serve all input requests in a way that minimizes the total distance traveled by the server.In this article, we focus our attention on instances of the problem in which the underlying metric is either anevenly-spaced line metricor acontinuous line metric. Our main findings can be briefly summarized as follows.(1) We present adeterministicO(logn)-competitive algorithm forn-point evenly-spaced line metrics. This result improves on a randomizedO(log2n)-competitive algorithm due to Khandekar and Pandit [2006b]. It also refutes their conjecture, stating that a deterministic strategy is unlikely to obtain a nontrivial competitive ratio.(2) We devise adeterministicO(logNlog logN)-competitive algorithm for continuous line metrics, whereNdenotes the length of the input sequence. In this context, we introduce a novel discretization technique of independent interest.(3) We establish the first nontrivial lower bound for the evenly-spaced case, by proving that the competitive ratio of any deterministic algorithm is at least 2 + &sqrt;3/&sqrt;3 &ap; 2.154. This result settles, to some extent, an open question due to Khandekar and Pandit [2006b], who posed the task of attaining lower bounds on the achievable competitive ratio as a foundational objective for future research.", "authors": [{"name": "iftah gamzu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384605606"}, {"name": "danny segev", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323495647"}], "title": "Improved online algorithms for the sorting buffer problem on line metrics", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "14\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "221\n", "Citation Count": "4\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "tel-aviv university isrel", "city": null, "Name": "iftah gamzu"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "massachusetts institute of technology cambridge ma", "city": "cambridge", "Name": "danny segev"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Susanne Albers , Hiroshi Fujiwara, Energy-efficient algorithms for flow time minimization, ACM Transactions on Algorithms (TALG), v.3 n.4, p.49-es, November 2007[doi>10.1145/1290672.1290686]\n", "Nikhil Bansal , Tracy Kimbrel , Kirk Pruhs, Speed scaling to manage energy and temperature, Journal of the ACM (JACM), v.54 n.1, p.1-39, March 2007[doi>10.1145/1206035.1206038]\n", "Nikhil Bansal , Kirk Pruhs , Cliff Stein, Speed scaling for weighted flow time, Proceedings of the eighteenth annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithms, p.805-813, January 07-09, 2007, New Orleans, Louisiana\n", "S.

Specifically, we consider a processor that can vary its speed between 0 and a maximum speedTto minimize its energy usage (the rate is believed to be a cubic function of the speed). As the speed is upper bounded, the processor may be overloaded with jobs and no scheduling algorithms can guarantee to meet the deadlines of all jobs. An optimal schedule is expected to maximize the throughput, and furthermore, its energy usage should be the smallest among all schedules that achieve the maximum throughput. In designing a scheduling algorithm, one has to face the dilemma of selecting more jobs and being conservative in energy usage. If we ignore energy usage, the best possible online algorithm is 4-competitive on throughput [Koren and Shasha 1995]. On the other hand, existing work on energy-efficient scheduling focuses on a setting where the processor speed is unbounded and the concern is on minimizing the energy to complete all jobs;O(1)-competitive online algorithms with respect to energy usage have been known [Yao et al. 1995; Bansal et al. 2007a; Li et al. 2006]. This article presents the first online algorithm for the more realistic setting where processor speed is bounded and the system may be overloaded; the algorithm isO(1)-competitive on both throughput and energy usage. If the maximum speed of the online scheduler is relaxed slightly to (1+&epsis;)Tfor some &epsis; > 0, we can improve the competitive ratio on throughput to arbitrarily close to one, while maintainingO(1)-competitiveness on energy usage.", "authors": [{"name": "ho-leung chan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435598035"}, {"name": "joseph wun-tat chan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81406599313"}, {"name": "tak-wah lam", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100237467"}, {"name": "lap-kei lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309481316"}, {"name": "kin-sum mak", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81336491297"}, {"name": "prudence w h wong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100189026"}], "title": "Optimizing throughput and energy in online deadline scheduling", "citations": [{"Name": "Susanne Albers ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Antonios Antoniadis", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xin Han ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tak-Wah Lam ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lap-Kei Lee ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Isaac K.

This way the application can distribute data using one of its available multicast channels or by sending one or more unicast transmissions. In such a model the utilization of the multicast channels is critical for the overall performance of the system.We study the scheduling algorithm of the sender in such a model. We describe this scheduling problem as an optimization problem where the objective is to maximize the utilization of the multicast channel. Our model captures the fact that it may be beneficial to multicast an object more than once (e.g., page update). Thus, the benefit depends, among other things, on the last time the object was sent, which makes the problem much more complex than previous related scheduling problems. We show that our problem is NP-hard. Then, using thelocal ratio techniquewe obtain a 4-approximation algorithm for the case where the objects are of fixed size and a 10-approximation algorithm for the general case. We also consider a special case which may be of practical interest, and prove that a simple greedy algorithm is a 3-approximation algorithm in this case.", "authors": [{"name": "rami cohen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81363601168"}, {"name": "dror rawitz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100541025"}, {"name": "danny raz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100300447"}], "title": "Time-dependent multi-scheduling of multicast", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "9\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "201\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "technion haifa israel", "city": "haifa", "Name": "rami cohen"}, {"country": "israel", "university": "tel aviv university", "affiliation_string": "tel aviv university tel-aviv israel", "city": "tel aviv yafo", "Name": "dror rawitz"}, {"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "technion haifa israel", "city": "haifa", "Name": "danny raz"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Milton Abramowitz, Handbook of Mathematical Functions, With Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables,, Dover Publications, Incorporated, 1974\n", "Aragon, C.

In this framework, we call a data structure resilient if it is able to operate correctly (at least) on the set of uncorrupted values. We present a resilient dictionary, implementing search, insert, and delete operations. Our dictionary hasO(logn+ \u03b4) expected amortized time per operation, andO(n) space complexity, wherendenotes the current number of keys in the dictionary. We also describe a deterministic resilient dictionary, with the same amortized cost per operation over a sequence of at least \u03b4&epsis;operations, where &epsis; > 0 is an arbitrary constant.

The task of minimizing the jitter is done by jitter regulators that use a limited-size buffer in order to shape the traffic. In many real-life situations regulators must handle multiple streams simultaneously and provide low jitter on each of them separately. Moreover, communication links have limited capacity, and these may pose further restrictions on the choices made by the regulator. This article investigates the problem of minimizing jitter in such an environment, using a fixed-size buffer.We show that the offline version of the problem can be solved in polynomial time, by introducing an efficient offline algorithm that finds a release schedule with optimal jitter. When regulatingMstreams in the online setting, we take acompetitive analysispoint of view and note that, in the upcapacitated case, previous results in Mansour and Patt-Shamir [2001] can be extended to an online algorithm that uses a buffer of size 2\u22c5M\u22c5Band obtains the optimal jitter possible with a buffer of sizeB(and an offline algorithm). The question arises whether such a resource augmentation is essential. We answer this question in the affirmative, by proving a lower bound that is tight up to a factor of 2, thus showing that jitter regulation does not scale well as the number of streams increases unless the buffer is sized-up proportionally.", "authors": [{"name": "david hay", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100443504"}, {"name": "gabriel scalosub", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384611651"}], "title": "Jitter regulation for multiple streams", "citations": [{"Name": "Madhu Babu Sikha ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "R.

Data aggregation is a possible way to save energy consumption: nodes may delay data in order to aggregate them into a single packet before forwarding them towards some central node (sink). However, many applications impose constraints on the maximum delay of data; this translates into latency constraints for data arriving at the sink.We study the problem of data aggregation to minimize maximum energy consumption under latency constraints on sensed data delivery, and we assume unique communication paths that form an intree rooted at the sink. We prove that the offline problem is strongly NP-hard and we design a 2-approximation algorithm. The latter uses a novel rounding technique.Almost all real-life sensor networks are managed online by simple distributed algorithms in the nodes. In this context we consider both the case in which sensor nodes are synchronized or not. We assess the performance of the algorithm by competitive analysis. We also provide lower bounds for the models we consider, in some cases showing optimality of the algorithms we propose. Most of our results also hold when minimizing the total energy consumption of all nodes.", "authors": [{"name": "luca becchetti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100259139"}, {"name": "alberto marchetti-spaccamela", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100597580"}, {"name": "andrea vitaletti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100283362"}, {"name": "peter korteweg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81333489154"}, {"name": "martin skutella", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100178660"}, {"name": "leen stougie", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100464919"}], "title": "Latency-constrained aggregation in sensor networks", "citations": [{"Name": "Marcin Bienkowski ", "Country": "latvia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jaroslaw Byrka ", "Country": "latvia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marek Chrobak ", "Country": "latvia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Neil Dobbs ", "Country": "latvia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tomasz Nowicki ", "Country": "latvia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Maxim Sviridenko ", "Country": "latvia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Grzegorz \u015awirszcz ", "Country": "latvia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Neal E.

Communication requests arrive over time, and the online algorithm accepts or rejects each request while maintaining the capacity limitations of the network. The admission control problem has been usually analyzed as a benefit problem, where the goal is to devise an online algorithm that accepts the maximum number of requests possible. The problem with this objective function is that even algorithms with optimal competitive ratios may reject almost all of the requests, when it would have been possible to reject only a few. This could be inappropriate for settings in which rejections are intended to be rare events.In this article, we consider preemptive online algorithms whose goal is to minimize the number of rejected requests. Each request arrives together with the path it should be routed on. We show anO(log2(mc))-competitive randomized algorithm for the weighted case, wheremis the number of edges in the graph andcis the maximum edge capacity. For the unweighted case, we give anO(logmlogc)-competitive randomized algorithm. This settles an open question of Blum et al. [2001]. We note that allowing preemption and handling requests with given paths are essential for avoiding trivial lower bounds.The admission control problem is a generalization of the online set cover with repetitions problem, whose input is a family ofmsubsets of a ground set ofnelements. Elements of the ground set are given to the online algorithm one by one, possibly requesting each element a multiple number of times. (If each element arrives at most once, this corresponds to the online set cover problem.) The algorithm must cover each element by different subsets, according to the number of times it has been requested.We give anO(logmlogn)-competitive randomized algorithm for the online set cover with repetitions problem. This matches a recent lower bound of \u03a9(logmlogn) given by Korman [2005] (based on Feige [1998]) for the competitive ratio of any randomizedpolynomialtime algorithm, under theBPP\u2260NPassumption. Given any constant &epsis; > 0, anO(logmlogn)-competitive deterministic bicriteria algorithm is shown that covers each element by at least (1 \u2212 &epsis;)ksets, wherekis the number of times the element is covered by the optimal solution.", "authors": [{"name": "noga alon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100305768"}, {"name": "yossi azar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100215093"}, {"name": "shai gutner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331493679"}], "title": "Admission control to minimize rejections and online set cover with repetitions", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "8\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "223\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "tel-aviv university tel-aviv israel", "city": null, "Name": "noga alon"}, {"country": "Ghana", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research redmond wa and tel-aviv university tel-aviv israel", "city": "wa", "Name": "yossi azar"}, {"country": "israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "tel-aviv university tel-aviv israel", "city": null, "Name": "shai gutner"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Abello, J., Buchsbaum, A., and Westbrook, J. 2002.

Surprisingly, no algorithm with both sublinear space and passes is known for natural graph problems in classical read-only streaming. Motivated by technological factors of modern storage systems, some authors have recently started to investigate the computational power of less restrictive models where writing streams is allowed. In this article, we show that the use of intermediate temporary streams is powerful enough to provide effective space-passes tradeoffs for natural graph problems. In particular, for any space restriction ofsbits, we show that single-source shortest paths in directed graphs with small positive integer edge weights can be solved inO((nlog3/2n)/&sqrt;s) passes. The result can be generalized to deal with multiple sources within the same bounds. This is the first known streaming algorithm for shortest paths in directed graphs. For undirected connectivity, we devise anO((nlogn)/s) passes algorithm. Both problems require \u03a9(n/s) passes under the restrictions we consider. We also show that the model where intermediate temporary streams are allowed can be strictly more powerful than classical streaming for some problems, while maintaining all of its hardness for others.", "authors": [{"name": "camil demetrescu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100357279"}, {"name": "irene finocchi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100246662"}, {"name": "andrea ribichini", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309483171"}], "title": "Trading off space for passes in graph streaming problems", "citations": [{"Name": "Jonathan Berry ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Matthew Oster ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Cynthia A.

A set of cycles is called a cycle basis ofGif it forms a basis for its cycle space. A cycle basis where the sum of the weights of the cycles is minimum is called a minimum cycle basis ofG. Cycle bases of low weight are useful in a number of contexts, for example, the analysis of electrical networks, structural engineering, chemistry, and surface reconstruction.There exists a set of \u0398(mn) cycles which is guaranteed to contain a minimum cycle basis. A minimum basis can be extracted by Gaussian elimination. The resulting algorithm [Horton 1987] was the first polynomial-time algorithm. Faster and more complicated algorithms have been found since then.We present a very simple method for extracting a minimum cycle basis from the candidate set with running timeO(m2n), which improves the running time for sparse graphs. Furthermore, in the undirected case by using bit-packing we improve the running time also in the case of dense graphs. For undirected graphs we derive anO(m2n/logn+n2m) algorithm. For directed graphs we get anO(m3n) deterministic and anO(m2n) randomized algorithm.Our results improve the running times of both exact and approximate algorithms.

Two of the best known are the Knuth-Yao quadrangle inequality speedup and the SMAWK algorithm for finding the row-minima of totally monotone matrices. Although both of these techniques use a quadrangle inequality and seem similar, they are actually quite different and have been used differently in the literature.In this article we show that the Knuth-Yao technique is actually a direct consequence of total monotonicity. As well as providing new derivations of the Knuth-Yao result, this also permits to solve the Knuth-Yao problem directly using the SMAWK algorithm. Another consequence of this approach is a method for solvingonlineversions of problems with the Knuth-Yao property. The online algorithms given here are asymptotically as fast as the best previously known static ones. For example, the Knuth-Yao technique speeds up the standard dynamic program for finding the optimal binary search tree ofnelements from \u0398(n3) down toO(n2), and the results in this article allow construction of an optimal binary search tree in an online fashion (adding a node to the left or the right of the current nodes at each step) inO(n) time per step.", "authors": [{"name": "wolfgang bein", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100549945"}, {"name": "mordecai j golin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100161731"}, {"name": "lawrence l larmore", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100074657"}, {"name": "yan zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81387603152"}], "title": "The Knuth-Yao quadrangle-inequality speedup is a consequence of total monotonicity", "citations": [{"Name": "Charalampos E.

The traditional approach of deidentifying records is to remove identifying fields such as social security number, name, etc. However, recent research has shown that a large fraction of the U.S. population can be identified using nonkey attributes (called quasi-identifiers) such as date of birth, gender, and zip code. Thek-anonymity model protects privacy via requiring that nonkey attributes that leak information are suppressed or generalized so that, for every record in the modified table, there are at leastk\u22121 other records having exactly the same values for quasi-identifiers. We propose a new method for anonymizing data records, where quasi-identifiers of data records are first clustered and then cluster centers are published. To ensure privacy of the data records, we impose the constraint that each cluster must contain no fewer than a prespecified number of data records. This technique is more general since we have a much larger choice for cluster centers thank-anonymity. In many cases, it lets us release a lot more information without compromising privacy. We also provide constant factor approximation algorithms to come up with such a clustering. This is the first set of algorithms for the anonymization problem where the performance is independent of the anonymity parameterk. We further observe that a few outlier points can significantly increase the cost of anonymization. Hence, we extend our algorithms to allow an &epsi; fraction of points to remain unclustered, that is, deleted from the anonymized publication. Thus, by not releasing a small fraction of the database records, we can ensure that the data published for analysis has less distortion and hence is more useful. Our approximation algorithms for new clustering objectives are of independent interest and could be applicable in other clustering scenarios as well.", "authors": [{"name": "gagan aggarwal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100021311"}, {"name": "rina panigrahy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81326491682"}, {"name": "tomas feder", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100248357"}, {"name": "dilys thomas", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100412109"}, {"name": "krishnaram kenthapadi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81342500095"}, {"name": "samir khuller", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331496155"}, {"name": "an zhu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100413799"}], "title": "Achieving anonymity via clustering", "citations": [{"Name": "Krzysztof Choromanski ", "Country": "oman", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tal Malkin", "Country": "oman", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Paola Bonizzoni ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gianluca Della Vedova ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Riccardo Dondi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yuri Pirola", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sariel Har-Peled ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Benjamin Adam Raichel", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sariel Har-Peled ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Benjamin Raichel", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "54\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "491\n", "Citation Count": "10\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "google inc mountian view ca", "city": null, "Name": "gagan aggarwal"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research mountian view ca", "city": null, "Name": "rina panigrahy"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "stanford university stanford ca", "city": null, "Name": "tomas feder"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "oracle redwood shores ca", "city": null, "Name": "dilys thomas"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research mountain view ca", "city": null, "Name": "krishnaram kenthapadi"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland college park md", "city": null, "Name": "samir khuller"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "google inc mountian view ca", "city": null, "Name": "an zhu"}]}, "Article No.: 51": {"references": ["Noga Alon , Yossi Matias , Mario Szegedy, The space complexity of approximating the frequency moments, Journal of Computer and System Sciences, v.58 n.1, p.137-147, Feb. 1999[doi>10.1006/jcss.1997.1545]\n", "Arvind Arasu , Gurmeet Singh Manku, Approximate counts and quantiles over sliding windows, Proceedings of the twenty-third ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems, June 14-16, 2004, Paris, France[doi>10.1145/1055558.1055598]\n", "Brian Babcock , Mayur Datar , Rajeev Motwani, Sampling from a moving window over streaming data, Proceedings of the thirteenth annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithms, p.633-634, January 06-08, 2002, San Francisco, California\n", "Ziv Bar-Yossef , T.

Namely, we are interested in randomized sublinear algorithms that approximate the Hamming distance between a given function and the closest monotone function. We allow both an additive error, parameterized by \u03b4, and a multiplicative error.Previous work on distance approximation to monotonicity focused on the one-dimensional case and the only explicit extension to higher dimensions was with a multiplicative approximation factor exponential in the dimensiond. Building on Goldreich et al. [2000] and Dodis et al. [1999], in which there are better implicit results for the casen&equals;2, we describe a reduction from the case of functions over thed-dimensional hypercube [n]dto the case of functions over thek-dimensional hypercube [n]k, where 1\u2264k\u2264d. The quality of estimation that this reduction provides is linear in \u2308d/k\u2309 and logarithmic in the size of the range &vert;R&vert; (if the range is infinite or just very large, then log &vert;R&vert; can be replaced bydlogn). Using this reduction and a known distance approximation algorithm for the one-dimensional case, we obtain a distance approximation algorithm for functions over thed-dimensional hypercube, with any rangeR, which has a multiplicative approximation factor ofO(dlog &vert;R&vert;).For the case of a binary range, we present algorithms for distance approximation to monotonicity of functions over one dimension, two dimensions, and thek-dimensional hypercube (for anyk\u2265 1). Applying these algorithms and the reduction described before, we obtain a variety of distance approximation algorithms for Boolean functions over thed-dimensional hypercube which suggest a trade-off between quality of estimation and efficiency of computation. In particular, the multiplicative error ranges betweenO(d) andO(1).", "authors": [{"name": "shahar fattal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81464673728"}, {"name": "dana ron", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100218595"}], "title": "Approximating the distance to monotonicity in high dimensions", "citations": [{"Name": "Michael Saks ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "C.

Motivated by this, we are interested in the problem of maximizing the throughput of protocols that control packet networks. Moreover, we are interested in a setting where different packets have different priorities (or weights), thus taking into account Quality-of-Service considerations.We first extend the Competitive Network Throughput (CNT) model introduced by Aiello et al. [2003] to the weighted packets case. We analyze the performance of online, local-control protocols by their competitive ratio, in the face of arbitrary traffic, using as a measure the total weight of the packets that arrive to their destinations, rather than being dropped en-route. We prove that on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), any greedy protocol is competitive, with competitive ratio independent of the weights of the packets. Here we mean by a \u201cgreedy protocol\u201d a protocol that not only does not leave a resource idle unnecessarily, but also prefers packets with higher weight over those with lower weight. We give two independent upper bounds on the competitive ratio of general greedy protocols on DAGs. We further give lower bounds that show that our upper bounds cannot be improved (other than constant factors) in the general case. Both our upper and lower bounds apply also to the unweighted case, and they improve the results given in Aiello et al. [2003] for that case. We thus give tight (up to constant factors) upper and lower bounds for both the unweighted and weighted cases.In the course of proving our upper bounds we prove a lemma that gives upper bounds on the delivery times of packets by any greedy protocol on general DAGs (without buffer size considerations).

In order to achieve this, we introduce a new problem which we call thedirected penalized linear arrangement. This problem generalizes both the directed feedback edge set problem and the directed linear arrangement problem. We present anO(lognlog logn)-approximation factor algorithm for this newly defined problem. Our solution uses two distinct directed metrics (\u201cright\u201d and \u201cleft\u201d) which together yield a lower bound on the value of an optimal solution. In addition, we define a sequence of new directed spreading metrics that are used for applying the algorithm recursively on smaller subgraphs. The new spreading metrics allow us to define an asymmetric region growing procedure that accounts simultaneously for both incoming and outgoing edges. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a region growing procedure is defined in directed graphs that allows for such an accounting.", "authors": [{"name": "joseph seffi naor", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351600927"}, {"name": "roy schwartz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100403392"}], "title": "The directed circular arrangement problem", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "9\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "248\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "technion haifa israel", "city": "haifa", "Name": "joseph seffi naor"}, {"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "technion haifa israel", "city": "haifa", "Name": "roy schwartz"}]}, "Article No.: 54": {"references": ["Alon, N., Bruck, J., Naor, J., Naor, M., and Roth, R.

In this article, this concept is generalized with the following definition. We say that a family of functions from [n] to [k] is a \u03b4-balanced (n,k)-family of perfect hash functions if for everyS\u2286 [n], &vert;S&vert;&equals;k, the number of functions that are 1-1 onSis betweenT/\u03b4 and \u03b4Tfor some constantT>0. The standard definition of a family of perfect hash functions requires that there will be at least one function that is 1-1 onS, for eachSof sizek. In the new notion of balanced families, we require the number of 1-1 functions to be almost the same (taking \u03b4 to be close to 1) for every suchS. Our main result is that for any constant \u03b4 > 1, a \u03b4-balanced (n,k)-family of perfect hash functions of size 2O(klog logk)logncan be constructed in time 2O(klog logk)nlogn. Using the technique of color-coding we can apply our explicit constructions to devise approximation algorithms for various counting problems in graphs. In particular, we exhibit a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for approximating both the number of simple paths of lengthkand the number of simple cycles of sizekfor anyk\u2264O(logn/log log logn) in a graph withnvertices. The approximation is up to any fixed desirable relative error.", "authors": [{"name": "noga alon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100305768"}, {"name": "shai gutner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331493679"}], "title": "Balanced families of perfect hash functions and their applications", "citations": [{"Name": "Fedor V.

Error confinement means that to the external observer, only nodes that were directly hit by a fault may deviate from their specified correct behavior, and only temporarily. The externally observable behavior of all other nodes must remain impeccable, even though their internal state may be affected. Error confinement is impossible if an adversary is allowed to inflict arbitrary transient faults on the system, since the faults might completely wipe out input values. We introduce a new fault-tolerance measure we callagility, which quantifies the fault tolerance of an algorithm that disseminates information against state corrupting faults.We then propose broadcast algorithms that guarantee error confinement with optimal agility to within a constant factor in synchronous networks. These algorithms can serve as building blocks in more general reactive systems. Previous results in exploring locality in reactive systems were not error confined, or allowed a wide range of behaviors to be considered correct.

Then, we consider the average total cost of these strategies, which takes into account the cost of both comparisons and exchanges.

Formally, given a metric space onnverticesV, withmdemand pairs \u2286V\u00d7Vand a \u201ctarget\u201dk\u2264m, the goal is to find a minimum cost subgraph that connectsat leastkpairs. In this paper, we give anO(min{&sqrt;n\u22c5logk,&sqrt;k})-approximation algorithm fork-forest, improving on the previous best ratio ofO(min {n2/3,&sqrt;m}logn) by Segev and Segev.We then apply our algsorithm fork-forest to obtain approximation algorithms for severalDial-a-Rideproblems. The basic Dial-a-Ride problem is the following: given annpoint metric space withmobjects each with its own source and destination, and a vehicle capable of carryingat mostkobjects at any time, find the minimum length tour that uses this vehicle to move each object from its source to destination. We want that the tour benon-preemptive: that is, each object, once picked up at its source, is dropped only at its destination. We prove that an \u03b1-approximation algorithm for thek-forest problem implies anO(\u03b1\u22c5log2n)-approximation algorithm for Dial-a-Ride. Using our results fork-forest, we get anO(min{&sqrt;n,&sqrt;k}\u22c5log2n)-approximation algorithm for Dial-a-Ride. The only previous result known for Dial-a-Ride was anO(&sqrt;klogn)-approximation by Charikar and Raghavachari; our results give a different proof of a similar approximation guarantee\u2014in fact, when the vehicle capacitykis large, we give a slight improvement on their results. The reduction from Dial-a-Ride to thek-forest problem is fairly robust, and allows us to obtain approximation algorithms (with the same guarantee) for some interesting generalizations of Dial-a-Ride.", "authors": [{"name": "anupam gupta", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331493786"}, {"name": "mohammadtaghi hajiaghayi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100596923"}, {"name": "viswanath nagarajan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100035191"}, {"name": "r ravi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332522703"}], "title": "Dial a Ride fromk-forest", "citations": [{"Name": "Inge Li G\u00f8rtz ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Viswanath Nagarajan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "R.

Its algorithmic importance comes from the fact that, as shown in previous work, Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) and various problems in database theory are polynomial-time solvable if the input contains a bounded-width fractional hypertree decomposition of the hypergraph of the constraints. In this article, we show that for every fixedw\u2265 1, there is a polynomial-time algorithm that, given a hypergraphHwith fractional hypertree width at mostw, computes a fractional hypertree decomposition of widthO(w3) forH. This means that polynomial-time algorithms relying on bounded-width fractional hypertree decompositions no longer need to be given a decomposition explicitly in the input, since an appropriate decomposition can be computed in polynomial time. Therefore, ifHis a class of hypergraphs with bounded fractional hypertree width, then a CSP restricted to instances whose structure is inHis polynomial-time solvable.

The first nontrivial algorithm, with running timeO(mn), dates back to K\u00f6nig's work in 1916 (herem&equals;ndis the number of edges in the graph, 2nis the number of vertices, anddis the degree of each node). The currently most efficient algorithm takes timeO(m), and is due to Cole et al. &lsqb;2001&rsqb;. We improve this running time toO(min{m,n2.5lnn/d}); this minimum can never be larger thanO(n1.75&sqrt;lnn). We obtain this improvement by proving a uniform sampling theorem: if we sample each edge in ad-regular bipartite graph independently with a probabilityp&equals;O(nlnn/d2) then the resulting graph has a perfect matching with high probability. The proof involves a decomposition of the graph into pieces which are guaranteed to have many perfect matchings but do not have any small cuts. We then establish a correspondence between potential witnesses to nonexistence of a matching (after sampling) in any piece and cuts of comparable size in that same piece. Karger's sampling theorem &lsqb;1994a, 1994b&rsqb; for preserving cuts in a graph can now be adapted to prove our uniform sampling theorem for preserving perfect matchings. Using theO(m&sqrt;n) algorithm (due to Hopcroft and Karp &lsqb;1973&rsqb;) for finding maximum matchings in bipartite graphs on the sampled graph then yields the stated running time.

For Minimum Vertex Cover, we give a (2\u22121/t)-approximation algorithm which also works when at-interval representation of our given graph is absent. Following this, we give at2-approximation algorithm for Minimum Dominating Set which adapts well to more general variants of the problem.

Assume there is a collection of bidders, each of whom is interested in buying a copy of an item of which there is an unlimited supply. Every bidder is associated with a time interval over which the bidder will consider buying a copy of the item, and a maximum value the bidder is willing to pay for the item. On every time unit, the seller sets a price for the item. The seller's goal is to set the prices so as to maximize revenue from the sale of copies of items over the time period.In the first model considered, we assume that all bidders areimpatient, that is, bidders buy the item at the first time unit within their bid interval that they can afford the price. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that considers this model. In the offline setting, we assume that the seller knows the bids of all the bidders in advance. In the online setting we assume that at each time unit the seller only knows the values of the bids that have arrived before or at that time unit. We give a polynomial time offline algorithm and prove upper and lower bounds on the competitiveness of deterministic and randomized online algorithms, compared with the optimal offline solution. The gap between the upper and lower bounds is quadratic.We also consider theenvy-freemodel in which bidders are sold the item at the minimum price during their bid interval, as long as it is not over their limit value. We prove tight bounds on the competitiveness of deterministic online algorithms for this model, and upper and lower bounds on the competitiveness of randomized algorithms with quadratic gap.

An instance of it consists of an edge capacitated graph and a set of connection requests, each of which is associated with source and target vertices, a demand, and a value. The objective is to route a maximum value subset of requests subject to the edge capacities. It is a well known fact that as the capacities of the edges are larger with respect to the maximal demand among the requests, the problem can be approximated better. In particular, it is known that for sufficiently large capacities, the integrality gap of the corresponding integer linear program becomes 1 + &epsis;, which can be matched by an algorithm that utilizes the randomized rounding technique.In this article, we focus our attention on the large capacities unsplittable flow problem in a game theoretic setting. In this setting, there are selfish agents, which control some of the requests characteristics, and may be dishonest about them. It is worth noting that in game theoretic settings many standard techniques, such as randomized rounding, violate certain monotonicity properties, which are imperative for truthfulness, and therefore cannot be employed. In light of this state of affairs, we design a monotone deterministic algorithm, which is based on a primal-dual machinery, which attains an approximation ratio ofe/e\u22121, up to a disparity of &epsis; away. This implies an improvement on the current best truthful mechanism, as well as an improvement on the current best combinatorial algorithm for the problem under consideration. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that any algorithm in the family of reasonable iterative path minimizing algorithms, cannot yield a better approximation ratio. Consequently, it follows that in order to achieve a monotone PTAS, if that exists, one would have to exert different techniques. We also consider the large capacitiessingle-minded multi-unit combinatorial auction problem. This problem is closely related to the unsplittable flow problem since one can formulate it as a special case of the integer linear program of the unsplittable flow problem. Accordingly, we obtain a comparable performance guarantee by refining the algorithm suggested for the unsplittable flow problem.", "authors": [{"name": "yossi azar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100215093"}, {"name": "iftah gamzu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384605606"}, {"name": "shai gutner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331493679"}], "title": "Truthful unsplittable flow for large capacity networks", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "11\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "198\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Ghana", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research redmond wa and tel-aviv university tel-aviv israel", "city": "wa", "Name": "yossi azar"}, {"country": "israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "tel-aviv university tel-aviv israel", "city": null, "Name": "iftah gamzu"}, {"country": "israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "tel-aviv university tel-aviv israel", "city": null, "Name": "shai gutner"}]}, "Article No.: 25": {"references": ["Karl Abrahamson, On achieving consensus using a shared memory, Proceedings of the seventh annual ACM Symposium on Principles of distributed computing, p.291-302, August 15-17, 1988, Toronto, Ontario, Canada[doi>10.1145/62546.62594]\n", "Alon, N., and Spencer, J.

To this end; we present algorithms for discovering periodic trends in the combinatorial property testing model in a data streamSof lengthnusingo(n) samples and space.In accordance with the property testing model, we first explore the notion of being \u201cclose\u201d to periodic by defining three different notions of self-distance through relaxing different notions of exact periodicity. An inputSis then called approximately periodic if it exhibits a small self-distance (with respect to any one self-distance defined). We show that even though the different definitions of exact periodicity are equivalent, the resulting definitions of self-distance and approximate periodicity are not; we also show that these self-distances are constant approximations of each other. Afterwards, we present algorithms which distinguish between the two cases whereSis exactly periodic andSis far from periodic with only a constant probability of error.Our algorithms sample onlyO(&sqrt;nlog2n) (orO(&sqrt;nlog4n), depending on the self-distance) positions and use as much space. They can also find, usingo(n) samples and space, the largest/smallest period, and/or all of the approximate periods ofS. These algorithms can also be viewed as working on streaming inputs where each data item is seen once and in order, storing only a sublinear (O(&sqrt;nlog2n) orO(&sqrt;nlog4n)) size sample from which periodicities are identified.", "authors": [{"name": "funda ergun", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100363852"}, {"name": "s muthukrishnan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350571838"}, {"name": "cenk sahinalp", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309511532"}], "title": "Periodicity testing with sublinear samples and space", "citations": [{"Name": "Michael S.

Fractional scheduling is the LP-relaxation of the problem, which is polynomially solvable in the nonstrategic setting, and is a useful tool to design deterministic and randomized approximation algorithms.The mechanism design version of the scheduling problem was introduced by Nisan and Ronen. In this article, we consider the mechanism design version of the fractional variant of this problem. We give lower bounds for any fractional truthful mechanism. Our lower bounds also hold for any (randomized) mechanism for the integral case. In the positive direction, we propose a truthful mechanism that achieves approximation 3/2 for 2 machines, matching the lower bound. This is the first new tight bound on the approximation ratio of this problem, after the tight bound of 2, for 2 machines, obtained by Nisan and Ronen. Fornmachines, our mechanism achieves an approximation ratio ofn+1/2.Motivated by the fact that all the known deterministic and randomized mechanisms for the problem assign each task independently from the others, we focus on an interesting subclass of allocation algorithms, thetask-independentalgorithms. We give a lower bound ofn+1/2, that holds for every (not only monotone) allocation algorithm that takes independent decisions. Under this consideration, our truthful independent mechanism is the best that we can hope from this family of algorithms.", "authors": [{"name": "george christodoulou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100394626"}, {"name": "elias koutsoupias", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100645790"}, {"name": "annamaria kovacs", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413595686"}], "title": "Mechanism design for fractional scheduling on unrelated machines", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "16\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "283\n", "Citation Count": "6\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "max-planck-institut fur informatik saarbrucken germany", "city": "saarbrucken", "Name": "george christodoulou"}, {"country": "greece", "university": "university of athens", "affiliation_string": "university of athens athens greece", "city": "athens", "Name": "elias koutsoupias"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "max-planck-institut fur informatik saarbrucken germany", "city": "saarbrucken", "Name": "annamaria kovacs"}]}, "Article No.: 24": {"references": ["Sergio Cabello, Many distances in planar graphs, Proceedings of the seventeenth annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithm, p.1213-1220, January 22-26, 2006, Miami, Florida[doi>10.1145/1109557.1109691]\n", "Sergio Cabello , Erin W.

Convex coloring has applications in fields such as phylogenetics, communication or transportation networks, etc.When a coloring of a graph is not convex, a natural question is how far it is from a convex one. This problem is denoted asconvex recoloring(CR). While the initial works on CR defined and studied the problem on trees, recent efforts aim at either generalizing the underlying graphs or specializing the input colorings.In this work, we extend the underlying graph and the input coloring to partially colored galled networks. We show that although determining whether a coloring is convex on an arbitrary network is hard, it can be found efficiently on galled networks. We present a fixed parameter tractable algorithm that finds the recoloring distance of such a network whose running time is quadratic in the network size and exponential in that distance.

The standard Robertson-Webb model allows the protocol to make two types of queries, Evaluation and Cut, to the players. A deterministic divide-and-conquer protocol with complexityO(nlogn) is known. We provide the first a \u03a9(nlogn) lower bound on the complexity of any deterministic protocol in the standard model. This improves previous lower bounds, in that the protocol is allowed to assign to a player a piece that is a union of intervals and only guarantee approximate fairness. We accomplish this by lower bounding the complexity to find, for a single player, a piece of cake that is both rich in value, and thin in width. We then introduce a version of cake cutting in which the players are able to cut with only finite precision. In this case, we can extend the \u03a9(nlogn) lower bound to include randomized protocols.", "authors": [{"name": "jeff edmonds", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100162979"}, {"name": "kirk pruhs", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100267337"}], "title": "Cake cutting really is not a piece of cake", "citations": [{"Name": "Erel Segal-Halevi ", "Country": "turkey", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Avinatan Hassidim ", "Country": "turkey", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yonatan Aumann", "Country": "turkey", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "20\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "287\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "canada", "university": "york university", "affiliation_string": "york university canada", "city": "toronto", "Name": "jeff edmonds"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of pittsburgh pittsburgh pa", "city": "pittsburgh", "Name": "kirk pruhs"}]}, "Article No.: 46": {"references": ["Mohan Ahuja , Yahui Zhu, An Efficient Distributed Algorithm for Finding Articulation Points, Bridges, and Biconnected Components in Asynchronous Networks, Proceedings of the Ninth Conference on Foundations of Software Technology and Theoretical Computer Science, p.99-108, December 19-21, 1989\n", "Stephen Alstrup , Cyril Gavoille , Haim Kaplan , Theis Rauhe, Nearest common ancestors: a survey and a new distributed algorithm, Proceedings of the fourteenth annual ACM symposium on Parallel algorithms and architectures, August 10-13, 2002, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada[doi>10.1145/564870.564914]\n", "B.

For a graph (V,E), its cycle space is the family of all subsets ofEthat have even degree at each vertex. We prove that with high probability, sampling the cycle space identifies the cuts of a graph. This leads to simple new linear-time sequential algorithms for finding all cut edges and cut pairs (a set of 2 edges that form a cut) of a graph.In the model of distributed computing in a graphG&equals; (V,E) withO(log &vert;V&vert;)-bit messages, our approach yields faster algorithms for several problems. The diameter ofGis denoted byD, and the maximum degree by \u0394. We obtain simpleO(D)-time distributed algorithms to find all cut edges, 2-edge-connected components, and cut pairs, matching or improving upon previous time bounds. Under natural conditions these new algorithms are universally optimal\u2014that is, a \u03a9(D)-time lower bound holds on every graph. We obtain aO(D+\u0394/log &vert;V&vert;)-time distributed algorithm for finding cut vertices; this is faster than the best previous algorithm when \u0394,D&equals;O(&sqrt;&vert;V&vert;). A simple extension of our work yields the first distributed algorithm with sub-linear time for 3-edge-connected components. The basic distributed algorithms are Monte Carlo, but they can be made Las Vegas without increasing the asymptotic complexity.In the model of parallel computing on the EREW PRAM, our approach yields a simple algorithm with optimal time complexityO(logV) for finding cut pairs and 3-edge-connected components.", "authors": [{"name": "david pritchard", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100059507"}, {"name": "ramakrishna thurimella", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100030434"}], "title": "Fast computation of small cuts via cycle space sampling", "citations": [{"Name": "Daniel Delling ", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andrew V.

Classical representations of suffix trees require \u0398(nlogn) bits of space, for a string of sizen. This is considerably more than thenlog2\u03c3 bits needed for the string itself, where \u03c3 is the alphabet size. The size of suffix trees has been a barrier to their wider adoption in practice. Recent compressed suffix tree representations require just the space of the compressed string plus \u0398(n) extra bits. This is already spectacular, but the linear extra bits are still unsatisfactory when \u03c3 is small as in DNA sequences. In this article, we introduce the first compressed suffix tree representation that breaks this \u0398(n)-bit space barrier. The Fully Compressed Suffix Tree (FCST) representation requires only sublinear space on top of the compressed text size, and supports a wide set of navigational operations in almost logarithmic time. This includes extracting arbitrary text substrings, so the FCST replaces the text using almost the same space as the compressed text. An essential ingredient of FCSTs is the lowest common ancestor (LCA) operation. We reveal important connections between LCAs and suffix tree navigation. We also describe how to make FCSTs dynamic, that is, support updates to the text. The dynamic FCST also supports several operations. In particular, it can build the static FCST within optimal space and polylogarithmic time per symbol. Our theoretical results are also validated experimentally, showing that FCSTs are very effective in practice as well.", "authors": [{"name": "luis m s russo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330497734"}, {"name": "gonzalo navarro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100113887"}, {"name": "arlindo l oliveira", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100516676"}], "title": "Fully compressed suffix trees", "citations": [{"Name": "Yu-Feng Chien ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wing-Kai Hon ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rahul Shah ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sharma V.

There arenpages of information, and clients request pages at different times. However, multiple clients can have their requests satisfied by a single broadcast of the requested page. In this article, we consider several related broadcast scheduling problems. One central problem we study simply asks to minimize the maximum response time (over all requests). Another related problem we consider is the version in which every request has a release time and a deadline, and the goal is to maximize the number of requests that meet their deadlines. While approximation algorithms for both these problems were proposed several years back, it was not known if they were NP-complete. One of our main results is that both these problems are NP-complete. In addition, we use the same unified approach to give a simple NP-completeness proof for minimizing the sum of response times. A very complicated proof was known for this version. Furthermore, we give a proof that FIFO is a 2-competitive online algorithm for minimizing the maximum response time (this result had been claimed earlier with no proof) and that there is no better deterministic online algorithm (this result was claimed earlier as well, but with an incorrect proof).", "authors": [{"name": "jessica chang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81421599089"}, {"name": "thomas erlebach", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100137438"}, {"name": "renars gailis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81421594659"}, {"name": "samir khuller", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331496155"}], "title": "Broadcast scheduling: Algorithms and complexity", "citations": [{"Name": "Jessica Chang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Harold N.

In a long series of papers, the lower bound of this ratio has been improved from 1.808, 1.856 to 1.907 and its upper bound reduced from 3.25, 3.0625, 2.8596, 2.7834 to 2.66013. In this article, we rewrite the upper bound record to 2.5545. Our idea for the improvement is as follows.In 2002, Seiden and van Stee [Seiden and van Stee 2003] proposed an elegant algorithm calledH\u2297C, comprised of theHarmonic algorithmHand theImproved Harmonic algorithmC, for the two-dimensional online bin packing problem and proved that the algorithm has an asymptotic competitive ratio of at most 2.66013. Since the best known online algorithm for one-dimensional bin packing is theSuper Harmonic algorithm[Seiden 2002], a natural question to ask is: could a better upper bound be achieved by using the Super Harmonic algorithm instead of the Improved Harmonic algorithm? However, as mentioned in Seiden and van Stee [2003], the previous analysis framework does not work. In this article, we give a positive answer for this question. A new upper bound of 2.5545 is obtained for 2-dimensional online bin packing. The main idea is to develop new weighting functions for the Super Harmonic algorithm and propose new techniques to bound the total weight in a rectangular bin.", "authors": [{"name": "xin han", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81336489543"}, {"name": "francis y l chin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81487646604"}, {"name": "hing-fung ting", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452595971"}, {"name": "guochuan zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451595913"}, {"name": "yong zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81324495453"}], "title": "A new upper bound 2.5545 on 2D Online Bin Packing", "citations": [{"Name": "Rob van Stee", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yong Zhang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Francis Y.

The concept is to design auxiliary data structures that ideally occupy asymptotically less space than the information-theoretic lower bound on the space required to encode the given data, and support an extended set of operations using the basic operators defined in the ADT. The main advantage of succinct indexes as opposed to succinct (integrated data/index) encodings is that we make assumptions only on the ADT through which the main data is accessed, rather than the way in which the data is encoded. This allows more freedom in the encoding of the main data. In this article, we present succinct indexes for various data types, namely strings, binary relations and multilabeled trees. Given the support for the interface of the ADTs of these data types, we can support various useful operations efficiently by constructing succinct indexes for them. When the operators in the ADTs are supported in constant time, our results are comparable to previous results, while allowing more flexibility in the encoding of the given data.Using our techniques, we design a succinct encoding that represents a string of lengthnover an alphabet of size \u03c3 usingnHk(S) + lg \u03c3 \u00b7o(n) +O(nlg \u03c3/lg lg lg \u03c3) bits to support access/rank/select operations ino((lg lg \u03c3)1+&epsi;) time, for any fixed constant &epsi; > 0. We also design a succinct text index usingnH0(S) +O(nlg \u03c3/lg lg \u03c3) bits that supports finding all the occ occurrences of a given pattern of lengthminO(mlg lg \u03c3 + occ lgn/lg&epsi;\u03c3) time, for any fixed constant 0 < &epsi; < 1. Previous results on these two problems either have a lg \u03c3 factor instead of lg lg \u03c3 in the running time, or are not compressed. Finally, we present succinct encodings of binary relations and multi-labeled trees that are more compact than previous structures.", "authors": [{"name": "jeremy barbay", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81336487808"}, {"name": "meng he", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100331150"}, {"name": "j ian munro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453619109"}, {"name": "srinivasa rao satti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436596025"}], "title": "Succinct indexes for strings, binary relations and multilabeled trees", "citations": [{"Name": "Meng He ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "J.

An out-branching is a spanning out-tree. By &ell;(D) and &ell;s(D), we denote the maximum number of leaves over all out-trees and out-branchings ofD, respectively.We give fixed parameter tractable algorithms for deciding whether &ell;s(D) \u2265kand whether &ell;(D) \u2265kfor a digraphDonnvertices, both with time complexity 2O(klogk)\u00b7nO(1). This answers an open question whether the problem for out-branchings is in FPT, and improves on the previous complexity of 2O(klog2k)\u00b7nO(1)in the case of out-trees.To obtain the complexity bound in the case of out-branchings, we prove that when all arcs ofDare part of at least one out-branching, &ell;s(D) \u2265 &ell;(D)/3. The second bound we prove in this article states that for strongly connected digraphsDwith minimum in-degree 3, &ell;s(D) \u2265 \u0398(&sqrt;n), where previously &ell;s(D) \u2265 \u0398(3&sqrt;n) was the best known bound.

In this article we propose theCompressedPermuterm Index which solves the Tolerant Retrieval problem in time proportional to the length of the searched pattern, and space close to thekth order empirical entropy of the indexed dictionary. We also design adynamicversion of this index that allows to efficiently manage insertion in, and deletion from, the dictionary of individual strings.The result is based on a simple variant of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform, defined on a dictionary of strings of variable length, that allows to efficiently solve the Tolerant Retrieval problem via known (dynamic) compressed indexes &lsqb;Navarro and M\u00e4kinen 2007&rsqb;. We will complement our theoretical study with a significant set of experiments that show that the Compressed Permuterm Index supports fast queries within a space occupancy that is close to the one achievable by compressing the string dictionary via gzip or bzip.

It is known that for any instance, there exists a solution, and there is a polynomial time algorithm to find one. However, the matching obtained by this algorithm is man-optimal, that is, the matching is favorable for men but unfavorable for women, (or, if we exchange the roles of men and women, the resulting matching is woman-optimal). The sex-equal stable marriage problem, posed by Gusfield and Irving, seeks a stable matching \u201cfair\u201d for both genders. Specifically it seeks a stable matching with the property that the sum of the men's scores is as close as possible to that of the women's. This problem is known to be strongly NP-hard.In this paper, we give a polynomial time algorithm for findinga near optimalsolution for the sex-equal stable marriage problem. Furthermore, we consider the problem of optimizing an additional criterion: among stable matchings that are near optimal in terms of the sex-equality, find a minimum egalitarian stable matching. We show that this problem is strongly NP-hard, and give a polynomial time algorithm whose approximation ratio is less than two.", "authors": [{"name": "kazuo iwama", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100225415"}, {"name": "shuichi miyazaki", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100538458"}, {"name": "hiroki yanagisawa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100312562"}], "title": "Approximation algorithms for the sex-equal stable marriage problem", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "36\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "475\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "japan", "university": "kyoto university", "affiliation_string": "kyoto university kyoto japan", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "kazuo iwama"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "kyoto university", "affiliation_string": "kyoto university kyoto japan", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "shuichi miyazaki"}, {"country": "japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm research-tokyo kanagawa-ken japan", "city": null, "Name": "hiroki yanagisawa"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Ittai Abraham , Yair Bartal , T-H.

It is well known that any graph contains a (multiplicative) (2k\u22121, 0)-spanner of sizeO(n1+1/k) and an (additive) (1,2)-spanner of sizeO(n3/2). However no other additive spanners are known to exist.In this article we develop a couple of new techniques for constructing (\u03b1, \u03b2)-spanners. Our first result is an additive (1,6)-spanner of sizeO(n4/3). The construction algorithm can be understood as an economical agent that assignscostsandvaluesto paths in the graph,purchasingaffordable paths and ignoring expensive ones, which are intuitively well approximated by paths already purchased. We show that thispath buyingalgorithm can be parameterized in different ways to yield other sparseness-distortion tradeoffs. Our second result addresses the problem of which (\u03b1, \u03b2)-spanners can be computed efficiently, ideally in linear time. We show that, for anyk, a (k,k\u22121)-spanner with sizeO(kn1+1/k) can be found in linear time, and, further, that in a distributed network the algorithm terminates in a constant number of rounds. Previous spanner constructions with similar performance had roughly twice the multiplicative distortion.", "authors": [{"name": "surender baswana", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100040620"}, {"name": "telikepalli kavitha", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100468655"}, {"name": "kurt mehlhorn", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100071935"}, {"name": "seth pettie", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339521982"}], "title": "Additive spanners and (\u03b1, \u03b2)-spanners", "citations": [{"Name": "David P.

The performance of the system optimization and monitoring schemes can be improved by spending resources such as time or bandwidth inobservingorresolvingthe values of these parameters. In a resource-constrained situation, deciding which parameters to observe in order to best optimize the expected system performance (or in general, optimize the expected value of a certain objective function) itself becomes an interesting optimization problem.In this article, we initiate the study of such problems that we term \u201cmodel-driven optimization\u201d.

Each player has a set of possible strategies and each resource has a function associating the latency it incurs to the players using it. Players are non--cooperative and each wishes to follow a strategy that minimizes her own latency with no regard to the global optimum. Previous work has studied the impact of this selfish behavior on system performance. In this article, we study the question of how much the performance can be improved if players are forced to pay taxes for using resources. Our objective is to extend the original game so that selfish behavior does not deteriorate performance. We consider atomic congestion games with linear latency functions and present both negative and positive results. Our negative results show that optimal system performance cannot be achieved even in very simple games. On the positive side, we show that there are ways to assign taxes that can improve the performance of linear congestion games by forcing players to follow strategies where the total latency suffered is within a factor of 2 of the minimum possible; this result is shown to be tight. Furthermore, even in cases where in the absence of taxes the system behavior may be very poor, we show that the total disutility of players (latency plus taxes) is not much larger than the optimal total latency. Besides existential results, we show how to compute taxes in time polynomial in the size of the game by solving convex quadratic programs. Similar questions have been extensively studied in the model of non-atomic congestion games. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of the efficiency of taxes in atomic congestion games.", "authors": [{"name": "ioannis caragiannis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100566963"}, {"name": "christos kaklamanis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100644646"}, {"name": "panagiotis kanellopoulos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100506376"}], "title": "Taxes for linear atomic congestion games", "citations": [{"Name": "Richard Cole ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jos\u00e9 R.

This bound is asymptotically optimal in the worst case. If there are union operations that join a set with itself, our algorithm usesO(SORT(N) + MST(N)) I/Os, where MST(N) is the number of I/Os needed to compute the minimum spanning tree of a graph withNedges. We also describe a simple and practicalO(SORT(N) log(&frac;NM))-I/O algorithm for this problem, which we have implemented.We are interested in the union-find problem because of its applications in terrain analysis. A terrain can be abstracted as a height function defined over R2, and many problems that deal with such functions require a union-find data structure. With the emergence of modern mapping technologies, huge amount of elevation data is being generated that is too large to fit in memory, thus I/O-efficient algorithms are needed to process this data efficiently. In this article, we study two terrain-analysis problems that benefit from a union-find data structure: (i) computing topological persistence and (ii) constructing the contour tree. We give the firstO(SORT(N))-I/O algorithms for these two problems, assuming that the input terrain is represented as a triangular mesh withNvertices.", "authors": [{"name": "pankaj k agarwal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100634961"}, {"name": "lars arge", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100153970"}, {"name": "ke yi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100168744"}], "title": "I/O-efficient batched union-find and its applications to terrain analysis", "citations": [{"Name": "Chris Gray ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Frank Kammer ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Maarten L\u00f6ffler ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rodrigo I.

Every strategy for serving a sequence of requests is characterized by a pair of costs and therefore there can be many different minimal or optimal incomparable solutions. The adversary is assumed to choose from one of these minimal strategies and the performance of the algorithm is measured with respect to the costs the adversary pays servicing the sequence according to its determined choice of strategy. We consider a parametric family of functions which includes all the possible selections for such strategies. Then, starting from a simple general method that combines any multicriteria instance into a single-criterion one, we provide a universal multicriteria algorithm that can be applied to different online problems. In the multicriteriak-server formulation with two different edge weightings, for each function class, such a universal algorithm achieves competitive ratios that are only anO(logW) multiplicative factor away from the corresponding determined lower bounds, whereWis the maximum ratio between the two weights associated to each edge. We then extend our results to two specific functions, for which nearly optimal competitive algorithms are obtained by exploiting more knowledge of the selection properties.

The quality of a solution can be measured either by the total distance clients and facilities travel or by the maximum distance traveled by any client or facility. As we show in this article (by an approximation-preserving reduction), the problem of minimizing the total movement of facilities and clients generalizes the classicalk-median problem. The class of movement problems was introduced by Demaine et al. [2007] where a simple 2-approximation was proposed for the minimum maximum movement mobile facility location problem while an approximation for the minimum total movement variant and hardness results for both were left as open problems. Our main result here is an 8-approximation algorithm for the minimum total movement mobile facility location problem. Our algorithm is obtained by rounding an LP relaxation in five phases. For the minimum maximum movement mobile facility location problem, we show that we cannot have a better than a 2-approximation for the problem, unlessP&equals;NPso the simple algorithm proposed by Demaine et al.

The input is a table containing information about a set of entities over a fixed set of attributes and a probability distribution over the set of entities that specifies the likelihood of the occurrence of each entity. The goal is to construct a decision tree that identifies each entity unambiguously by testing the attribute values such that the average number of tests is minimized. This classical problem finds such diverse applications as efficient fault detection, species identification in biology, and efficient diagnosis in the field of medicine. Prior work mainly deals with the special case where the input table is binary and the probability distribution over the set of entities is uniform. We study the general problem involving arbitrary input tables and arbitrary probability distributions over the set of entities. We consider a natural greedy algorithm and prove an approximation guarantee ofO(rK\u22c5 logN), whereNis the number of entities andKis the maximum number of distinct values of an attribute. The valuerKis a suitably defined Ramsey number, which is at most logK. We show that it is NP-hard to approximate the problem within a factor of \u03a9(logN), even for binary tables (i.e.,K&equals;2).

In spite of this, we develop three different methods that need only polylogarithmic time per operation. The first method extends a solution of Farach and Thorup [1998] for the special case of paths. Each merge takesO(log2n) amortized time on ann-node forest and each standard dynamic tree operation takesO(logn) time; the latter bound is amortized, worst case, or randomized depending on the underlying data structure. For the special case that occurs in the motivating application, in which arbitrary arc deletions (cuts) do not occur, we give a method that takesO(logn) time per operation, including merging. This is best possible in a model of computation with an \u03a9(nlogn) lower bound for sortingnnumbers, since such sorting can be done inO(n) tree operations. For the even-more-special case in which there are no cuts and noparentqueries, we give a method that uses standard dynamic trees as a black box: each mergeable tree operation becomes a constant number of standard dynamic tree operations. This third method can also be used in the motivating application, but only by changing the algorithm in the application. Each of our three methods needs different analytical tools and reveals different properties of dynamic trees.", "authors": [{"name": "loukas georgiadis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100307645"}, {"name": "haim kaplan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100155392"}, {"name": "nira shafrir", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100130136"}, {"name": "robert e tarjan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100645220"}, {"name": "renato f werneck", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100563898"}], "title": "Data structures for mergeable trees", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "32\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "877\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "greece", "university": "university of western macedonia", "affiliation_string": "university of western macedonia kozani greece", "city": "kozani", "Name": "loukas georgiadis"}, {"country": "israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "tel-aviv university tel-aviv israel", "city": null, "Name": "haim kaplan"}, {"country": "israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "tel-aviv university tel-aviv israel", "city": null, "Name": "nira shafrir"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "princeton university princeton nj and hewlett-packard laboratories palo alto ca", "city": null, "Name": "robert e tarjan"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research la avenida moutain view ca", "city": null, "Name": "renato f werneck"}]}, "Article No.: 26": {"references": ["Chin, F. and Leung, H. 2005.

Alon et al. (SODA '04) introduced this problem to study online network formation settings and showed that it captures some well-studied problems such as Steiner forest, facility location with nonmetric costs, tree multicast, and group Steiner tree. Obtaining a nontrivial approximation ratio for generalized connectivity was left as an open problem. We describe the first poly-logarithmic approximation algorithm for generalized connectivity that has a performance guarantee ofO(log2nlog2k). Here,nis the number of vertices inGandkis the number of demands. We also prove that the cut-covering relaxation of this problem has anO(log3nlog2k) integrality gap.Building upon the results for generalized connectivity, we obtain improved approximation algorithms for two problems that contain generalized connectivity as a special case.

Another common formulation of this problem is to maximize thegain, that is, the path length reduction achieved by the assignment.In this work we analyze the natural greedy strategy, proving that it reaches the optimal gain up to the constant factor of 2. Considering the gain, we also prove the existence of a PTAS. Finally, we give a polynomial-time 2-approximation for the 1-hotlink assignment problem, which constitutes the first constant factor approximation in terms of the path length.

The memory cells of flash devices can only endure a limited number of write cycles, usually between 10,000 and 1,000,000. Furthermore, cells containing data must beerasedbefore they can store new data, and erasure operations erase large blocks of memory, not individual cells. To maximize the endurance of the device (the amount of useful data that can be written to it before one of its cells wears out), flash-based systems move data around in an attempt to reduce the total number of erasures and to level the wear of the different erase blocks. This data movement introduces an interesting online problem called thewear-leveling problem. Wear-leveling algorithms have been used at least since 1993, but they have never been mathematically analyzed. In this article we analyze the two main wear-leveling problems. We show that a simple randomized algorithm for one of them is essentially optimal both in the competitive sense and in the absolute sense (our competitive result relies on an analysis of a nearly-optimal offline algorithm). We show that deterministic algorithms cannot achieve comparable endurance. We also analyze a more difficult problem and show that offline algorithms for it can improve upon naive approaches, but that online algorithms essentially cannot.", "authors": [{"name": "avraham ben-aroya", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81333487455"}, {"name": "sivan toledo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100036078"}], "title": "Competitive analysis of flash memory algorithms", "citations": [{"Name": "Robert Templeman ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Apu Kapadia", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "35\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "465\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "tel-aviv university tel-aviv israel", "city": null, "Name": "avraham ben-aroya"}, {"country": "israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "tel-aviv university tel-aviv israel", "city": null, "Name": "sivan toledo"}]}, "Article No.: 19": {"references": ["Glencora Borradaile , Philip Klein, AnO(nlogn) algorithm for maximumst-flow in a directed planar graph, Journal of the ACM (JACM), v.56 n.2, p.1-30, April 2009[doi>10.1145/1502793.1502798]\n", "Dijkstra, E.

In many applications, one needs to know the number of occurrences of a given patternwin such sequences, for which we coin the termconstrained pattern matching. For a given wordw, we first estimate the mean and the variance of the number of occurrences ofwin a (d,k) sequence generated by a memoryless source. Then we present the central limit theorem and large deviations results. As a by-product, we enumerate asymptotically the number of (d,k) sequences with exactlyroccurrences ofw, and compute Shannon entropy of (d,k) sequences with a given number of occurrences ofw. We also apply our results to detect under- and overrepresented patterns in neuronal data (spike trains), which satisfy structural constraints that match the framework of (d,k) binary sequences.

The agent has to traverse all nodes and edges of a network (represented as an undirected connected graph), and return to the starting node. Nodes of the network are unlabeled and edge ports are locally labeled at each node. The agent has no a priori knowledge of the topology of the network or of its size, and cannot mark nodes in any way. Under such weak assumptions, cycles in the network may prevent feasibility of exploration, hence we restrict attention to trees. We present an algorithm to accomplish tree exploration (with return) usingO(logn)-bit memory for alln-node trees. This strengthens the result from Diks et al. [2004], whereO(log2n)-bit memory was used for tree exploration, and matches the lower bound on memory size proved there. We also extend ourO(logn)-bit memory traversal mechanism to a weaker model in which ports at each node are ordered in circular manner, however, the explicit values of port numbers are not available.", "authors": [{"name": "christoph ambuhl", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100585843"}, {"name": "leszek gasieniec", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100431314"}, {"name": "andrzej pelc", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100014975"}, {"name": "tomasz radzik", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100189877"}, {"name": "xiaohui zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81336494553"}], "title": "Tree exploration with logarithmic memory", "citations": [{"Name": "Gianlorenzo D'angelo ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gabriele Di Stefano ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alfredo Navarra ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nicolas Nisse ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Karol Suchan", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "18\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "315\n", "Citation Count": "8\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of liverpool", "affiliation_string": "university of liverpool liverpool uk", "city": "liverpool", "Name": "christoph ambuhl"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of liverpool", "affiliation_string": "university of liverpool liverpool uk", "city": "liverpool", "Name": "leszek gasieniec"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "universite du quebec en outaouais", "affiliation_string": "universite du quebec en outaouais gatineau quebec canada", "city": "ottawa", "Name": "andrzej pelc"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "kings college", "affiliation_string": "kings college london london uk", "city": "london", "Name": "tomasz radzik"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of liverpool", "affiliation_string": "university of liverpool liverpool uk", "city": "liverpool", "Name": "xiaohui zhang"}]}, "Article No.: 21": {"references": ["Noga Alon , Yossi Matias , Mario Szegedy, The space complexity of approximating the frequency moments, Journal of Computer and System Sciences, v.58 n.1, p.137-147, Feb. 1999[doi>10.1006/jcss.1997.1545]\n", "Chrisil Arackaparambil , Joshua Brody , Amit Chakrabarti, Functional Monitoring without Monotonicity, Proceedings of the 36th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming: Part I, July 05-12, 2009, Rhodes, Greece[doi>10.1007/978-3-642-02927-1_10]\n", "Brian Babcock , Chris Olston, Distributed top-k monitoring, Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data, June 09-12, 2003, San Diego, California[doi>10.1145/872757.872764]\n", "Ziv Bar-Yossef , T.

The only known algorithm for solving the problem, even for unweighted directed graphs, is the trivial algorithm in which each edge on the path, in its turn, is excluded from the graph and a shortest paths tree is computed froms. The running time isO(mn+n2logn).The replacement paths problem is strongly motivated by two different applications:(1) The fastest algorithm to compute theksimpleshortest paths betweensandtin directed graphs [Yen 1971; Lawler 1972] computes the replacement paths betweensandt. Its running time is\u00d5(mnk).(2) The replacement paths problem is used to compute theVickrey pricingof edges in a distributed network. It was raised as an open problem by Nisan and Ronen [2001] whether it is possible to compute the Vickrey pricing faster thanncomputations of a shortest paths tree.In this article we present the first nontrivial algorithm for computing replacement paths in unweighted directed graphs (and in graphs with small integer weights). Our algorithm is Monte-Carlo and its running time is\u00d5(m\u221an). This result immediately improves the running time of the two applications mentioned above in a factor of \u221an.We also show how to reduce the problem of computingksimple shortest paths betweensandttoO(k) computations of a second simple shortest path fromstoteach time in a different subgraph ofG. The importance of this result is that computing a second simple shortest path may turn out to be an easier problem than computing the replacement paths, thus, we can focus our efforts to improve theksimple shortest paths algorithm in obtaining a faster algorithm for the second shortest path problem.", "authors": [{"name": "liam roditty", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100647832"}, {"name": "uri zwick", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100244628"}], "title": "Replacement paths andksimple shortest paths in unweighted directed graphs", "citations": [{"Name": "Merav Parter ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "David Peleg", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "72\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "11\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "474\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "bar-ilan university israel", "city": null, "Name": "liam roditty"}, {"country": "israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "tel-aviv university israel", "city": null, "Name": "uri zwick"}]}, "Article No.: 37": {"references": ["Romas Aleliunas , Richard M.

Agents are modeled as points, and the route of each of them only depends on its label and on the unknown environment. The actual walk of each agent also depends on an asynchronous adversary that may arbitrarily vary the speed of the agent, stop it, or even move it back and forth, as long as the walk of the agent is continuous, does not leave its route and covers all of it. Meeting in a graph means that both agents must be at the same time in some node or in some point inside an edge of the graph, while meeting in a terrain means that both agents must be at the same time in some point of the terrain. Does there exist a deterministic algorithm that allows any two agents to meet in any unknown environment in spite of this very powerful adversary&quest; We give deterministic rendezvous algorithms for agents starting at arbitrary nodes of any anonymous connected graph (finite or infinite) and for agents starting at any interior points with rational coordinates in any closed region of the plane with path-connected interior. In the geometric scenario agents may have different compasses and different units of length. While our algorithms work in a very general setting -- agents can, indeed, meet almost everywhere -- we show that none of these few limitations imposed on the environment can be removed.

The goal is to maximize throughput. This problem appears naturally in a variety of settings, including parallel query optimization in databases and query processing over Web services.We present anO(n3) algorithm for this problem, given tree-structured precedence constraints on the filters.

Motivated by join operators in database queries, we also give algorithms for versions of the problem in which \u201cfilter\u201d selectivities may be greater than or equal to 1.We prove a strong connection between the more classical problem of minimizing total work in sequential filter ordering (A), and the parallel pipelined filter ordering problem (B). More precisely, we prove thatAis solvable in polynomial time for a given class of precedence constraints if and only ifBis as well. This equivalence allows us to show thatBis NP-Hard in the presence of arbitrary precedence constraints (sinceAis known to be NP-Hard in that setting).", "authors": [{"name": "amol deshpande", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100017246"}, {"name": "lisa hellerstein", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100338606"}], "title": "Parallel pipelined filter ordering with precedence constraints", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "11\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "143\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland college park md", "city": null, "Name": "amol deshpande"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "polytechnic institute of nyu brooklyn ny", "city": "brooklyn", "Name": "lisa hellerstein"}]}, "Article No.: 35": {"references": ["Ittai Abraham , Yair Bartal , T-H.

This ratio is called theprice of anarchy(PoA). In this article, we investigate ways by which one can reduce the performance degradation due to selfish behavior. We investigate two primary methods (a)Stackelberg routing strategies, where a central authority, for example, network manager, controls a fixed fraction of the flow, and can route this flow in any desired way so as to influence the flow of selfish users; and (b)network tolls, where tolls are imposed on the edges to modify the latencies of the edges, and thereby influence the induced Nash equilibrium. We obtain results demonstrating the effectiveness of both Stackelberg strategies and tolls in controlling the price of anarchy.For Stackelberg strategies, we obtain the first results for nonatomic routing in graphs more general than parallel-link graphs, and strengthen existing results for parallel-link graphs. (i) In series-parallel graphs, we show that Stackelberg routing reduces the PoA to a constant (depending on the fraction of flow controlled). (ii) For general graphs, we obtain latency-class specific bounds on the PoA with Stackelberg routing, which give a continuous trade-off between the fraction of flow controlled and the price of anarchy. (iii) In parallel-link graphs, we show that foranygiven classLof latency functions, Stackelberg routing reduces the PoA to at most \u03b1 + (1-\u03b1)&cdot;\u03c1(L), where \u03b1 is the fraction of flow controlled and \u03c1(L) is the PoA of classL(when \u03b1 = 0).For network tolls, motivated by the known strong results for nonatomic games, we consider the more general setting ofatomic splittablerouting games. We show that tolls inducing an optimal flow always exist, even for general asymmetric games with heterogeneous users, and can be computed efficiently by solving aconvex program. This resolves a basic open question about the effectiveness of tolls for atomic splittable games. Furthermore, we give a complete characterization of flows that can be induced via tolls.", "authors": [{"name": "chaitanya swamy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100559824"}], "title": "The effectiveness of stackelberg strategies and tolls for network congestion games", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "22\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "198\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "canada", "university": "university of waterloo", "affiliation_string": "university of waterloo canada", "city": "waterloo", "Name": "chaitanya swamy"}]}, "Article No.: 44": {"references": ["Aldous, D. and Diaconis, P. 1999.

Then, every character is perturbed independently with probabilityp, except thatAis perturbed in exactly the same way inside the two strings.We design two efficient algorithms that compute the edit distance on smoothed instances up to a constant factor approximation. The first algorithm runs in near-linear time, namelyd{1+&epsi;}for any fixed &epsi; > 0. The second one runs in time sublinear ind, assuming the edit distance is not too small. These approximation and runtime guarantees are significantly better than the bounds that were known for worst-case inputs.Our technical contribution is twofold. First, we rely on finding matches between substrings in the two strings, where two substrings are considered a match if their edit distance is relatively small, a prevailing technique in commonly used heuristics, such as PatternHunter of Ma et al. [2002]. Second, we effectively reduce the smoothed edit distance to a simpler variant of (worst-case) edit distance, namely, edit distance on permutations (a.k.a. Ulam's metric). We are thus able to build on algorithms developed for the Ulam metric, whose much better algorithmic guarantees usually do not carry over to general edit distance.", "authors": [{"name": "alexandr andoni", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100260955"}, {"name": "robert krauthgamer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100589176"}], "title": "The smoothed complexity of edit distance", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "27\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "182\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research svc ca", "city": null, "Name": "alexandr andoni"}, {"country": "israel", "university": "weizmann institute of science", "affiliation_string": "the weizmann institute of science israel", "city": "rehovot", "Name": "robert krauthgamer"}]}, "Article No.: 43": {"references": ["Peyman Afshani , Timothy M.

The problem has recently received much attention from the viewpoint of parameterized algorithms. Here, we take a kernelization based approach to thek-Leaf-Out-Branching problem. We give the first polynomial kernel for Rootedk-Leaf-Out-Branching, a variant ofk-Leaf-Out-Branching where the root of the tree searched for is also a part of the input. Our kernel withO(k3) vertices is obtained using extremal combinatorics.For thek-Leaf-Out-Branching problem, we show that no polynomial-sized kernel is possible unlesscoNPis inNP/poly. However, our positive results for Rootedk-Leaf-Out-Branching immediately imply that the seemingly intractablek-Leaf-Out-Branching problem admits a data reduction tonindependent polynomial-sized kernels. These two results, tractability and intractability side by side, are the first ones separatingKarp kernelizationfromTuring kernelization.

This modification allowed us to perform the Measure & Conquer analysis for the time complexity which was not used for graph layout problems before.", "authors": [{"name": "marek cygan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436599894"}, {"name": "marcin pilipczuk", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413606931"}], "title": "Even Faster Exact Bandwidth", "citations": [{"Name": "Gabriela Czibula ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gloria-Cerasela Cri\u015fan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Camelia-M.

The graph-theoretical formulation of the problem is as follows: Given a bipartite graphG= (Vt\u222aVc,E), the task is to find a minimum set of edge modifications such that the resulting graph has no induced path with four edges that starts and ends inVt, whereVtcorresponds to the taxa set andVccorresponds to the character set.We present two fixed-parameter algorithms for theMinimum-Flip Problem, one with running timeO(4.83k+poly(m,n)) and another one with running timeO(4.42k+poly(m,n)) forntaxa,mcharacters,kflips, andpoly(m,n) denotes a polynomial function inmandn.

The performance of such a system (as captured by some objective function over the parameters) is significantly improved if some of these parameters can be probed or observed. In a resource constrained situation, deciding which parameters to observe in order to optimize system performance, itself becomes an interesting and important optimization problem. This general problem is the focus of this article.One of the most important considerations in this framework is whether adaptivity is required for the observations. Adaptive observations introduce blocking or sequential operations in the system whereas nonadaptive observations can be performed in parallel. One of the important questions in this regard is to characterize the benefit of adaptivity for probes and observation.We present general techniques for designing constant factor approximations to the optimal observation schemes for several widely used scheduling and metric objective functions. We show a unifying technique that relates this optimization problem to the outlier version of the corresponding deterministic optimization. By making this connection, our technique shows constant factor upper bounds for the benefit of adaptivity of the observation schemes. We show that while probing yields significant improvement in the objective function, being adaptive about the probing is not beneficial beyond constant factors.", "authors": [{"name": "sudipto guha", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331493787"}, {"name": "kamesh munagala", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100567975"}], "title": "Adaptive Uncertainty Resolution in Bayesian Combinatorial Optimization Problems", "citations": [{"Name": "Tanmoy Chakraborty ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Eyal Even-Dar ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sudipto Guha ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yishay Mansour ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "S.

The quality of service is considered in the framework of adversarial queuing. An adversary is determined by injection rate and burstiness, the latter denoting the number of packets that can be injected simultaneously in a round. We consider only injection rates that are less than 1. A protocol is stable when the numbers of packets in queues stay bounded at all rounds, and it is of fair latency when waiting times of packets in queues areO(burstiness/rate). For channels with collision detection, we give a full-sensing protocol of fair latency for injection rates that are at most 1 2(\u2308lgn\u2309 + 1), wherenis the number of stations, and show that fair latency is impossible to achieve for injection rates that are\u03c9(1 logn). For channels without collision detection, we present a full-sensing protocol of fair latency for injection rates that are at most 1clg2n, for somec> 0. We show that there exists an acknowledgment-based protocol that has fair latency for injection rates that are at most 1cnlg2n, for somec> 0, and develop an explicit acknowledgment-based protocol of fair latency for injection rates that are at most 1 27n2lnn. Regarding impossibility to achieve just stability by restricted protocols, we prove that no acknowledgment-based protocol can be stable for injection rates larger than 3 1 + lgn.", "authors": [{"name": "bogdan s chlebus", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81410592212"}, {"name": "dariusz r kowalski", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100168367"}, {"name": "mariusz a rokicki", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81315491115"}], "title": "Adversarial Queuing on the Multiple Access Channel", "citations": [{"Name": "Lakshmi Anantharamu ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bogdan S.

Our first algorithm handlesmarc additions in O(m3/2) time. For sparse graphs (m/n= O(1)), this bound improves the best previous bound by a logarithmic factor, and is tight to within a constant factor among algorithms satisfying a natural locality property. Our second algorithm handles an arbitrary sequence of arc additions in O(n5/2) time. For sufficiently dense graphs, this bound improves the best previous bound by a polynomial factor. Our bound may be far from tight: we show that the algorithm can take \u03a9(n22\u221a2 lgn) time by relating its performance to a generalization of thek-levels problem of combinatorial geometry. A completely different algorithm running in \u0398(n2logn) time was given recently by Bender, Fineman, and Gilbert.

Nevertheless, these algorithms use an optimal amount of work and move data optimally among multiple levels of cache.

This problem is closely related to tour problems such as TSP as well as network design problems such ask-MST. Orienteering withtime-windowsis the more general problem in which each nodevhas a specified time-window [R(v),D(v)] and a nodevis counted as visited by the walk only ifvis visited during its time-window. We design new and improved algorithms for the orienteering problem and orienteering with time-windows.

One common method for saving energy is to simply suspend the system during idle times. No energy is consumed in the suspend mode. However, the process of waking up the system itself requires a certain fixed amount of energy, and thus suspending the system is beneficial only if the idle time is long enough to compensate for this additional energy expenditure. In the specific problem studied in the article, we have a set of jobs with release times and deadlines that need to be executed on a single processor. Preemptions are allowed. The processor requires energyLto be woken up and, when it is on, it uses one unit of energy per one unit of time. It has been an open problem whether a schedule minimizing the overall energy consumption can be computed in polynomial time. We solve this problem in positive, by providing anO(n5)-time algorithm. In addition we provide anO(n4)-time algorithm for computing the minimum energy schedule when all jobs have unit length.", "authors": [{"name": "philippe baptiste", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100246374"}, {"name": "marek chrobak", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100209967"}, {"name": "christoph durr", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100013554"}], "title": "Polynomial-time algorithms for minimum energy scheduling", "citations": [{"Name": "Jeremy T.

Motivated by such a negative result, we focus on the study of the states (not necessarily being equilibria) reached after a limited number of players' selfish moves, and we show that \u0398(nlog logn) best responses are necessary and sufficient to achieve states that approximate the optimal solution by a constant factor, under the assumption that everyO(n) steps each player performs a constant (and nonnull) number of best responses.

All the requests from a particular client should be assigned to one server because of the routing protocol used. The goal is to minimize the total cost of these assignments\u2014cost of each is proportional to the distance between the client and the server as well as the request size\u2014while the load on each server is kept below its bandwidth limit. When each server also has a setup cost, this is anunsplittable hard-capacitated facility location problem. As much attention as facility location problems have received, there has been no nontrivial approximation algorithm when we have hard capacities (i.e., there can only be one copy of each facility whose capacity cannot be violated) and demands are unsplittable (i.e., all the demand from a client has to be assigned to a single facility). We observe it is NP-hard to approximate the cost to within any bounded factor in this case. Thus, for an arbitrary constant &epsi;>0, we relax the capacities to a 1+&epsi; factor. For the case where capacities arealmost uniform, we give a bicriteriaO(logn, 1+&epsi;)-approximation algorithm for general metrics and a (1+&epsi;, 1+&epsi;)-approximation algorithm for tree metrics. A bicriteria (\u03b1,\u03b2)-approximation algorithm produces a solution of cost at most \u03b1 times the optimum, while violating the capacities by no more than a \u03b2 factor. We can get the same guarantees for nonuniform capacities if we allow quasipolynomial running time. In our algorithm, some clientsguessthe facility they are assigned to, and facilitiesdecidethe size of the clients they serve. A straightforward approach results in exponential running time. When costs do not satisfy metricity, we show that a 1.5 violation of capacities is necessary to obtain any approximation.It is worth noting that our results generalize bin packing (zero connection costs and facility costs equal to one), knapsack (single facility with all costs being zero), minimum makespan scheduling for related machines (all connection costs being zero), and some facility location problems.", "authors": [{"name": "mohammadhossein bateni", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81492647003"}, {"name": "mohammadtaghi hajiaghayi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81492647790"}], "title": "Assignment problem in content distribution networks: Unsplittable hard-capacitated facility location", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "52\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "13\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "381\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "princeton university ny", "city": null, "Name": "mohammadhossein bateni"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "at t labsresearch nj", "city": null, "Name": "mohammadtaghi hajiaghayi"}]}, "Article No.: 24": {"references": ["Ron Aharoni , Penny Haxell, Hall's theorem for hypergraphs, Journal of Graph Theory, v.35 n.2, p.83-88, October 2000[doi>10.1002/1097-0118(200010)35:2<>1.0.CO;2-4]\n", "Arash Asadpour , Uriel Feige , Amin Saberi, Santa Claus Meets Hypergraph Matchings, Proceedings of the 11th international workshop, APPROX 2008, and 12th international workshop, RANDOM 2008 on Approximation, Randomization and Combinatorial Optimization: Algorithms and Techniques, August 25-27, 2008, Boston, MA, USA[doi>10.1007/978-3-540-85363-3_2]\n", "Arash Asadpour , Amin Saberi, An Approximation Algorithm for Max-Min Fair Allocation of Indivisible Goods, SIAM Journal on Computing, v.39 n.7, p.2970-2989, May 2010[doi>10.1137/080723491]\n", "Nikhil Bansal , Maxim Sviridenko, The Santa Claus problem, Proceedings of the thirty-eighth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing, May 21-23, 2006, Seattle, WA, USA[doi>10.1145/1132516.1132522]\n", "Ivona Bez\u00e1kov\u00e1 , Varsha Dani, Allocating indivisible goods, ACM SIGecom Exchanges, v.5 n.3, p.11-18, April 2005[doi>10.1145/1120680.1120683]\n", "Brams, S. and Taylor, A.

It was previously shown via a nonconstructive proof that uses the Lov\u00e1sz local lemma that the integrality gap of a certain configuration LP for the problem is no worse than some (unspecified) constant. This gives a polynomial-time algorithm to estimate the optimum value of the problem within a constant factor, but does not provide a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a corresponding allocation.We use a different approach to analyze the integrality gap. Our approach is based upon local search techniques for finding perfect matchings in certain classes of hypergraphs. As a result, we prove that the integrality gap of the configuration LP is no worse than 1/4.

In this game we have a set of selfish node players, each creating some incident links, and the goal is to minimize \u03b1 times the cost of the created links plus sum of the distances to all other players. Fabrikant et al. proved an upper boundO(&sqrt;\u03b1) on the price of anarchy: the relative cost of the lack of coordination. Albers, Eilts, Even-Dar, Mansour, and Roditty show that the price of anarchy is constant for \u03b1 =O(&sqrt;n) and for \u03b1 &geq; 12n\u2308 lgn\u2309, and that the price of anarchy is 15(1+(min{\u03b12/n,n2/\u03b1})1/3) for any \u03b1. The latter bound shows the first sublinear worst-case bound,O(n1/3), for all \u03b1. But no better bound is known for \u03b1 between \u03c9(&sqrt;n) ando(nlgn).Yet \u03b1 &approx;nis perhaps the most interesting range, for it corresponds to considering the average distance (instead of the sum of distances) to other nodes to be roughly on par with link creation (effectively dividing \u03b1 byn). In this article, we prove the firsto(n\u03b5) upper bound for general \u03b1, namely 2O(&sqrt; lgn). We also prove a constant upper bound for \u03b1 =O(n1-\u03b5) for any fixed \u03b5 > 0, substantially reducing the range of \u03b1 for which constant bounds have not been obtained. Along the way, we also improve the constant upper bound by Albers et al. (with the lead constant of15) to6for \u03b1 < (n/2)1/2and to4for \u03b1 < (n/2)1/3. Next we consider the bilateral network variant of Corbo and Parkes, in which links can be created only with the consent of both endpoints and the link price is shared equally by the two. Corbo and Parkes show an upper bound ofO(&sqrt;\u03b1) and a lower bound of \u03a9(lg\u03b1) for \u03b1 &leq;n. In this article, we show that in fact the upper boundO(&sqrt;\u03b1) is tight for \u03b1 &leq;n, by proving a matching lower bound of \u03a9(&sqrt;\u03b1). For \u03b1 >n, we prove that the price of anarchy is \u0398(n/&sqrt; \u03b1).Finally we introduce a variant of both network creation games, in which each player desires to minimize \u03b1 times the cost of its created links plus the maximum distance (instead of the sum of distances) to the other players. This variant of the problem is naturally motivated by considering the worst case instead of the average case. Interestingly, for the original (unilateral) game, we show that the price of anarchy is at most2for \u03b1 &geq;n,O(min {4&sqrt;lgn, (n/\u03b1)1/3}) for 2&sqrt; lgn&leq; \u03b1 &leq;n, andO(n2/\u03b1) for \u03b1 < 2&sqrt; lgn.For the bilateral game, we prove matching upper and lower bounds of \u0398(n/\u03b1 + 1) for \u03b1 &leq;n, and an upper bound of2for \u03b1 >n.", "authors": [{"name": "erik d demaine", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100553346"}, {"name": "mohammadtaghi hajiaghayi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81492647790"}, {"name": "hamid mahini", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81322500275"}, {"name": "morteza zadimoghaddam", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331508133"}], "title": "The price of anarchy in network creation games", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "19\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "221\n", "Citation Count": "5\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "mit ma", "city": null, "Name": "erik d demaine"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "att labs --- research nj", "city": null, "Name": "mohammadtaghi hajiaghayi"}, {"country": "iran", "university": "sharif university of technology", "affiliation_string": "sharif university of technology iran", "city": "tehran", "Name": "hamid mahini"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "mit ma", "city": null, "Name": "morteza zadimoghaddam"}]}, "Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Blasiak, J. and Durrett, R. 2005.

Its main feature is that it provides constant worst-case search time. The aim of this article is to present a precise average case analysis of Cuckoo hashing. In particular, we determine the probability that Cuckoo hashing produces no conflicts and give an upper bound for the construction time, that is linear in the size of the table. The analysis rests on a generating function approach to the so called Cuckoo Graph, a random bipartite graph, and an application of a double saddle point method to obtain asymptotic expansions. Furthermore, we provide some results concerning the structure of these kinds of random graphs. Our results extend the analysis of Devroye and Morin [2003].

A widely accepted definition of useful data reduction is that of a polynomial kernelization where the output instance is guaranteed to be of size polynomial in some parameter of the input. The fairly recent development of a framework for kernelization lower bounds has made this notion even more attractive as we can now classify many problems into admitting or not admitting polynomial kernelizations. The central notion of the framework is that of a polynomial-time composition algorithm due to Bodlaender et al. (ICALP 2008, JSCC 2009): giventinput instances, anor-composition algorithm returns a single-output instance with bounded parameter value that is yes if and only if one oftinput instances is yes; it encodes the logical OR of the input instances. Based on a result of Fortnow and Santhanam (STOC 2008, JSCC 2011), Bodlaender et al. show that anor-composition for an NP-hard problem rules out polynomial kernelizations for it unless NP \u2286 coNP/poly (which is known to imply a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy). It is implicit in the work of Fortnow and Santhanam that even co-nondeterministic composition algorithms suffice to rule out polynomial kernelizations. This was first observed in unpublished work of Chen and M\u00fcller, and it is an explicit conclusion of recent results by Dell and van Melkebeek (STOC 2010). However, in contrast to the numerous applications of deterministic composition, the added power of co-nondeterminism has not yet been harnessed to obtain kernelization lower bounds.In this work, we present the first example of how co-nondeterminism can help to make a composition algorithm. We study the existence of polynomial kernels for a Ramsey-type problem where, given a graphGand an integerk, the question is whetherGcontains an independent set or a clique of size at leastk. It was asked by Rod Downey whether this problem admits a polynomial kernelization with respect tok; such a result would greatly speed up the computation of Ramsey numbers. We provide a co-nondeterministic composition based on embedding t instances into a single host graphH. The crux is that the host graphHneeds to observe a bound of &ell; \u2208O(logt) on both its maximum independent set and maximum clique size, while also having a cover of its vertex set by independent sets and cliques all of size &ell;; the co-nondeterministic composition is built around the search for such graphs. Thus, we show that, unless NP \u2286 coNP/poly, the problem does not admit a kernelization with polynomial size guarantee.", "authors": [{"name": "stefan kratsch", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81438598103"}], "title": "Co-Nondeterminism in Compositions: A Kernelization Lower Bound for a Ramsey-Type Problem", "citations": [{"Name": "Bart M.

In a breakthrough result, Reed, Smith, and Vetta (Operations Research Letters, 2004) gave aO(4kkmn) time algorithm for it; this also implies that instances of the problem can be reduced to a so-called problem kernel of sizeO(4k). Since then, the existence of a polynomial kernel for OCT (i.e., a kernelization with size bounded polynomially ink) has turned into one of the main open questions in the study of kernelization, open even for the special case of planar input graphs.This work provides the first (randomized) polynomial kernelization for OCT. We introduce a novel kernelization approach based on matroid theory, where we encode all relevant information about a problem instance into a matroid with a representation of size polynomial ink. This represents the first application of matroid theory to kernelization.", "authors": [{"name": "stefan kratsch", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81438598103"}, {"name": "magnus wahlstrom", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100192016"}], "title": "Compression via Matroids: A Randomized Polynomial Kernel for Odd Cycle Transversal", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "64\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "118\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "El Salvador", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "technical university berlin germany", "city": "berlin", "Name": "stefan kratsch"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "max-planck-institute for informatics", "city": null, "Name": "magnus wahlstrom"}]}, "Article No.: 18": {"references": ["W.

We consider a wireless network consisting of a set ofnhonest and reliable nodes within transmission (and interference) range of each other, and we model the external disruptions with a powerful adaptive adversary. This adversary may know the protocol and its entire history and can use this knowledge to jam the wireless channel at will at any time. It is allowed to jam a (1-&epsi;)-fraction of the timesteps, for an arbitrary constant &epsi; > 0 unknown to the nodes. The nodes cannot distinguish between the adversarial jamming or a collision of two or more messages that are sent at the same time. We demonstrate, for the first time, that there is a local-control MAC protocol requiring only very limited knowledge about the adversary and the network that achieves a constant (asymptotically optimal) throughput for the nonjammed time periods under any of the aforementioned adversarial strategies. The derived principles are also useful to build robust applications on top of the MAC layer, and we present an exemplary study for leader election, one of the most fundamental tasks in distributed computing.", "authors": [{"name": "baruch awerbuch", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100453798"}, {"name": "andrea richa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309493720"}, {"name": "christian scheideler", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82459277157"}, {"name": "stefan schmid", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100145296"}, {"name": "jin zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81466646778"}], "title": "Principles of Robust Medium Access and an Application to Leader Election", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "40\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "104\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Belize", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the johns hopkins university baltimore md", "city": "hopkins", "Name": "baruch awerbuch"}, {"country": "Grenada", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "arizona state university tempe az", "city": "tempe", "Name": "andrea richa"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of paderborn paderborn germany", "city": "paderborn", "Name": "christian scheideler"}, {"country": "El Salvador", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "telekom innovation laboratories t-labs  tu berlin germany", "city": "berlin", "Name": "stefan schmid"}, {"country": "Grenada", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "arizona state university tempe az", "city": "tempe", "Name": "jin zhang"}]}, "Article No.: 17": {"references": ["Nir Ailon , Bernard Chazelle, Information theory in property testing and monotonicity testing in higher dimension, Information and Computation, v.204 n.11, p.1704-1717, November 2006[doi>10.1016/j.ic.2006.06.001]\n", "Noga Alon , Michael Krivelevich, Testingk-colorability, SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics, v.15 n.2, p.211-227, 2002[doi>10.1137/S0895480199358655]\n", "Tu\u011fkan Batu , Ronitt Rubinfeld , Patrick White, Fast approximate PCPs for multidimensional bin-packing problems, Information and Computation, v.196 n.1, p.42-56, January 10, 2005[doi>10.1016/j.ic.2004.10.001]\n", "Arnab Bhattacharyya , Elena Grigorescu , Kyomin Jung , Sofya Raskhodnikova , David P.

Specifically, in the model studied by Raskhodnikova, the distance that an image has to a specific property is the number of entries that should be modified in the corresponding matrix so that the property can be obtained, divided by the total number of entries:n2. In the model we consider, the distance is the number of entries that should be modified divided by the actual number of 1\u2019s in the matrix, which may be much smaller thann2.

In this problem, we are given a set ofntasks, each specified by a start timesi, an end timeti, a demanddi> 0, and a profitpi> 0. A task, if accepted, requiresdiunits of \u201cbandwidth\u201d from timesitotiand accrues a profit ofpi. For every timet, we are also specified the available bandwidthct, and the goal is to find a subset of tasks with maximum profit subject to the bandwidth constraints.We present the first polynomial timeO(logn) approximation algorithm for this problem. This significantly advances the state of the art, as no polynomial timeo(n) approximation was known previously. Previous results for this problem were known only in more restrictive settings; in particular, either the instance satisfies the so-called \u201cno-bottleneck\u201d assumption: maxidi\u2264 mintct, or the ratio of both maximum to minimum demands and maximum to minimum capacities are polynomially (or quasi-polynomially) bounded inn. Our result, on the other hand, does not require these assumptions.Our algorithm is based on a combination of dynamic programming and rounding a natural linear programming relaxation for the problem. While there is an \u03a9(n) integrality gap known for this LP relaxation, our key idea is to exploit certain structural properties of the problem to show that instances that are bad for the LP can in fact be handled using dynamic programming.", "authors": [{"name": "nikhil bansal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100204613"}, {"name": "zachary friggstad", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435603017"}, {"name": "rohit khandekar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81335492568"}, {"name": "mohammad r salavatipour", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100029685"}], "title": "A logarithmic approximation for unsplittable flow on line graphs", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "21\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "132\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "netherlands", "university": "eindhoven university of technology", "affiliation_string": "eindhoven university of technology yorktown heights ny", "city": "eindhoven", "Name": "nikhil bansal"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of waterloo", "affiliation_string": "university of waterloo alberta canada", "city": "waterloo", "Name": "zachary friggstad"}, {"country": "Jersey", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm t j watson research center jersey city nj usa", "city": "jersey", "Name": "rohit khandekar"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of alberta", "affiliation_string": "university of alberta edmonton alberta canada", "city": "edmonton", "Name": "mohammad r salavatipour"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["P.

For the linear matroid parity problem, we obtain a simple randomized algorithm with running timeO(mr\u03c9-1), wheremandrare the number of columns and the number of rows, respectively, and \u03c9 &ap; 2.3727 is the matrix multiplication exponent. This improves theO(mr\u03c9)-time algorithm by Gabow and Stallmann and matches the running time of the algebraic algorithm for linear matroid intersection, answering a question of Harvey. We also present a very simple alternative algorithm with running timeO(mr2), which does not need fast matrix multiplication.We further improve the algebraic algorithms for some specific graph problems of interest. For the Mader\u2019s disjointS-path problem, we present anO(n\u03c9)-time randomized algorithm wherenis the number of vertices. This improves the running time of the existing results considerably and matches the running time of the algebraic algorithms for graph matching. For the graphic matroid parity problem, we give anO(n4)-time randomized algorithm wherenis the number of vertices, and anO(n3)-time randomized algorithm for a special case useful in designing approximation algorithms. These algorithms are optimal in terms ofnas the input size could be \u03a9 (n4) and \u03a9 (n3), respectively.The techniques are based on the algebraic algorithmic framework developed by Mucha and Sankowski, Harvey, and Sankowski. While linear matroid parity and Mader\u2019s disjointS-path are challenging generalizations for the design of combinatorial algorithms, our results show that both the algebraic algorithms for linear matroid intersection and graph matching can be extended nicely to more general settings. All algorithms are still faster than the existing algorithms even if fast matrix multiplication is not used.

It is known that anyn-node static tree can be represented in 2n&plus;o(n) bits so that a number of operations on the tree can be supported in constant time under the word-RAM model. However, the data structures are complicated and difficult to dynamize. We propose a simple and flexible data structure, called therange min-max tree, that reduces the large number of relevant tree operations considered in the literature to a few primitives that are carried out in constant time on polylog-sized trees. The result is extended to trees of arbitrary size, retaining constant time and reaching 2n&plus;O(n/polylog(n)) bits of space. This space is optimal for a core subset of the operations supported and significantly lower than in any previous proposal.For the dynamic case, where insertion/deletion (indels) of nodes is allowed, the existing data structures support a very limited set of operations. Our data structure builds on the range min-max tree to achieve 2n&plus;O(n/logn) bits of space andO(logn) time for all operations supported in the static scenario, plus indels. We also propose an improved data structure using 2n&plus;O(nlog logn/logn) bits and improving the time to the optimalO(logn/log logn) for most operations. We extend our support to forests, where whole subtrees can be attached to or detached from others, in timeO(log1&plus;&epsi;n) for any &epsi; > 0. Such operations had not been considered before.Our techniques are of independent interest. An immediate derivation yields an improved solution to range minimum/maximum queries where consecutive elements differ by \u00b1 1, achievingn&plus;O(n/polylog(n)) bits of space. A second one stores an array of numbers supporting operationssumandsearchand limited updates, in optimal timeO(logn/log logn). A third one allows representing dynamic bitmaps and sequences over alphabets of size \u03c3, supporting rank/select and indels, within zero-order entropy bounds and timeO(lognlog \u03c3/(log logn)2) for all operations. This time is the optimalO(logn/log logn) on bitmaps and polylog-sized alphabets. This improves upon the best existing bounds for entropy-bounded storage of dynamic sequences, compressed full-text self-indexes, and compressed-space construction of the Burrows-Wheeler transform.", "authors": [{"name": "gonzalo navarro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100113887"}, {"name": "kunihiko sadakane", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100636624"}], "title": "Fully Functional Static and Dynamic Succinct Trees", "citations": [{"Name": "Meng He ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "J.

For node-weighted Steiner tree, a classical network-optimization problem, the best achievable approximation ratio in general graphs is \u0398 (logn), and nothing better was previously known for planar graphs. We give a constant-factor approximation for planar graphs. Our algorithm generalizes to allow as input any nontrivial minor-closed graph family, and also generalizes to address other optimization problems such as Steiner forest, prize-collecting Steiner tree, and network-formation games.The second problem we address is group Steiner tree: given a graph with edge weights and a collection of groups (subsets of nodes), find a minimum-weight connected subgraph that includes at least one node from each group. The best approximation ratio known in general graphs isO(log3n), orO(log2n) when the host graph is a tree. We obtain anO(lognpolyloglogn) approximation algorithm for the special case where the graph is planar embedded and each group is the set of nodes on a face. We obtain the same approximation ratio for the minimum-weight tour that must visit each group.", "authors": [{"name": "erik d demaine", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100553346"}, {"name": "mohammadtaghi hajiaghayi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100596923"}, {"name": "philip n klein", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331496042"}], "title": "Node-Weighted Steiner Tree and Group Steiner Tree in Planar Graphs", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "73\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "165\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "massachusetts institute of technology cambridge ma", "city": "cambridge", "Name": "erik d demaine"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland college park md", "city": null, "Name": "mohammadtaghi hajiaghayi"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "brown university providence ri", "city": "providence", "Name": "philip n klein"}]}, "Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Anil Ada , Arkadev Chattopadhyay , Stephen Cook , Lila Fontes , Michal Koucky , Toniann Pitassi, The Hardness of Being Private, Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity (CCC), p.192-202, June 26-29, 2012[doi>10.1109/CCC.2012.24]\n", "Moshe Babaioff , Liad Blumrosen , Moni Naor , Michael Schapira, Informational overhead of incentive compatibility, Proceedings of the 9th ACM conference on Electronic commerce, July 08-12, 2008, Chicago, Il, USA[doi>10.1145/1386790.1386807]\n", "R.

We formulate communication-complexity-based definitions, both worst case and average case, of a problem\u2019sprivacy-approximation ratio. We use our definitions to investigate the extent to which approximate privacy is achievable in a number of standard problems: the 2nd-price Vickrey auction, Yao\u2019s millionaires problem, the public-good problem, and the set-theoretic disjointness and intersection problems.For both the 2nd-price Vickrey auction and the millionaires problem, we show that not only is perfect privacy impossible or infeasibly costly to achieve, but evenclose approximationsof perfect privacy suffer from the same lower bounds. By contrast, if the inputs are drawn uniformly at random from &lcub; 0,\u2026, 2k-1&rcub;, then, for both problems, simple and natural communication protocols have privacy-approximation ratios that are linear ink(i.e., logarithmic in the size of the input space). We also demonstrate tradeoffs between privacy and communication in a family of auction protocols.We show that the privacy-approximation ratio provided by any protocol for the disjointness and intersection problems is necessarily exponential (ink). We also use these ratios to argue that one protocol for each of these problems is significantly fairer than the others we consider (in the sense of relative effects on the privacy of the different players).", "authors": [{"name": "joan feigenbaum", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100346986"}, {"name": "aaron d jaggard", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100523589"}, {"name": "michael schapira", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100035484"}], "title": "Approximate Privacy: Foundations and Quantification", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "59\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "201\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "yale university new haven ct", "city": "new haven", "Name": "joan feigenbaum"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "rutgers university", "city": null, "Name": "aaron d jaggard"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "yale university and uc berkeley berkeley", "city": null, "Name": "michael schapira"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["David Abraham. 2003.

Executing jobs at high speeds and then setting the processor asleep is an approach that can lead to further energy savings compared to standard dynamic speed scaling. We consider classical deadline-based scheduling, that is, each job is specified by a release time, a deadline and a processing volume. For general convex power functions, Irani et al. [2007] devised an offline 2-approximation algorithm. Roughly speaking, the algorithm schedules jobs at a critical speedscritthat yields the smallest energy consumption while jobs are processed. For power functionsP(s) =s\u03b1& \u03b3, wheresis the processor speed, Han et al. [2010] gave an \u03b1\u03b1&plus; 2)-competitive online algorithm.We investigate the offline setting of speed scaling with a sleep state. First, we prove NP-hardness of the optimization problem. Additionally, we develop lower bounds, for general convex power functions: No algorithm that constructsscrit-schedules, which execute jobs at speeds of at leastscrit, can achieve an approximation factor smaller than 2. Furthermore, no algorithm that minimizes the energy expended for processing jobs can attain an approximation ratio smaller than 2.We then present an algorithmic framework for designing good approximation algorithms. For general convex power functions, we derive an approximation factor of 4/3. For power functionsP(s) = \u03b2s\u03b1&plus; \u03b3, we obtain an approximation of 137/117 > 1.171. We finally show that our framework yields the best approximation guarantees for the class ofscrit-schedules. For general convex power functions, we give another 2-approximation algorithm. For functionsP(s) = \u03b2s\u03b1&plus; \u03b3, we present tight upper and lower bounds on the best possible approximation factor. The ratio is exactlyeW\u22121(\u2212e\u22121\u22121/e)/(eW\u22121(\u2212e\u22121\u22121/e)&plus;1)> 1.211, whereW-1is the lower branch of the LambertWfunction.", "authors": [{"name": "susanne albers", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100626662"}, {"name": "antonios antoniadis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453643006"}], "title": "Race to idle: New algorithms for speed scaling with a sleep state", "citations": [{"Name": "Jian-Jia Chen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mong-Jen Kao ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "D.T.

Our technique applies to general families of problems where standard dynamic programming runs in 2O(k\u22c5logk)\u22c5nsteps. Our approach combines tools from topological graph theory and analytic combinatorics. In particular, we introduce a new type of branch decomposition calledsurface cut decomposition, generalizing sphere cut decompositions of planar graphs, which has nice combinatorial properties. Namely, the number of partial solutions that can be arranged on a surface cut decomposition can be upper-bounded by the number of noncrossing partitions on surfaces with boundary. It follows that partial solutions can be represented by a single-exponential (in the branchwidthk) number of configurations. This proves that, when applied on surface cut decompositions, dynamic programming runs in 2O(k)\u22c5nsteps. That way, we considerably extend the class of problems that can be solved in running times with asingle-exponential dependenceon branchwidth and unify/improve most previous results in this direction.", "authors": [{"name": "juanjo rue", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81472656205"}, {"name": "ignasi sau", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436596526"}, {"name": "dimitrios m thilikos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100042858"}], "title": "Dynamic programming for graphs on surfaces", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "45\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "283\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ignasi sau", "city": null, "Name": "juanjo rue"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "dimitrios m thilikos", "city": null, "Name": "cnrs-lirmm montpellier france"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Nir Ailon , Moses Charikar , Alantha Newman, Aggregating inconsistent information: ranking and clustering, Proceedings of the thirty-seventh annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing, May 22-24, 2005, Baltimore, MD, USA[doi>10.1145/1060590.1060692]\n", "A.

Although Dodgson\u2019s rule is one of the most well-studied voting rules, it suffers from serious deficiencies, both from the computational point of view\u2014it is NP-hard even to approximate the Dodgson score within sublogarithmic factors\u2014and from the social choice point of view\u2014it fails basic social choice desiderata such as monotonicity and homogeneity. However, this does not preclude the existence of approximation algorithms for Dodgson that are monotonic or homogeneous, and indeed it is natural to ask whether such algorithms exist.In this article, we give definitive answers to these questions. We design a monotonic exponential-time algorithm that yields a 2-approximation to the Dodgson score, while matching this result with a tight lower bound. We also present a monotonic polynomial-time O(logm)-approximation algorithm (wheremis the number of alternatives); this result is tight as well due to a complexity-theoretic lower bound. Furthermore, we show that a slight variation on a known voting rule yields a monotonic, homogeneous, polynomial-time O(mlogm)-approximation algorithm and establish that it is impossible to achieve a better approximation ratio even if one just asks for homogeneity. We complete the picture by studying several additional social choice properties; for these properties, we prove that algorithms with an approximation ratio that depends only onmdo not exist.", "authors": [{"name": "ioannis caragiannis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100566963"}, {"name": "christos kaklamanis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100644646"}, {"name": "nikos karanikolas", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435595500"}, {"name": "ariel d procaccia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81318490750"}], "title": "Socially desirable approximations for dodgson\u2019s voting rule", "citations": [{"Name": "Simina Br\u00e2nzei ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ioannis Caragiannis ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jamie Morgenstern ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ariel D.

Our protocols converge to an allocation that is a logarithmic approximation, simultaneously, to all canonical social welfare functions (i.e., functions that are symmetric, concave, and nondecreasing). These protocols can be started in an arbitrary state. Although a similar protocol was known before, it only applied to the simple bandwidth allocation problem, and its stability and convergence time were not understood. In contrast, our protocols also apply to the more general case of Leontief utilities, where each user may place a different requirement on each resource. Furthermore, we prove that our protocols converge in polynomial time. The best convergence time we prove isO(nlogncMAXaMAX/cMINaMIN), wherenis the number of agents in the network,cMAXandcMINare the maximum and minimum capacity of the links, andamax,aminare respectively the largest and smallest Leontief coefficients. This time is achieved by a simple Multiplicative Increase, Multiplicative Decrease (MIMD) protocol that had not been studied before in this setting. We also identify combinatorial properties of these protocols that may be useful in proving stronger convergence bounds. The final allocations by our protocols are supported by usage-sensitive dual prices that are fair in the sense that they shield light users of a resource from the impact of heavy users. Thus, our protocols can also be thought of as efficient distributed schemes for computing fair prices.", "authors": [{"name": "ashish goel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100051343"}, {"name": "hamid nazerzadeh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331500078"}], "title": "Price-based protocols for fair resource allocation: Convergence time analysis and extension to leontief utilities", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "14\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "161\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "stanford university ca", "city": null, "Name": "ashish goel"}, {"country": "Hong Kong", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of southern california los angeles ca", "city": "southern", "Name": "hamid nazerzadeh"}]}}, "date": {"month": "February", "year": "2014"}}}, "Volume3": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Article No.: 40": {"references": ["Archer, A., Levin, A., and Williamson, D.

Unlike skip lists or other tree data structures, skip graphs are highly resilient, tolerating a large fraction of failed nodes without losing connectivity. In addition, simple and straightforward algorithms can be used to construct a skip graph, insert new nodes into it, search it, and detect and repair errors within it introduced due to node failures.", "authors": [{"name": "james aspnes", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100480132"}, {"name": "gauri shah", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100650949"}], "title": "Skip graphs", "citations": [{"Name": "Thomas Clouser ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mikhail Nesterenko ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Christian Scheideler", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kohichi Kohigashi ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kentaro Takahashi ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kaname Harumoto ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shojiro Nishio", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "A Peer-to-Peer Information Sharing Method for RDF Triples Based on RDF Schema", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rizal Mohd Nor ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mikhail Nesterenko ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Christian Scheideler", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marcin Bienkowski ", "Country": "tunisia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andr\u00e9 Brinkmann ", "Country": "tunisia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marek Klonowski ", "Country": "tunisia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Miroslaw Korzeniowski", "Country": "tunisia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Riko Jacob ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andrea Richa ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Christian Scheideler ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Stefan Schmid ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hanjo T\u00e4ubig", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "T.

Comparatively little is known about oblivious routing in generaldirectednetworks, or even in undirected networks with node capacities.We present the first nontrivial upper bounds for both these cases, providing algorithms fork-commodity oblivious routing problems with competitive ratioO(&sqrt;klog(n)) for undirected node-capacitated graphs andO(&sqrt;kn1/4log(n)) for directed graphs. In the special case that all commodities have a common source or sink, our upper bound becomesO(&sqrt;nlog(n)) in both cases, matching the lower bound up to a factor of log(n). The lower bound (which first appeared in Azar et al. [2003]) is obtained on a graph with very high degree. We show that, in fact, the degree of a graph is a crucial parameter for node-capacitated oblivious routing in undirected graphs, by providing anO(\u0394 polylog(n))-competitive oblivious routing scheme for graphs of degree \u0394. For the directed case, however, we show that the lower bound of \u03a9(&sqrt;n) still holds in low-degree graphs.Finally, we settle an open question about routing problems in which all commodities share a common source or sink. We show that even in this simplified scenario there are networks in which no oblivious routing algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio better than \u03a9(logn).", "authors": [{"name": "mohammad taghi hajiaghayi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100596923"}, {"name": "robert d kleinberg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100287473"}, {"name": "harald racke", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100337999"}, {"name": "tom leighton", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100605223"}], "title": "Oblivious routing on node-capacitated and directed graphs", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "14\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "342\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "att labs-- research florham park nj", "city": null, "Name": "mohammad taghi hajiaghayi"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cornell university ithaca new york", "city": null, "Name": "robert d kleinberg"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of warwick", "affiliation_string": "university of warwick coventry uk", "city": "coventry", "Name": "harald racke"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "massachusetts institute of technology", "city": null, "Name": "tom leighton"}]}, "Article No.: 46": {"references": ["Azar, Y., and Regev, O. 2006.

We note that a similar gap exists in the known results on the integrality gap of the flow-based LP relaxation: an \u03a9(&sqrt;n) lower bound andO(&sqrt;m) upper bound. Motivated by this discrepancy in the upper and lower bounds, we study algorithms for EDP in directed and undirected graphs and obtain improved approximation ratios. We show that the greedy algorithm has an approximation ratio ofO(min(n2/3, &sqrt;m)) in undirected graphs and a ratio ofO(min(n4/5, &sqrt;m)) in directed graphs. For acyclic graphs we give anO(&sqrt;nlnn) approximation via LP rounding. These are the first sublinear approximation ratios for EDP.

Recent experimental results indicated a \u201cdramatic improvement\u201d when full subtrees are replaced by \u201cpartially filled subtrees.\u201d In this article, we provide a theoretical justification of these experimental results, showing, among others, a rather moderate improvement in search time over the original LC tries. For such an analysis, we assume thatnstrings are generated independently by a binary memoryless source, withpdenoting the probability of emitting a \u201c1\u201d (andq&equals; 1 \u2212p). We first prove that the so-called \u03b1-fillup levelFn(\u03b1) (i.e., the largest level in a trie with \u03b1 fraction of nodes present at this level) is concentrated on two values with high probability: eitherFn(\u03b1) &equals;knorFn(\u03b1) &equals;kn&plus; 1, wherekn&equals; log1/&sqrt;pqn\u2212 &verbar;ln (p/q)&verbar;/2 ln3/2(1&sqrt;pq) \u03a6\u22121(\u03b1) &sqrt; lnn&plus;O(1) is an integer and \u03a6(x) denotes the normal distribution function. This result directly yields the typical depth (search time)Dn(\u03b1) in the \u03b1-LC tries, namely, we show that with high probabilityDn(\u03b1) \u223cC2log logn, whereC2&equals; 1/&verbar;log(1 \u2212h/log(1/&sqrt;pq))&verbar; forp\u2260qandh&equals; \u2212plogp\u2212qlogqis the Shannon entropy rate. This should be compared with recently found typical depth in the original LC tries, which isC1log logn, whereC1&equals; 1/&verbar;log(1\u2212h/log(1/min&lcub;p, 1\u2212p&rcub;))&verbar;. In conclusion, we observe that \u03b1 affects only the lower term of the \u03b1-fillup levelFn(\u03b1), and the search time in \u03b1-LC tries is of the same order as in the original LC tries.", "authors": [{"name": "svante janson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100533636"}, {"name": "wojciech szpankowski", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100136191"}], "title": "Partial fillup and search time in LC tries", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "7\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "279\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "sweden", "university": "uppsala university", "affiliation_string": "uppsala university uppsala sweden", "city": "uppsala", "Name": "svante janson"}, {"country": "Cameroon", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "purdue university west lafayette in", "city": "west", "Name": "wojciech szpankowski"}]}, "Article No.: 45": {"references": ["Brander, A., and Sinclair, M. 1995.

Our algorithm is based on areplacement pathsalgorithm proposed by Hershberger and Suri [2001], and can yield a factor \u0398(n) improvement for this problem. But there is a caveat: The fast replacement paths subroutine is known to fail for some directed graphs. However, the failure is easily detected, and so ourkshortest paths algorithm optimistically uses the fast subroutine, then switches to a slower but correct algorithm if a failure is detected. Thus, the algorithm achieves its \u0398(n) speed advantage only when the optimism is justified. Our empirical results show that the replacement paths failure is a rare phenomenon, and the new algorithm outperforms the current best algorithms; the improvement can be substantial in large graphs. For instance, on GIS map data with about 5,000 nodes and 12,000 edges, our algorithm is 4--8 times faster. In synthetic graphs modeling wireless ad hoc networks, our algorithm is about 20 times faster.", "authors": [{"name": "john hershberger", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100630389"}, {"name": "matthew maxel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81341493672"}, {"name": "subhash suri", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332530356"}], "title": "Finding thekshortest simple paths: A new algorithm and its implementation", "citations": [{"Name": "Gang Feng", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xinxin Wang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "K.

The first strategy is that the system can be placed in a sleep state if it is idle. However, a fixed amount of energy is required to bring the system back into an active state in which it can resume work. The second way in which power savings can be achieved is by varying the speed at which jobs are run. We utilize a power consumption curveP(s) which indicates the power consumption level given a particular speed. We assume thatP(s) is convex, nondecreasing, and nonnegative fors\u2265 0. The problem is to schedule arriving jobs in a way that minimizes total energy use and so that each job is completed after its release time and before its deadline. We assume that all jobs can be preempted and resumed at no cost. Although each problem has been considered separately, this is the first theoretical analysis of systems that can use both mechanisms. We give an offline algorithm that is within a factor of 2 of the optimal algorithm.

We propose and study amechanism designapproach in which an allocation mechanism assigns users to resources and charges the users for using the resources so as to induce each user totruthfullyreport a private piece of information he/she holds (e.g., how much traffic he/she needs to transmit). This information is crucial for computing optimal (or close to optimal) allocations and an agent could misreport his/her information to induce the underlying allocation algorithm to output a solution which he/she likes more (e.g., which assigns better resources to him/her).For our resource allocation problems, we give analgorithmic characterizationof the solutions for which truth-telling is a Nash equilibrium. A natural application of these results is to a scheduling/routing problem which is the mechanism design counterpart of the selfish routing game of Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou [1999]: Each selfish user wants to route a piece of unsplittable traffic using one ofmlinks of different speeds so as to minimize his/herownlatency. Our mechanism design counterpart can be seen as the problem of schedulingselfish jobson parallel related machines and is the dual of the problem of scheduling (unselfish) jobs on parallelselfish machinesstudied by Archer and Tardos [2001].Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou studied an \u201canarchic\u201d scenario in which each user chooses his/her own link, and this may produce Nash equilibria of cost \u03a9(logm/log logm) times the optimum. Our mechanism design counterpart is a possible way of reducing the effect of selfish behavior via suitable incentives to the agents (i.e., taxes for using the links). We indeed show that in the resulting game, it is possible to guarantee an approximation factor of 8 for any number of links/machines (this solution also works for online settings). However, it remains impossible to guarantee arbitrarily good approximate solutions, even for 2 links/machines and even if the allocation algorithm is allowed superpolynomial time. This result shows that our scheduling problem with selfish jobs is more difficult than the scheduling problem with selfish machines by Archer and Tardos (which admits exact solutions).We also study some generalizations of this basic problem.", "authors": [{"name": "vincenzo auletta", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100194920"}, {"name": "roberto de prisco", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100201585"}, {"name": "paolo penna", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100438786"}, {"name": "giuseppe persiano", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100328747"}], "title": "Routing selfish unsplittable traffic", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "15\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "376\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universita di salerno salerno italy", "city": "salerno", "Name": "vincenzo auletta"}, {"country": "Italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universita di salerno salerno italy", "city": "salerno", "Name": "roberto de prisco"}, {"country": "Italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universita di salerno salerno italy", "city": "salerno", "Name": "paolo penna"}, {"country": "Italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universita di salerno salerno italy", "city": "salerno", "Name": "giuseppe persiano"}]}, "Article No.: 47": {"references": ["Sanjeev Arora , Carsten Lund, Hardness of approximations, Approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems, PWS Publishing Co., Boston, MA, 1996\n", "J\u00f8rgen Bang-Jensen , St\u00e9phan Thomass\u00e9, Highly connected hypergraphs containing no two edge-disjoint spanning connected subhypergraphs, Discrete Applied Mathematics, v.131 n.2, p.555-559, 12 September 2003[doi>10.1016/S0166-218X(02)00582-6]\n", "Robert Carr , Santosh Vempala, Randomized metarounding, Random Structures & Algorithms, v.20 n.3, p.343-352, May 2002[doi>10.1002/rsa.10033]\n", "Joseph Cheriyan , Mohammad R.

Computing \u03bde(G) is an NP-hard problem. We present approximation algorithms for computing \u03bde(G) in both undirected and directed graphs. In the undirected case we analyze a variant of the modified greedy algorithm suggested by Caprara et al. [2003] and show that it has approximation ratio \u0398(&sqrt;logn), wheren&equals; &verbar;V(G)&verbar;. This improves upon the previousO(logn) upper bound for the approximation ratio of this algorithm. In the directed case we present a &sqrt;n-approximation algorithm. Finally, we give anO(n2/3)-approximation algorithm for the problem of finding a maximum number of edge-disjoint cycles that intersect a specified subsetSof vertices. We also study generalizations of these problems. Our approximation ratios are the currently best-known ones and, in addition, provide upper bounds on theintegrality gapof standard LP-relaxations of these problems. In addition, we give lower bounds for the integrality gap and approximability of \u03bde(G) in directed graphs. Specifically, we prove a lower bound of \u03a9(logn/loglogn) for the integrality gap of edge-disjoint cycle packing. We also show that it is quasi-NP-hard to approximate \u03bde(G) within a factor ofO(log1\u2212 &epsiv;n) for any constant &epsiv; > 0.

While most of the previous work has focused on finding feasible schedules in deadline-based settings, in this article we are interested in schedules that guarantee good response times. More specifically, our goal is to schedule a sequence of jobs on a variable-speed processor so as to minimize the total cost consisting of the energy consumption and the total flow time of all jobs.We first show that when the amount of work, for any job, may take an arbitrary value, then no online algorithm can achieve a constant competitive ratio.

Typically, bandwidth trading involves sellers (e.g., network operators) interested in selling bandwidth pipes that offer to buyers a guaranteed level of service for a specified time interval. The buyers (e.g., bandwidth brokers) are looking to procure bandwidth pipes to satisfy the reservation requests of end-users (e.g., Internet subscribers). Depending on what is available in the bandwidth exchange, the goal of a buyer is to either spend the least amount of money so as to satisfy all the reservations made by its customers, or to maximize its revenue from whatever reservations can be satisfied.We model this as a real-time nonpreemptive scheduling problem in which machine types correspond to bandwidth pipes and jobs correspond to end-user reservation requests. Each job specifies a time interval during which it must be processed, and a set of machine types on which it can be executed. If necessary, multiple machines of a given type may be allocated, but each must be paid for. Finally, each job has associated with it a revenue, which is realized if the job is scheduled on some machine.There are two versions of the problem that we consider. In the cost minimization version, the goal is to minimize the total cost incurred for scheduling all jobs, and in the revenue maximization version the goal is to maximize the revenue of the jobs that are scheduled for processing on a given set of machines. We consider several variants of the problems that arise in practical scenarios, and provide constant factor approximations.", "authors": [{"name": "randeep bhatia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100484258"}, {"name": "julia chuzhoy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100396058"}, {"name": "ari freund", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100166019"}, {"name": "joseph seffi naor", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351600927"}], "title": "Algorithmic aspects of bandwidth trading", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "11\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "589\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Christmas Island", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "bell labs murray hill nj", "city": "murray hill", "Name": "randeep bhatia"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "mit princeton nj", "city": null, "Name": "julia chuzhoy"}, {"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm haifa research lab haifa israel", "city": "haifa", "Name": "ari freund"}, {"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "technion haifa israel", "city": "haifa", "Name": "joseph seffi naor"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Albers, S., and Mitzenmacher, M. 1998.

The motivations for this work are advanced system and architecture designs which allow the operating system to dynamically allocate resources to online protocols such as prefetching and caching. To utilize these features, the operating system needs to identify data streams that can benefit from more resources.Our approach in this work is based on the relation between entropy, compression, and gambling, extensively studied in information theory. It has been shown that in some settings, entropy can either fully or at least partially characterize the expected outcome of an iterative gambling game. Our goal is to study the extent to which the entropy of the input characterizes the expected performance of online algorithms for problems that arise in computer applications. We study bounds based on entropy for three classical online problems---list accessing, prefetching, and caching. Our bounds relate the performance of the best online algorithm to theentropy, a parameter intrinsic to characteristics of the request sequence. This is in contrast to thecompetitive ratioparameter of competitive analysis, which quantifies the performance of the online algorithm with respect to an optimal offline algorithm. For the prefetching problem, we give explicit upper and lower bounds for the performance of the best prefetching algorithm in terms of the entropy of the request sequence. In contrast, we show that the entropy of the request sequence alone does not fully capture the performance of online list accessing and caching algorithms.", "authors": [{"name": "gopal pandurangan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350569331"}, {"name": "eli upfal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339533412"}], "title": "Entropy-based bounds for online algorithms", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "9\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "573\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Cameroon", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "purdue university west lafayette in", "city": "west", "Name": "gopal pandurangan"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "brown university providence ri", "city": "providence", "Name": "eli upfal"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Karl Abrahamson, Generalized string matching, SIAM Journal on Computing, v.16 n.6, p.1039-1051, December 1, 1987[doi>10.1137/0216067]\n", "Stephen Alstrup , Gerth St\u00f8lting Brodal , Theis Rauhe, Pattern matching in dynamic texts, Proceedings of the eleventh annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithms, p.819-828, January 09-11, 2000, San Francisco, California, USA\n", "Amihood Amir , Moshe Lewenstein , Ely Porat, Faster algorithms for string matching withkmismatches, Proceedings of the eleventh annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithms, p.794-803, January 09-11, 2000, San Francisco, California, USA\n", "Anderson, R.

To solve this problem, Nisan and Ronen applied the celebrated Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, which pays a premium to induce the edges so as to reveal their costs truthfully. We observe that this premium can be unacceptably high. There are simple instances where the mechanism pays \u0398(n) times the actual cost of the path, even if there is an alternate path available that costs only (1 &plus; &epsi;) times as much. This inspires thefrugal pathproblem, which is to design a mechanism that selects a path and induces truthful cost revelation, without paying such a high premium.This article contributes negative results on the frugal path problem. On two large classes of graphs, including those having three node-disjoints-tpaths, we prove thatnoreasonable mechanism can always avoid paying a high premium to induce truthtelling. In particular, we introduce a general class ofmin functionmechanisms, and show that all min function mechanisms can be forced to overpay just as badly as VCG. Meanwhile, we prove thateverytruthful mechanism satisfying some reasonable properties is a min function mechanism.Our results generalize to the problem of hiring a team to complete a task, where the analog of a path in the graph is a subset of the agents constituting a team capable of completing the task.", "authors": [{"name": "aaron archer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100201527"}, {"name": "eva tardos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100610119"}], "title": "Frugal path mechanisms", "citations": [{"Name": "Ashwinkumar Badanidiyuru ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Robert Kleinberg ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yaron Singer", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jason D.

The dictionary is stored on disk, where each access to a disk page fetchesBitems, the cost of an operation is the number of pages accessed (I/Os), and efficiency must be attained on entire sequences of string operations rather than on individual ones.Our approach relies on a novel and conceptually simple self-adjusting data structure (SASL) based on skip lists, that is also interestingper se. The search for the whole sequenceT1,T2, \u2026,Tmcan be done in an expected number of I/Os:O(\u2211j&equals;1m&verbar;Tj&verbar;/B&plus; \u2211i&equals;1nn(nilogBm/ni)),where eachTjmay or may not be present in the dictionary, andniis the number of timesSiis queried (i.e., the number ofTjs equal toSi).

We regard this result as thestatic optimality theorem for external-memory string access, as compared to Sleator and Tarjan's classical theorem for numerical dictionaries [Sleator and Tarjan 1985].

In such networks, users may follow selfish strategies to optimize their own performance measure and therefore, their behavior does not have to lead to optimal performance of the entire network. In this article we investigate the worst-case coordination ratio, which is a game-theoretic measure aiming to reflect the price of selfish routing.Following a line of previous work, we focus on the most basic networks consisting of parallel links with linear latency functions. Our main result is that the worst-case coordination ratio onmparallel links of possibly different speeds is\u0398(logm/log log logm).In fact, we are able to give an exact description of the worst-case coordination ratio, depending on the number of links and ratio of speed of the fastest link over the speed of the slowest link. For example, for the special case in which allmparallel links have the same speed, we can prove that the worst-case coordination ratio is \u0393(\u22121)(m) &plus; \u0398(1), with \u0393 denoting the Gamma (factorial) function.

Typically, the output to a database query is a set of tuples that satisfy certain conditions, and, with expensive predicates, these conditions may be computationally costly to verify. In the simplest case, when the query looks for the set of tuples that simultaneously satisfykexpensive predicates, the problem reduces to ordering the evaluation of the predicates so as to minimize the time to output the set of tuples comprising the answer to the query. We study different cases of the problem: thesequential case, in which a single processor is available to evaluate the predicates, and thedistributed case, in which there arekprocessors available, each dedicated to a different attribute (column) of the database, and there is no communication cost between the processors.For the sequential case, we give a simple and fast deterministick-approximation algorithm, and prove thatkis the best possible approximation ratio for a deterministic algorithm, even if exponential time algorithms are allowed. We also propose a randomized, polynomial time algorithm with expected approximation ratio 1 &plus; &sqrt;2/2 &ap; 1.707 fork&equals; 2, and prove that 3/2 is the best possible expected approximation ratio for randomized algorithms. We also show that given 0 \u2264 &epsiv; \u2264 1, no randomized algorithm achieves approximation ratio smaller than 1 &plus; &epsiv; with probability larger than (1 &plus; &epsiv;)/2.For the distributed case, we consider two different models: thepreemptive model, in which a processor is allowed to interrupt the evaluation of a predicate, and thenonpreemptive model, in which the evaluation of a predicate must be completed once started. We show thatkis the best possible approximation ratio for a deterministic algorithm, even if exponential time algorithms are allowed. For the preemptive model, we introduce a polynomial timek-approximation algorithm. For the nonpreemptive model, we introduce a polynomial timeO(klog2k)-approximation algorithm.", "authors": [{"name": "renato carmo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100011224"}, {"name": "tomas feder", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100248357"}, {"name": "yoshiharu kohayakawa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100205623"}, {"name": "eduardo laber", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100181901"}, {"name": "rajeev motwani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100047334"}, {"name": "liadan ocallaghan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452617131"}, {"name": "rina panigrahy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81326491682"}, {"name": "dilys thomas", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100412109"}], "title": "Querying priced information in databases: The conjunctive case", "citations": [{"Name": "Ferdinando Cicalese ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Eduardo Sany Laber", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yurong Jiang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hang Qiu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Matthew McCartney ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "William G.

We demonstrate the power of this approach by suggesting two new P2P architectures and various algorithms for them. The first serves as a DHT (distributed hash table) and the other is a dynamic expander network. The DHT network, which we call Distance Halving, allows logarithmic routing and load while preserving constant degrees. It offers an optimal tradeoff between degree and path length in the sense that degreedguarantees a path length ofO(logdn). Another advantage over previous constructions is its relative simplicity. A major new contribution of this construction is a dynamic caching technique that maintains low load and storage, even under the occurrence of hot spots. Our second construction builds a network that is guaranteed to be an expander. The resulting topologies are simple to maintain and implement. Their simplicity makes it easy to modify and add protocols. A small variation yields a DHT which is robust against random Byzantine faults. Finally we show that, using our approach, it is possible to constructanyfamily of constant degree graphs in a dynamic environment, though with worse parameters. Therefore, we expect that more distributed data structures could be designed and implemented in a dynamic environment.", "authors": [{"name": "moni naor", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100319011"}, {"name": "udi wieder", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100333891"}], "title": "Novel architectures for P2P applications: The continuous-discrete approach", "citations": [{"Name": "Lan Li ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wenjun Xiao", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mourad Amad ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Djamil A\u00efssani ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ahmed Meddahi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Makhlouf Benkerrou ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Farouk Amghar", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "De Bruijn Graph Based Solution for Lookup Acceleration and Optimization in P2P Networks", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sebastian Kniesburges ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andreas Koutsopoulos ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Christian Scheideler", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sebastian Kniesburges ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andreas Koutsopoulos ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Christian Scheideler", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Siddhartha Sen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michael J.

We consider a variety of load balancing models, including identical, restricted, related, and unrelated machines. Our results have a crucial dependence on the weights assigned to jobs. We consider arbitrary weights, integer weights,kdistinct weights, and identical (unit) weights. We look both at an arbitrary schedule (where the only restriction is that a job migrates to a machine which lowers its cost) and specific efficient schedulers (e.g., allowing the largest weight job to move first). A by-product of our results is establishing a connection between various scheduling models and the game-theoretic notion of potential games.

When data is transmitted from its source node to its destination node it may go through other wireless nodes as intermediate hops. The data transmission isnode constrained, that is, every node can transmit data to at most one neighboring node per time step. The transmission rates aretime varyingas a result of changing wireless channel conditions.In this article, we assume that data arrivals and transmission rates are governed by anadversary. The power of the adversary is limited by an admissibility condition which forbids the adversary from overloading any wireless node a priori. The node-constrained transmission and time-varying nature of the transmission rates make our model different from and harder than the standard adversarial queueing model which relates to wireline networks.For the case in which the adversary specifies the paths that the data must follow, we design scheduling algorithms that ensure network stability. These algorithms try to give priority to the data that is closest to its source node. However, at each time step only a subset of the data queued at a node is eligible for scheduling. One of our algorithms is fullydistributed.For the case in which the adversary does not dictate the data paths, we show how to route data so that the admissibility condition is satisfied. We can then schedule data along the chosen paths using our stable scheduling algorithms.", "authors": [{"name": "matthew andrews", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100028731"}, {"name": "lisa zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100121404"}], "title": "Routing and scheduling in multihop wireless networks with time-varying channels", "citations": [{"Name": "Lakshmi Anantharamu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bogdan S.

Each requestfis a node pair with an integer demanddfand a profitwfwhich is obtained if the request is satisfied. The objective is to find a set of demands that can be feasibly routed in the tree and which provides a maximum profit. This generalizes well-known problems, including the knapsack andb-matching problems.When all demands are 1, we have the integer multicommodity flow problem. Garg et al. [1997] had shown that this problem is NP-hard and gave a 2-approximation algorithm for the cardinality case (all profits are 1) via a primal-dual algorithm. Our main result establishes that the integrality gap of the natural linear programming relaxation is at most 4 for the case of arbitrary profits. Our proof is based on coloring paths on trees and this has other applications for wavelength assignment in optical network routing.We then consider the problem with arbitrary demands. When the maximum demanddmaxis at most the minimum edge capacityumin, we show that the integrality gap of the LP is at most 48. This result is obtained by showing that the integrality gap for the demand version of such a problem is at most 11.542 times that for the unit-demand case. We use techniques of Kolliopoulos and Stein [2004, 2001] to obtain this. We also obtain, via this method, improved algorithms for line and ring networks.

It is NP-hard to find a stable matching of maximum size, while any stable matching is a maximal matching and thus trivially we can obtain a 2-approximation algorithm.In this article, we give the first nontrivial result for approximation of factor less than two.

In thewindows schedulingproblem, the goal is to schedule all the items (equal-length information pages) on broadcasting channels such that the gap between two consecutive appearances of pageion any of the channels is at mostwislots (a slot is the transmission time of one page). In theunit-fractions bin packingproblem, the goal is to pack all the items in bins of unit size where the size (width) of itemiis 1/wi. The optimization objective is to minimize the number of channels or bins. In the offline setting, the sequence is known in advance, whereas in the online setting, the items arrive in order and assignment decisions are irrevocable. Since a page requires at least 1/wiof a channel's bandwidth, it follows that windows scheduling without migration (i.e., all broadcasts of a page must be from the same channel) is a restricted version of unit-fractions bin packing.LetH&equals; \u2308\u2211i&equals;1n(1/wi) be the bandwidth lower bound on the required number of bins (channels). The best-known offline algorithm for the windows scheduling problem usedH&plus;O(lnH) channels. This article presents an offline algorithm for the unit-fractions bin packing problem with at mostH&plus; 1 bins. In the online setting, this article presents algorithms for both problems withH&plus;O(&sqrt;H) channels or bins, where the one for the unit-fractions bin packing problem is simpler. On the other hand, this article shows that already for the unit-fractions bin packing problem, any online algorithm must use at leastH&plus;\u03a9(lnH) bins. For instances in which the window sizes form a divisible sequence, an optimal online algorithm is presented.

The new ratio is used to compare online algorithms directly by taking the ratio of their performances on their respective worst permutations of a worst-case sequence.Two variants of the bin packing problem are considered: the classical bin packing problem, where the goal is to fit all items in as few bins as possible, and the dual bin packing problem, which is the problem of maximizing the number of items packed in a fixed number of bins. Several known algorithms are compared using this new measure, and a new, simple variant of first-fit is proposed for dual bin packing.Many of our results are consistent with those previously obtained with the competitive ratio or the competitive ratio on accommodating sequences, but new separations and easier proofs are found.", "authors": [{"name": "joan boyar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100507355"}, {"name": "lene m favrholdt", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100056063"}], "title": "The relative worst order ratio for online algorithms", "citations": [{"Name": "Joan Boyar ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kim S.

We use these techniques to approximate several robust statistics of geometric data streams, including Tukey depth, simplicial depth, regression depth, the Thiel-Sen estimator, and the least median of squares. Our algorithms use only a polylogarithmic amount of memory, provided the desired approximation factors are at least inverse-polylogarithmic.

In order to provision the network, one can eitherrentcapacity on edges at some cost per unit of flow, orbuythem at some larger fixed cost. Bought edges have no incremental, flow-dependent cost. The overall objective is to minimize the total provisioning cost.Recently, Gupta et al. [2003a] presented a 12-approximation for the MROB problem. Their algroithm chooses a subset of the terminal pairs in the graph at random and then buys the edges of an approximate Steiner forest for these pairs. This technique had previously been introduced [Gupta et al. 2003b] for the single-sink rent-or-buy network design problem.In this article we give a 6.828-approximation for the MROB problem by refining the algorithm of Gupta et al. and simplifying their analysis. The improvement in our article is based on a more careful adaptation and simplified analysis of the primal-dual algorithm for the Steiner forest problem due to Agrawal et al. [1995].

This extends previous results on binary sequences, and improves previous results on general sequences where those queries are answered inO(logr) time. For largerr, we can still representSinnH0(S) &plus;o(nlogr) bits and answer queries inO(logr/log logn) time.Another contribution of this article is to show how to combine our compressed representation of integer sequences with a compression boosting technique to designcompressed full-text indexesthat scale well with the size of the input alphabet \u03a3. Specifically, we design a variant of the FM-index that indexes a stringT[1,n] withinnHk(T) &plus;o(n) bits of storage, whereHk(T) is thekth-order empirical entropy ofT. This space bound holds simultaneously for allk\u2264 \u03b1 log&verbar;\u03a3&verbar;n, constant 0 < \u03b1 < 1, and &verbar;\u03a3&verbar; &equals;O(polylog(n)). This index counts the occurrences of an arbitrary patternP[1,p] as a substring ofTinO(p) time; it locates each pattern occurrence inO(log1&plus;&epsiv;n) time for any constant 0 < &epsiv; < 1; and reports a text substring of length &ell; inO(&ell; &plus; log1&plus;&epsiv;n) time.Compared to all previous works, our index is the first that removes the alphabet-size dependance from all query times, in particular, counting time is linear in the pattern length. Still, our index uses essentially the same space of thekth-order entropy of the textT, which is the best space obtained in previous work. We can also handle larger alphabets of size &verbar;\u03a3&verbar; &equals;O(n\u03b2), for any 0 < \u03b2 < 1, by payingo(nlog&verbar;\u03a3&verbar;) extra space and multiplying all query times byO(log &verbar;\u03a3&verbar;/log logn).", "authors": [{"name": "paolo ferragina", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100411624"}, {"name": "giovanni manzini", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100619016"}, {"name": "veli makinen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100185693"}, {"name": "gonzalo navarro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100113887"}], "title": "Compressed representations of sequences and full-text indexes", "citations": [{"Name": "Jesper Jansson ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kunihiko Sadakane ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wing-Kin Sung", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Travis Gagie ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gonzalo Navarro ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Simon J.

We initiate the study of retroactive data structures by formally defining the model and its variants. We prove that, unlike persistence, efficient retroactivity is not always achievable.

The generation of a multiplier block from the set of constants is known as the multiple constant multiplication (MCM) problem. Finding the optimal solution, namely, the one with the fewest number of additions and subtractions, is known to be NP-complete. We propose a new algorithm for the MCM problem, which produces solutions that require up to 20&percnt; less additions and subtractions than the best previously known algorithm. At the same time our algorithm, in contrast to the closest competing algorithm, is not limited by the constant bitwidths. We present our algorithm using a unifying formal framework for the best, graph-based MCM algorithms and provide a detailed runtime analysis and experimental evaluation. We show that our algorithm can handle problem sizes as large as 100 32-bit constants in a time acceptable for most applications. The implementation of the new algorithm is available at www.spiral.net.", "authors": [{"name": "yevgen voronenko", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100647925"}, {"name": "markus puschel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100268784"}], "title": "Multiplierless multiple constant multiplication", "citations": [{"Name": "Rui Guo ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lei Wang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Linda S.

It has long been known that the entropyHof the probability distribution is the dominant term in the lower bound on the average-case search time.

A recent breakthrough on compressed indexing allows us to build an index forTin optimal space (i.e.,O(n) bits), while supporting very efficient pattern matching [Ferragina and Manzini 2000; Grossi and Vitter 2000]. Yet the compressed nature of such indexes also makes them difficult to update dynamically.This article extends the work on optimal-space indexing to a dynamic collection of texts. Our first result is a compressed solution to thelibrary managementproblem, where we show an index ofO(n) bits for a text collectionLof total lengthn, which can be updated inO(&verbar;T&verbar; logn) time when a textTis inserted or deleted fromL; also, the index supports searching the occurrences of any patternPin all texts inLinO(&verbar;P&verbar; logn&plus;occlog2n) time, whereoccis the number of occurrences.Our second result is a compressed solution to thedictionary matchingproblem, where we show an index ofO(d) bits for a pattern collectionDof total lengthd, which can be updated inO(&verbar;P&verbar; log2d) time when a patternPis inserted or deleted fromD; also, the index supports searching the occurrences of all patterns ofDin any textTinO((&verbar;T&verbar; &plus;occ)log2d) time. When compared with theO(dlogd)-bit suffix-tree-based solution of Amir et al. [1995], the compact solution increases the query time by roughly a factor of logdonly.The solution to the dictionary matching problem is based on a new compressed representation of a suffix tree. Precisely, we give anO(n)-bit representation of a suffix tree for a dynamic collection of texts whose total length isn, which supports insertion and deletion of a textTinO(&verbar;T&verbar; log2n) time, as well as all suffix tree traversal operations, including forward and backward suffix links. This work can be regarded as a generalization of the compressed representation of static texts. In the study of the aforementioned result, we also derive the firstO(n)-bit representation for maintainingnpairs of balanced parentheses inO(logn/log logn) time per operation, matching the time complexity of the previousO(nlogn)-bit solution.", "authors": [{"name": "ho-leung chan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435598035"}, {"name": "wing-kai hon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100346108"}, {"name": "tak-wah lam", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100237467"}, {"name": "kunihiko sadakane", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100636624"}], "title": "Compressed indexes for dynamic text collections", "citations": [{"Name": "Arash Farzan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "J.

Optimal stopping theory, especially the classicsecretary problem, is a powerful tool for analyzing such online scenarios which generally require optimizing an objective function over the input. The secretary problem and its generalization themultiple-choice secretary problemwere under a thorough study in the literature. In this article, we consider a very general setting of the latter problem called thesubmodular secretary problem, in which the goal is to selectksecretaries so as to maximize the expectation of a (not necessarily monotone) submodular function which defines efficiency of the selected secretarial group based on their overlapping skills. We present the first constant-competitive algorithm for this case. In a more general setting in which selected secretaries should form an independent (feasible) set in each oflgiven matroids as well, we obtain anO(llog2r)-competitive algorithm generalizing several previous results, whereris the maximum rank of the matroids. Another generalization is to considerlknapsack constraints (i.e., a knapsack constraint assigns a nonnegative cost to each secretary, and requires that the total cost of all the secretaries employed be no more than a budget value) instead of the matroid constraints, for which we present anO(l)-competitive algorithm. In a sharp contrast, we show for a more general setting ofsubadditive secretary problem, there is no\u00f5(\u221an)-competitive algorithm and thus submodular functions are the most general functions to consider for constant-competitiveness in our setting. We complement this result by giving a matchingO(\u221an)-competitive algorithm for the subadditive case.

For example, we can solve similarly restricted generalizations ofBipartization(delete at mostkvertices fromGto make it bipartite) in almost linear time for every fixed numberkof removed vertices. These results answer a number of open questions in the area of parameterized complexity. Furthermore, our technique turns out to be relevant for (H,C,K)- and (H,C,\u2264K)-coloring problems as well, which are cardinality constrained variants of the classicalH-coloring problem.

We study here the combined problem of scheduling and power control, where we seek both an assignment of power settings and a partition of the links so that each set satisfies the signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) constraints.We give an algorithm that attains an approximation ratio ofO(logn&cdot; log log \u0394), wherenis the number of links and \u0394 is the ratio between the longest and the shortest link length. Under the natural assumption that lengths are represented in binary, this gives the first approximation ratio that is polylogarithmic in the size of the input. The algorithm has the desirable property of using an oblivious power assignment, where the power assigned to a sender depends only on the length of the link. We give evidence that this dependence on \u0394 is unavoidable, showing that any reasonably behaving oblivious power assignment results in a \u03a9(log log \u0394)-approximation.These results hold also for the (weighted) capacity problem of finding a maximum (weighted) subset of links that can be scheduled in a single time slot. In addition, we obtain improved approximation for a bidirectional variant of the scheduling problem, give partial answers to questions about the utility of graphs for modeling physical interference, and generalize the setting from the standard 2-dimensional Euclidean plane to doubling metrics. Finally, we explore the utility of graph models in capturing wireless interference.", "authors": [{"name": "magnus m halldorsson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100394927"}], "title": "Wireless scheduling with power control", "citations": [{"Name": "Magn\u00fas M.

Packets arrive at a router at integer time steps, and are buffered upon arrival. Packets have non-negative weights and integer deadlines that are (weakly) increasing in their arrival times. In each integer time step, at most one packet can be sent. The objective is to maximize the sum of the weights of the packets that are sent by their deadlines. The main results include an optimal (\u03c6 := (1 + \u221a 5)/2 &ap; 1.618)-competitive deterministic online algorithm, a (4/3 &ap; 1.33)-competitive randomized online algorithm against an oblivious adversary, and a 2-speed 1-competitive deterministic online algorithm. The analysis does not use a potential function explicitly, but instead modifies the adversary's buffer and credits the adversary to account for these modifications.", "authors": [{"name": "ukasz jez", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81414604594"}, {"name": "fei li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81467651638"}, {"name": "jay sethuraman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100452547"}, {"name": "clifford stein", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332529763"}], "title": "Online scheduling of packets with agreeable deadlines", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "24\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "226\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Czech Republic", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wrocaw poland and academy of sciences of the czech republic pl wroclaw", "city": "czech republic", "Name": "ukasz jez"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "george mason university fairfax va", "city": null, "Name": "fei li"}, {"country": "United Kingdom", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "columbia university new york ny", "city": "york", "Name": "jay sethuraman"}, {"country": "United Kingdom", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "columbia university new york ny", "city": "york", "Name": "clifford stein"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Ittai Abraham , Cyril Gavoille , Andrew V.

The difficulty arises due to the complex signal interactions induced in the network, since the wireless channel inherently broadcasts the signals and there is interference among transmissions. Recently, Avestimehr et al. [2007b] proposed a linear deterministic model that takes into account the shared nature of wireless channels, focusing on the signal interactions rather than the background noise. They generalized the min-cut max-flow theorem for graphs to networks of deterministic channels and proved that the capacity can be achieved using information theoretical tools. They showed that the value of the minimum cut is in this case the minimum rank of all the adjacency matrices describing source-destination cuts.In this article, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm that discovers the relay encoding strategy to achieve the min-cut value in linear deterministic (wireless) networks, for the case of a unicast connection. Our algorithm crucially uses a notion of linear independence between channels to calculate the capacity in polynomial time. Moreover, we can achieve the capacity by using very simple one-symbol processing at the intermediate nodes, thereby constructively yielding finite-length strategies that achieve the unicast capacity of the linear deterministic (wireless) relay network.", "authors": [{"name": "javad b ebrahimi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502781227"}, {"name": "christina fragouli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81338488566"}], "title": "Combinatiorial algorithms for wireless information flow", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "16\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "175\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "epfl lausanne", "city": null, "Name": "javad b ebrahimi"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "epfl lausanne", "city": null, "Name": "christina fragouli"}]}, "Article No.: 3": {"references": ["James Aspnes , Yossi Azar , Amos Fiat , Serge Plotkin , Orli Waarts, On-line load balancing with applications to machine scheduling and virtual circuit routing, Proceedings of the twenty-fifth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing, p.623-631, May 16-18, 1993, San Diego, California, USA[doi>10.1145/167088.167248]\n", "B.

The type of corruption is application-dependent and may be caused by measurements errors, or natural features of the phenomenon. We assume that an appropriate metric exists, which measures the amount of corruption experienced. This article studies the problem of recovering the correct cycle from data corrupted by various error models, formally defined as theperiod recovery problem. Specifically, we define a metric property which we callpseudolocalityand study the period recovery problem under pseudolocal metrics. Examples of pseudolocal metrics are the Hamming distance, the swap distance, and the interchange (or Cayley) distance. We show that for pseudolocal metrics, periodicity is a powerful property allowing detecting the original cycle and correcting the data, under suitable conditions. Some surprising features of our algorithm are that we can efficiently identify the period in the corrupted data, up to a number of possibilities logarithmic in the length of the data string, even for metrics whose calculation isNP-hard. For the Hamming metric, we can reconstruct the corrupted data in near-linear time even for unbounded alphabets. This result is achieved using the property of separation in the self-convolution vector and Reed-Solomon codes. Finally, we employ our techniques beyond the scope of pseudo-local metrics and give a recovery algorithm for the non-pseudolocal Levenshtein edit metric.", "authors": [{"name": "amihood amir", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100506309"}, {"name": "estrella eisenberg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81342493591"}, {"name": "avivit levy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81552074256"}, {"name": "ely porat", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81342507703"}, {"name": "natalie shapira", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81472655070"}], "title": "Cycle detection and correction", "citations": [{"Name": "Amihood Amir ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Estrella Eisenberg ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "A.

This result contrasts with recent results for sporadic task systems. For two special cases, synchronous task systems and systems with a constant number of different task types, we provide the first polynomial-time constant-speedup feasibility tests for multiprocessor platforms. Furthermore, we show that the problem of testing feasibility is coNP-hard for synchronous multiprocessor task systems. The complexity of some of these problems has been open for a long time.We also propose a weight maximization variant of the feasibility problem, where every task has a nonnegative weight, and the goal is to find a subset of tasks that can be scheduled feasibly and has maximum weight.

We present a (partially) persistent data structure that supports predecessor search in a set of integers in {1, ...,U} under an arbitrary sequence ofninsertions and deletions, withO(log logU) expected query time and expected amortized update time, andO(n) space. The query bound is optimal inUfor linear-space structures and improves previous near-O((log logU)2) methods.The same method solves a fundamental problem from computational geometry: point location in orthogonal planar subdivisions (where edges are vertical or horizontal). We obtain the first static data structure achievingO(log logU) worst-case query time and linear space. This result is again optimal inUfor linear-space structures and improves the previousO((log logU)2) method by de Berg et al. [1995]. The same result also holds for higher-dimensional subdivisions that are orthogonal binary space partitions, and for certain nonorthogonal planar subdivisions such as triangulations without small angles. Many geometric applications follow, including improved query times for orthogonal range reporting for dimensions \u2265 3 on the RAM.Our key technique is an interesting new van-Emde-Boas--style recursion that alternates between two strategies, both quite simple.", "authors": [{"name": "timothy m chan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81407593404"}], "title": "Persistent Predecessor Search and Orthogonal Point Location on the Word RAM", "citations": [{"Name": "Sudip Biswas ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Manish Patil ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rahul Shah ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sharma V.

Moreover, it provides an apparent---assuming that PPAD is not contained in TIME(nO(log n))---dichotomy between the complexities of additive and relative approximations, as for constant values of additive approximation a quasi-polynomial-time algorithm is known [Lipton et al. 2003]. Such a dichotomy does not exist for values of the approximation that scale inverse-polynomially with the size of the game, where both relative and additive approximations are PPAD-complete [Chen et al. 2006].

In this article, we show that this bound onkis optimal up to a constant factor, improving upon a previous\u03a9((&epsiv;\u22122log1/\u03b4)/log(1/&epsiv;)) dimension bound of Alon. Our techniques are based on lower bounding the information cost of a novel one-way communication game and yield the first space lower bounds in a data stream model that depend on the error probability\u03b4.For many streaming problems, the most na\u00efve way of achieving error probability\u03b4is to first achieve constant probability, then take the median ofO(log 1/\u03b4) independent repetitions. Our techniques show that for a wide range of problems, this is in fact optimal! As an example, we show that estimating the &ell;p-distance for anyp\u2208\u2009[0,2] requires\u03a9(&epsiv;\u22122lognlog 1/\u03b4) space, even for vectors in {0,1}n.

We also improve previous lower bounds for entropy in the strict turnstile and general turnstile models by a multiplicative factor of\u03a9(log 1/\u03b4).

The famousKarmarkar-Karp algorithmtransforms a fractional solution of a suitable LP relaxation for this problem into an integral solution that requires at mostO(logn) additional bins.Thethree-permutations-problemof Beck is the following. Given any three permutations onnsymbols, color the symbols red and blue, such that in any interval of any of those permutations, the number of red and blue symbols is roughly the same. The necessary difference is called thediscrepancy.We establish a surprising connection between bin packing and Beck\u2019s problem: The additive integrality gap of the 3-partition linear programming relaxation can be bounded by the discrepancy of three permutations.This connection yields an alternative method to establish anO(logn) bound on the additive integrality gap of the 3-partition. Conversely, making use of a recent example of three permutations, for which a discrepancy of \u03a9(logn) is necessary, we prove the following: TheO(log2n) upper bound on the additive gap for bin packing with arbitrary item sizes cannot be improved by any technique that is based on rounding up items.

[1995] showed that for any set ofnpoints in Rd, a (1 +\u03b5)-spanner with diameter at most 2 (respectively, 3) andO(nlogn) edges (respectively,O(nlog logn) edges) can be built inO(nlogn) time. Moreover, it was shown in Arya et al. [1995] and Narasimhan and Smid [2007] that for anyk\u2265 4, one can build inO(n(logn)2k\u03b1k(n)) time a (1 +\u03b5)-spanner with diameter at most 2kandO(n2k\u03b1k(n)) edges. The function\u03b1kis the inverse of a certain function at thek/2 th level of the primitive recursive hierarchy, where\u03b10(n) =n/2 ,\u03b11(n) = \u221an,\u03b12(n) = logn,\u03b13(n) = log logn,\u03b14(n) = log*n,\u03b15(n) = 12 log*n, ..., etc. It is also known [Narasimhan and Smid 2007] that if one allows quadratic time, then these bounds can be improved. Specifically, for anyk\u2265\u20094, a (1\u2009+\u03b5)-spanner with diameter at mostkandO(nk\u03b1k(n)) edges can be constructed inO(n2) time [Narasimhan and Smid 2007].A major open question in this area is whether one can construct within timeO(nlogn+nk\u03b1k(n)) a (1\u2009+\u03b5)-spanner with diameter at mostkandO(nk\u03b1k(n)) edges. In this article, we answer this question in the affirmative. Moreover, in fact, we provide a stronger result. Specifically, we show that for anyk\u2265\u20094, a (1\u2009+\u03b5)-spanner with diameter at mostkandO(n\u03b1k(n)) edges can be built in optimal timeO(nlogn).", "authors": [{"name": "shay solomon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81381599240"}], "title": "Sparse Euclidean Spanners with Tiny Diameter", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "12\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "108\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ben-gurion university", "city": null, "Name": "shay solomon"}]}, "Article No.: 21": {"references": ["Dimitris Achlioptas, Database-friendly random projections: Johnson-Lindenstrauss with binary coins, Journal of Computer and System Sciences, v.66 n.4, p.671-687, 1 June 2003[doi>10.1016/S0022-0000(03)00025-4]\n", "Nir Ailon , Bernard Chazelle, Approximate nearest neighbors and the fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform, Proceedings of the thirty-eighth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing, May 21-23, 2006, Seattle, WA, USA[doi>10.1145/1132516.1132597]\n", "Nir Ailon , Bernard Chazelle, Faster dimension reduction, Communications of the ACM, v.53 n.2, February 2010[doi>10.1145/1646353.1646379]\n", "Nir Ailon , Edo Liberty, Fast Dimension Reduction Using Rademacher Series on\u00a0Dual BCH Codes, Discrete & Computational Geometry, v.42 n.4, p.615-630, October 2009[doi>10.1007/s00454-008-9110-x]\n", "Noga Alon. 2003.

Surprisingly, until now they progressed in parallel and remained mostly separate. Here, we employ new tools from probability in Banach spaces that were successfully used in the context of sparse reconstruction to advance on an open problem in random pojection. In particular, we generalize and use an intricate result by Rudelson and Veshynin [2008] for sparse reconstruction which uses Dudley\u2019s theorem for bounding Gaussian processes. Our main result states that any set ofN= exp(\u00d5(n)) real vectors inndimensional space can be linearly mapped to a space of dimensionk=O(logNpolylog(n)), while (1) preserving the pairwise distances among the vectors to within any constant distortion and (2) being able to apply the transformation in timeO(nlogn) on each vector. This improves on the best known boundN= exp(\u00d5(n1/2)) achieved by Ailon and Liberty [2009] andN= exp(\u00d5(n1/3)) by Ailon and Chazelle [2010]. The dependence in the distortion constant however is suboptimal, and since the publication of an early version of the work, the gap between upper and lower bounds has been considerably tightened obtained by Krahmer and Ward [2011].

Given a weighted undirected graphG= (V,E,w), letCbe a minimum weight cycle ofG, letw(C) be the weight ofC, and letwmax(C) be the weight of the maximum edge ofC. We obtain three new approximation algorithms for the minimum weight cycle problem: (1) for integral weights from the range [1,M], an algorithm that reports a cycle of weight at most 4 3w(C) inO(n2logn(logn+ logM)) time; (2) For integral weights from the range [1,M], an algorithm that reports a cycle of weight at mostw(C) +wmax(C) inO(n2logn(logn+ logM)) time; (3) For nonnegative real edge weights, an algorithm that for any\u03b5> 0 reports a cycle of weight at most (4 3 +\u03b5)w(C) inO(1\u03b5n2logn(log logn)) time.In a recent breakthrough, Williams and Williams [2010] showed that a subcubic algorithm, that computes the exact minimum weight cycle in undirected graphs with integral weights from the range [1,M], implies a subcubic algorithm for computing all-pairs shortest paths in directed graphs with integral weights from the range [\u2212M,M]. This implies that in order to get a subcubic algorithm for computing a minimum weight cycle, we have to relax the problem and to consider an approximated solution. Lingas and Lundell [2009] were the first to consider approximation in the context of minimum weight cycle in weighted graphs. They presented a 2-approximation algorithm for integral weights withO(n2logn(logn+ logM)) running time. They also posed, as an open problem, the question whether it is possible to obtain a subcubic algorithm with ac-approximation, wherec< 2. The current article answers this question in the affirmative, by presenting an algorithm with 4/3-approximation and the same running time. Surprisingly, the approximation factor of 4/3 is not accidental. We show, using the new result of Williams and Williams [2010], that a subcubic combinatorial algorithm with (4/3 \u2212\u03b5)-approximation, where 0 <\u03b5\u2264 1/3, implies a subcubic combinatorial algorithm for multiplying two boolean matrices.", "authors": [{"name": "liam roditty", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100647832"}, {"name": "roei tov", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81496690018"}], "title": "Approximating the Girth", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "11\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "207\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "israel", "university": "bar ilan university", "affiliation_string": "bar ilan university", "city": "ramat gan", "Name": "liam roditty"}, {"country": "israel", "university": "bar ilan university", "affiliation_string": "bar ilan university", "city": "ramat gan", "Name": "roei tov"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Alon, N. and Spencer, J.

In this article, we focus on rendezvous in trees, and, analogously to the efforts that have been made for solving the exploration problem with compact automata, we study the size of memory of mobile agents that permits to solve the rendezvous problem deterministically. We assume that the agents are identical, and move in synchronous rounds.We first show that if the delay between the starting times of the agents isarbitrary, then the lower bound on memory required for rendezvous is\u03a9(logn) bits, even for the line of lengthn. This lower bound meets a previously known upper bound ofO(logn) bits for rendezvous in arbitrary graphs of size at mostn. Our main result is a proof that the amount of memory needed for rendezvouswith simultaneous startdepends essentially on the number &ell; of leaves of the tree, and is exponentially less impacted by the numbernof nodes. Indeed, we present two identical agents withO(log &ell; + log logn) bits of memory that solve the rendezvous problem in all trees with at mostnnodes and at most &ell; leaves. Hence, for the class of trees with polylogarithmically many leaves, there is an exponential gap in minimum memory size needed for rendezvous between the scenario with arbitrary delay and the scenario with delay zero. Moreover, we show that our upper bound is optimal by proving that\u03a9(log &ell; + log logn) bits of memory are required for rendezvous, even in the class of trees with degrees bounded by 3.", "authors": [{"name": "pierre fraigniaud", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100344705"}, {"name": "andrzej pelc", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100014975"}], "title": "Delays Induce an Exponential Memory Gap for Rendezvous in Trees", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "5\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "156\n", "Citation Count": "4\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "France", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cnrs and universite paris diderot", "city": "paris", "Name": "pierre fraigniaud"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "universite du quebec en outaouais", "affiliation_string": "universite du quebec en outaouais", "city": "ottawa", "Name": "andrzej pelc"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2013"}}}, "Volume4": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Article No.: 40": {"references": ["Bernstein, P.

The robot has no a priori knowledge of the topology of the graph, nor of its size. It is known that for anyk-state robot, there exists a graph of maximum degree 3 that the robot cannot explore. This article considers the effects of allowing the system designer to add short labels to the graph nodes in a preprocessing stage, for helping the exploration by the robot. We describe an exploration algorithm that, given appropriate 2-bit labels (in fact, only 3-valued labels), allows a robot to explore all graphs. Furthermore, we describe a suitable labeling algorithm for generating the required labels in linear time. We also show how to modify our labeling scheme so that a robot can explore all graphs of bounded degree, given appropriate 1-bit labels. In other words, although there is no robot able to explore all graphs of maximum degree 3, there is a robot R, and a way to color in black or white the nodes of any bounded-degree graphG, so that R can explore the colored graphG. Finally, we give impossibility results regarding graph exploration by a robot with no internal memory (i.e., a single-state automaton).", "authors": [{"name": "reuven cohen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452616166"}, {"name": "pierre fraigniaud", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100344705"}, {"name": "david ilcinkas", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81311483416"}, {"name": "amos korman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100293239"}, {"name": "david peleg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100569948"}], "title": "Label-guided graph exploration by a finite automaton", "citations": [{"Name": "Amos Korman ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jean-S\u00e9bastien Sereni ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Laurent Viennot", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gianlorenzo D'angelo ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gabriele Di Stefano ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alfredo Navarra ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nicolas Nisse ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Karol Suchan", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "8\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "340\n", "Citation Count": "16\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "boston university boston ma", "city": "boston", "Name": "reuven cohen"}, {"country": "France", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cnrs and universite paris diderot paris france", "city": "paris", "Name": "pierre fraigniaud"}, {"country": "france", "university": "universite bordeaux i", "affiliation_string": "cnrs and universite bordeaux i france", "city": "talence", "Name": "david ilcinkas"}, {"country": "France", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cnrs and universite paris diderot paris france", "city": "paris", "Name": "amos korman"}, {"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the weizmann institute rehovot israel", "city": "rehovot", "Name": "david peleg"}]}, "Article No.: 51": {"references": ["Ageev, A., and Sviridenko, M. 2004.

We give a 2.076-approximation algorithm for this problem using LP rounding, which is currently the best-known performance guarantee. Our algorithm exploits primal and dual complementary slackness conditions and is based onclustered randomized rounding. A technical difficulty that we overcome is the presence of terms with negative coefficients in the dual objective function, which makes it difficult to bound the cost in terms of dual variables. For the case where all requirements are the same, we give a primal-dual 1.52-approximation algorithm.We also consider a fault-tolerant version of thek-median problem. In the metrick-median problem, we are givennpoints in a metric space. We must selectkof these to be centers, and then assign each input pointjto the selected center that is closest to it. In the fault-tolerant version we wantjto be assigned torjdistinct centers. The goal is to select thekcenters so as to minimize the sum of assignment costs. The primal-dual algorithm for fault-tolerant facility location with uniform requirements also yields a 4-approximation algorithm for the fault-tolerantk-median problem for this case.

The problem can be modeled as a special vertex coloring problem for hypergraphs: In every hyperedge there must exist a vertex with a color that occurs exactly once in the hyperedge (the conflict-free property). We concentrate on a special case of the problem, called conflict-free coloring for intervals. We introduce a hierarchy of four models for the aforesaid problem: (i) static, (ii) dynamic offline, (iii) dynamic online with absolute positions, and (iv) dynamic online with relative positions. In the dynamic offline model, we give a deterministic algorithm that uses at most log3/2n+ 1 &;approx; 1.71 log2ncolors and show inputs that force any algorithm to use at least 3 log5n+ 1 &approx; 1.29 log2ncolors. For the online absolute-positions model, we give a deterministic algorithm that uses at most 3\u2308log3n\u2309 &approx; 1.89 log2ncolors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deterministic online algorithm usingO(logn) colors in a nontrivial online model. In the online relative-positions model, we resolve an open problem by showing a tight analysis on the number of colors used by the first-fit greedy online algorithm. We also consider conflict-free coloring only with respect to intervals that contain at least one of the two extreme points.", "authors": [{"name": "amotz bar-noy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100242368"}, {"name": "panagiotis cheilaris", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81316487504"}, {"name": "shakhar smorodinsky", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100306841"}], "title": "Deterministic conflict-free coloring for intervals: From offline to online", "citations": [{"Name": "A.

The notion of embedding is, given two metric spaces on the same number of points, to find a bijection that minimizes maximum Lipschitz and bi-Lipschitz constants. One reason for the popularity of the notion is that algorithms designed for one metric space can be applied to a different one, given an embedding with small distortion. The better distortion, the better the effectiveness of the original algorithm applied to a new metric space.The goal recently studied by Kenyon et al. [2004] is to consider all possible embeddings between twofinitemetric spaces and to find the best possible one; that is, consider a single objective function over the space of all possible embeddings that minimizes the distortion. In this article we continue this important direction. In particular, using a theorem of Albert and Atkinson [2005], we are able to provide an algorithm to find the optimal bijection between two line metrics, provided that the optimal distortion is smaller than 13.602. This improves the previous bound of 3 + 2&sqrt;2, solving an open question posed by Kenyon et al. [2004]. Further, we show an inherent limitation of algorithms using the \u201cforbidden pattern\u201d based dynamic programming approach, in that they cannot find optimal mapping if the optimal distortion is more than 7 + 4&sqrt;3 (&sime; 13.928). Thus, our results are almost optimal for this method. We also show that previous techniques for general embeddings apply to a (slightly) more general class of metrics.", "authors": [{"name": "nishanth chandran", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367596784"}, {"name": "ryan moriarty", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384615354"}, {"name": "rafail ostrovsky", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100593806"}, {"name": "omkant pandey", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319498871"}, {"name": "mohammad ali safari", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100537109"}, {"name": "amit sahai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100132310"}], "title": "Improved algorithms for optimal embeddings", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "12\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "285\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Trinidad and Tobago", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california los angeles ca", "city": "california", "Name": "nishanth chandran"}, {"country": "Trinidad and Tobago", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california los angeles ca", "city": "california", "Name": "ryan moriarty"}, {"country": "Trinidad and Tobago", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california los angeles ca", "city": "california", "Name": "rafail ostrovsky"}, {"country": "Trinidad and Tobago", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california los angeles ca", "city": "california", "Name": "omkant pandey"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of alberta", "affiliation_string": "university of alberta alberta canada", "city": "edmonton", "Name": "mohammad ali safari"}, {"country": "Trinidad and Tobago", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california los angeles ca", "city": "california", "Name": "amit sahai"}]}, "Article No.: 41": {"references": ["Yehuda Afek , Baruch Awerbuch , Serge Plotkin , Michael Saks, Local management of a global resource in a communication network, Journal of the ACM (JACM), v.43 n.1, p.1-19, Jan. 1996[doi>10.1145/227595.227596]\n", "Y.

The work focuses on dynamic weighted general graphs where the vertices of the graph are fixed, but the weights of the edges may change. Our main contribution concerns bounding the cost of adapting to dynamic changes. The update efficiency of a routing scheme is measured by the time needed in order to update the routing scheme following a weight change. A naive dynamic routing scheme, which updates all vertices following a weight change, requires \u03a9(Diam) time in order to perform the updates after every weight change, whereDiamis the diameter of the underlying graph. In contrast, this article presents approximate dynamic routing schemes with average time complexity \u0398\u02dc(D) per topological change, whereDis the local density parameter of the underlying graph.

For example, there exists a potential function proving the existence of pure Nash equilibria (PNE) in the unrelated parallel links setting; in the network setting, the finite improvement property collapses as soon as we depart from linear delays, but there is an exact potential (and thus PNE) for linear delays. The price of anarchy on identical parallel links demonstrates a quite surprising threshold behavior: It persists on being asymptotically equal to that in the case of the noncooperative KP-model, unless the number of coalitions issublogarithmic.We also show crucial differences, mainly concerning the hardness of algorithmic problems that are solved efficiently in the noncooperative case. Although we demonstrate convergence to robust PNE, we also prove the hardness of computing them. On the other hand, we propose a generalized fully mixed Nash equilibrium that can be efficiently constructed in most cases. Finally, we propose a natural improvement policy and prove its convergence in pseudopolynomial time to PNE which are robust against (even dynamically forming) coalitions of small size.", "authors": [{"name": "dimitris fotakis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100073283"}, {"name": "spyros kontogiannis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100495652"}, {"name": "paul spirakis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100455984"}], "title": "Atomic congestion games among coalitions", "citations": [{"Name": "Kshipra Bhawalkar ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Martin Gairing ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tim Roughgarden", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "12\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "338\n", "Citation Count": "7\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Greece", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of the aegean samos greece", "city": "samos", "Name": "dimitris fotakis"}, {"country": "greece", "university": "university of ioannina", "affiliation_string": "university of ioannina ioannina greece", "city": "ioannina", "Name": "spyros kontogiannis"}, {"country": "greece", "university": "university of patras", "affiliation_string": "university of patras rio-patra greece", "city": "patrai", "Name": "paul spirakis"}]}, "Article No.: 47": {"references": ["Ravindra K.

The nature of wireless transmissions does not lead to arbitrary undirected graphs but to structured graphs which we characterize by the polynomially bounded growth property. In contrast to many existing graph models for wireless networks, the property of polynomially bounded growth is defined independently of geometric data such as positional information.On such wireless networks, we present an approach that can be used to create polynomial-time approximation schemes for several optimization problems called the local neighborhood-based scheme. We apply this approach to the problems of seeking maximum (weight) independent sets and minimum dominating sets. These are two important problems in the area of wireless communication networks and are also used in many applications ranging from clustering to routing strategies. However, the approach is presented in a general fashion since it can be applied to other problems as well.The approach for the approximation schemes is robust in the sense that it accepts any undirected graph as input and either outputs a solution of desired quality or correctly asserts that the graph presented as input does not satisfy the structural assumption of a wireless network (an NP-hard problem).", "authors": [{"name": "tim nieberg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100200421"}, {"name": "johann hurink", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409594797"}, {"name": "walter kern", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100599135"}], "title": "Approximation schemes for wireless networks", "citations": [{"Name": "Imran A.

We are given a set of demands to be carried over a network. Our goal is to choose a route for each demand and to decompose the network into a collection of edge-disjoint simple paths. These paths are calledoptical line systems. The cost of routing one unit of demand is the number of line systems with which the demand route overlaps; our design objective is to minimize the total cost over all demands. This cost metric is motivated by the need to minimize O-E-O (optical-electrical-optical) conversions in optical transmission.For given line systems, it is easy to find the optimal demand routes. On the other hand, for given demand routes designing the optimal line systems can be NP-hard. We first present a 2-approximation for general network topologies. As optical networks often have low node degrees, we offer an algorithm that finds the optimal solution for the special case in which the node degree is at most 3. Our solution is based on a local greedy approach.If neither demand routes nor line systems are fixed, the situation becomes much harder. Even for a restricted scenario on a 3-regular Hamiltonian network, no efficient algorithm can guarantee a constant approximation better than 2. For general topologies, we offer a simple algorithm with anO(logK)- and anO(logn)-approximation, whereKis the number of demands andnthe number of nodes. This approximation ratio is almost tight. For rings, a common special topology, we offer a more complex 3/2-approximation algorithm.", "authors": [{"name": "elliot anshelevich", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100063387"}, {"name": "lisa zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100121404"}], "title": "Path decomposition under a new cost measure with applications to optical network design", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "11\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "334\n", "Citation Count": "4\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Jamaica", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "rensselaer polytechnic institute troy ny", "city": "troy", "Name": "elliot anshelevich"}, {"country": "Christmas Island", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "bell laboratories murray hill nj", "city": "murray hill", "Name": "lisa zhang"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Pankaj K.

In computer science, order is intimately related to sorting, commonly meant as the task of arranging keys in increasing or decreasing order with respect to an underlying total order relation. The sorted organization is amenable for searching a set ofnkeys, since each search requires \u0398(logn) comparisons in the worst case, which is optimal if the cost of a single comparison can be considered a constant. Nevertheless, we prove that disorder implicitly provides more information than order does. For the general case of searching an array of multidimensional keys whose comparison cost is proportional to their length (and hence which cannot be considered a constant), we demonstrate that \u201csuitable\u201d disorder gives better bounds than those derivable by using the natural lexicographic order.We start from previous work done by Andersson et al. [2001], who proved that \u0398(klog logn/log log(4 &plus;klog logn/logn) &plus;k&plus; logn) character comparisons (or probes) comprise the tight complexity for searching a plain sorted array ofnkeys, each of lengthk, arranged in lexicographic order. We describe a novelpermutationof thenkeys that is different from the sorted order. When keys are kept \u201cunsorted\u201d in the array according to this permutation, the complexity of searching drops to \u0398(k&plus; logn) character comparisons (or probes) in the worst case, which isoptimalamong all possible permutations, up to a constant factor. Consequently, disorder carries more information than does order; this fact was not observable before, since the latter two bounds are \u0398(logn) whenk&equals;O(1).

Among these are the minimum spanning tree (MST) problem, the MST sensitivity analysis problem, the parallel connected components and parallel minimum spanning tree problems, and the local sorting and set maxima problems. (For the first two problems there are provably optimal deterministic algorithms with unknown, and possibly superlinear, running times.) One downside of the randomized methods for solving these problems is that they use a number of random bits linear in the size of input. In this article we develop some general methods for reducing exponentially the consumption of random bits in comparison-based algorithms. In some cases we are able to reduce the number of random bits from linear to nearly constant, without affecting the expected running time.Most of our results are obtained by adjusting or reorganizing existing randomized algorithms to work well with a pairwise orO(1)-wise independent sampler. The prominent exception, and the main focus of this article, is a linear-time randomized minimum spanning tree algorithm that isnotderived from the well-known Karger-Klein-Tarjan algorithm. In many ways it resembles more closely the deterministic minimum spanning tree algorithms based on soft heaps. Further, using our algorithm as a guide, we present a unified view of the existing \u201cnongreedy\u201d minimum spanning tree algorithms. Concepts from the Karger-Klein-Tarjan algorithm, such asF-lightness, MST verification, and sampled graphs, are related to the concepts of edge corruption, subgraph contractibility, and soft heaps, which are the basis of the deterministic MST algorithms of Chazelle and Pettie-Ramachandran.", "authors": [{"name": "seth pettie", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339521982"}, {"name": "vijaya ramachandran", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100155104"}], "title": "Randomized minimum spanning tree algorithms using exponentially fewer random bits", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "12\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "772\n", "Citation Count": "5\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of michigan ann arbor mi", "city": "michigan", "Name": "seth pettie"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of texas at austin austin tx", "city": "austin", "Name": "vijaya ramachandran"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Noga Alon , Yossi Matias , Mario Szegedy, The space complexity of approximating the frequency moments, Proceedings of the twenty-eighth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing, p.20-29, May 22-24, 1996, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA[doi>10.1145/237814.237823]\n", "S.

In this analysis we prove that there is a deterministic algorithm asymptotically performing as well as any randomized algorithm in the comparison model. We define theredundancy analysis, based on a measure of the internal redundancy of the instance. In this analysis we prove that any algorithm optimal in the redundancy analysis is optimal in the alternation analysis, but that there is a randomized algorithm which performs strictly better than any deterministic algorithm in the comparison model.

The main motivation is realization of deterministic dictionaries with fast lookups and reasonably fast updates.

Many of the modern solutions to the dictionary problem are weakly nonuniform, that is, they require a number of constants to be computed at \u201ccompile time\u201d for the stated time bounds to hold. The currently fastest deterministic dictionary uses constants not known to be computable in polynomial time. In contrast, our dictionaries do not require any special constants or instructions, and running times are independent of word (and key) length.

Given this implicit representation, the approximate value of the concurrent flow is known, but if we want the explicit flow per commodity per edge, we would have to combine all these trees together, and the cost of doing so may be prohibitive.

Using this technique, we improve the best-known results for scheduling conflicting jobs with the min-sum objective, on several fundamental classes of graphs, including line graphs, (k&plus; 1)-claw-free graphs, and perfect graphs. In particular, we obtain the first constant-factor approximation ratio for nonpreemptive scheduling on interval graphs.

This article considers an abstraction of this problem calledWrite-All: using p processors write 1's into all locations of an array of size n. In this problem writing 1 abstracts the notion of performing a simple task. Despite substantial research, there is a dearth of efficient deterministic asynchronous algorithms forWrite-All/. Efficiency of algorithms is measured in terms ofworkthat accounts for all local steps performed by the processors in solving the problem. Thus, an optimal algorithm would have work \u0398(n), however it is known that optimality cannot be achieved whenp&equals; \u03a9(n). The quest then is to obtain work-optimal solutions for this problem using a nontrivial, compared ton, number of processorsp. The algorithm presented in this article has work complexity ofO(n+p2 + &epsi;), and it achieves work optimality forp&equals;O(n1/(2 + &epsiv;)) for any &epsiv; > 0, while the previous best result achieved optimality forp\u22644&sqrt;n/logn.

In this article, we study the capacitated version of this problem in which the input includes an integral capacity for each line. The capacity of a line bounds the number of rectangles that the line can cover. We consider two versions of this problem. In the first, one is allowed to use only a single copy of each line (hard capacities), and in the second, one is allowed to use multiple copies of every line, but the multiplicities are counted in the size (or weight) of the solution (soft capacities).We present an exact polynomial-time algorithm for the weighted one dimensional case with hard capacities that can be extended to the one dimensional weighted case with soft capacities. This algorithm is also extended to solve a certain capacitated multi-itemlot-sizinginventory problem with joint set-up costs. For the case ofd-dimensional rectangle stabbing with soft capacities, we present a 3d-approximation algorithm for the unweighted case. Ford-dimensional rectangle stabbing problem with hard capacities, we present a bi-criteria algorithm that computes 4d-approximate solutions that use at most two copies of every line.

Given a sequence ofnk-bit numbers, we present a structure takingkn+o(kn) bits of space, able of performing operationssum,search,insert, anddelete, all inO(logn) worst-case time, for anyk&equals;O(logn). This extends previous results by Hon et al. [2003c] achieving the same space andO(logn/log logn) time complexities for the queries, yet offering complexities forinsertanddeletethat are amortized and worse than ours, and supported only fork&equals;O(1). Our result matches an existing lower bound for large values ofk.We also give new solutions to the Dynamic Sequence problem. Given a sequence ofnsymbols in the range [1,\u03c3] with binary zero-order entropyH0, we present a dynamic data structure that requiresnH0+o(nlog \u03c3) bits of space, which is able of performingrankandselect, as well as inserting and deleting symbols at arbitrary positions, inO(lognlog \u03c3) time. Our result is thefirstentropy-bound dynamic data structure forrankandselectover general sequences.In the case \u03c3 &equals; 2, where both previous problems coincide, we improve the dynamic solution of Hon et al. [2003c] in that we compress the sequence. The only previous result with entropy-bound space for dynamic binary sequences is by Blandford and Blelloch [2004], which has the same complexities as our structure, but does not achieve constant 1 multiplying the entropy term in the space complexity.Finally, we present a new dynamic compressed full-text self-index, for a collection of texts over an alphabet of size \u03c3, of overall lengthnandhth order empirical entropyHh. The index requiresnHh+o(nlog \u03c3) bits of space, for anyh\u2264 \u03b1 logsigmanand constant 0 < \u03b1 < 1. It can count the number of occurrences of a pattern of lengthmin timeO(mlognlog \u03c3). Each such occurrence can be reported inO(log2nlog logn) time, and displaying a context of length &ell; from a text takes timeO(logn(&ell; log \u03c3 + lognlog logn)). Insertion/deletion of a text to/from the collection takesO(lognlog \u03c3) time per symbol. This significantly improves the space of a previous result by Chan et al. [2004] in exchange for a slight time complexity penalty. We achieve at the same time thefirstdynamic index requiring essentiallynHhbits of space, and thefirstconstruction of a compressed full-text self-index within that working space. Previous results achieve at bestO(nHhspace with constants larger than 1 [Ferragina and Manzini 2000; Arroyuelo and Navarro 2005] and higher time complexities.An important result we prove in this paper is that the wavelet tree of the Burrows-Wheeler transform of a text, if compressed with a technique that achieves zero-order compression locally (e.g., Raman et al. [2002]), automatically achieveshth order entropy space for anyh. This unforeseen relation is essential for the results of the previous paragraph, but it also derives into significant simplifications on many existing static compressed full-text self-indexes that build on wavelet trees.", "authors": [{"name": "veli makinen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100185693"}, {"name": "gonzalo navarro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100113887"}], "title": "Dynamic entropy-compressed sequences and full-text indexes", "citations": [{"Name": "M.

Our bijection yields an efficient uniform random sampler for 3-connected planar graphs, which turns out to be determinant for the quadratic complexity of the current best-known uniform random sampler for labelled planar graphs. It also provides an encoding for the setP(n) ofn-edge 3-connected planar graphs that matches the entropy bound 1/nlog2&verbar;P(n)&verbar; &equals; 2 &plus;o(1) bits per edge (bpe). This solves a theoretical problem recently raised in mesh compression as these graphs abstract the combinatorial part of meshes with spherical topology. We also achieve the optimal parametric rate 1/nlog2&verbar;P(n,i,j)&verbar; bpe for graphs ofP(n) withivertices andjfaces, matching in particular the optimal rate for triangulations. Our encoding relies on a linear time algorithm to compute an orientation associated with the minimal Schnyder wood of a 3-connected planar map. This algorithm is of independent interest, and it is, for instance, a key ingredient in a recent straight line drawing algorithm for 3-connected planar graphs.", "authors": [{"name": "eric fusy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100508776"}, {"name": "gilles schaeffer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100088530"}, {"name": "dominique poulalhon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100477183"}], "title": "Dissections, orientations, and trees with applications to optimal mesh encoding and random sampling", "citations": [{"Name": "Olivier Bernardi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mireille Bousquet-M\u00e9lou", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "9\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "322\n", "Citation Count": "7\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "france", "university": "ecole polytechnique", "affiliation_string": "lix ecole polytechnique france", "city": "palaiseau", "Name": "eric fusy"}, {"country": "france", "university": "ecole polytechnique", "affiliation_string": "lix ecole polytechnique france", "city": "palaiseau", "Name": "gilles schaeffer"}, {"country": "France", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "liafa universite paris 7 france", "city": "paris", "Name": "dominique poulalhon"}]}, "Article No.: 23": {"references": ["Matthew Andrews, Hardness of Buy-at-Bulk Network Design, Proceedings of the 45th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, p.115-124, October 17-19, 2004[doi>10.1109/FOCS.2004.32]\n", "Andrews, M., and Zhang, L. 2002.

Each terminaltisendsdiunits of traffic and enough bandwidth has to be allocated on the edges to permit this. However, bandwidth on an edgeecan only be allocated inintegralmultiples of some base capacityueand hence provisioningk\u00d7uebandwidth on edgeeincurs a cost of \u2308k\u2309 times the cost of that edge. The objective is a minimum-cost feasible solution.This is one of many network design problems widely studied where the bandwidth allocation is governed by side constraints: edges can only allow a subset of cables to be purchased on them or certain quality-of-service requirements may have to be met.In this work, we show that this problem and, in fact, several basic problems in this general network design framework cannot be approximated better than \u03a9(log logn) unless NP \u2286 DTIME (nO(log log logn)), where &verbar;V&verbar; &equals;n. In particular, we show that this inapproximability threshold holds for (i) the Priority-Steiner Tree problem, (ii) the (single-sink) Cost-Distance problem, and (iii) the single-sink version of an even more fundamental problem, Fixed Charge Network Flow. Our results provide a further breakthrough in the understanding of the level of complexity of network design problems.

A cost-sharing scheme is cross-monotonic if it satisfies the property that everyone is better off when the set of people who receive the service expands. In this article, we develop a novel technique for proving upper bounds on thebudget-balance factorof cross-monotonic cost-sharing schemes or the worst-case ratio of recovered cost to total cost. We apply this technique to games defined, based on several combinatorial optimization problems, including the problems of edge cover, vertex cover, set cover, and metric facility location and, in each case, derive tight or nearly-tight bounds. In particular, we show that for the facility location game, there is no cross-monotonic cost-sharing scheme that recovers more than a third of the total cost. This result, together with a recent 1/3-budget-balanced cross-monotonic cost-sharing scheme of P\u00e1l and Tardos &lsqb;2003&rsqb; closes the gap for the facility location game. For the vertex cover and set cover games, we show that no cross-monotonic cost-sharing scheme can recover more than aO(n\u22121/3) andO(1/n) fraction of the total cost, respectively. Finally, we study the implications of our results on the existence of group-strategyproof mechanisms. We show that every group-strategyproof mechanism corresponds to a cost-sharing scheme that satisfies a condition weaker than cross-monotonicity. Using this, we prove that group-strategyproof mechanisms satisfying additional properties give rise to cross-monotonic cost-sharing schemes and therefore our upper bounds hold.", "authors": [{"name": "nicole immorlica", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100026909"}, {"name": "mohammad mahdian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100332135"}, {"name": "vahab s mirrokni", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100335721"}], "title": "Limitations of cross-monotonic cost-sharing schemes", "citations": [{"Name": "Emmanouil Pountourakis ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Angelina Vidali", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "A complete characterization of group-strategyproof mechanisms of cost-sharing", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Georgios Piliouras ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tom\u00e1\u0161 Valla ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 A.

For a given graphG, a vertex subsetSof sizek(and also its induced subgraphG(S)) is said to bec-isolated ifG(S) is connected to its outside via less thanckedges. The numbercis sometimes called theisolation factor. The subgraph appears more isolated if the isolation factor is smaller. The main result in this work shows that for a fixed constantc, we can enumerate allc-isolated maximal cliques (including a maximum one, if any) in linear time.In more detail, we show that, for a given graphGofnvertices andmedges, and a positive real numberc, allc-isolated maximal cliques can be enumerated in timeO( c422cm). From this, we can see that: (1) ifcis a constant, allc-isolated maximal cliques can be enumerated in linear time, and (2) ifc&equlas;O(logn), allc-isolated maximal cliques can be enumerated in polynomial time. Moreover, we show that these bounds are tight. That is, iff(n) is an increasing function not bounded by any constant, then there is a graph ofnvertices andmedges for which the number off(n)-isolated maximal cliques is superlinear inn+m. Furthermore, iff(n) &equals; \u03c9(logn), there is a graph ofnvertices andmedges for which the number off(n)-isolated maximal cliques is superpolynomial inn+m.We next introduce the idea of pseudo-cliques. Apseudo-cliquehaving an average degree \u03b1 and a minimum degree \u03b2, denoted byPC(\u03b1,\u03b2), is a setV\u2032 \u2286Vsuch that the subgraph induced byV\u2032 has an average degree of at least \u03b1 and a minimum degree of at least \u03b2. This article investigates these, and obtains some cases that can be solved in polynomial time and some other cases that have a superpolynomial number of solutions. Especially, we show the following results, wherekis the number of vertices of the isolated pseudo-cliques: (1) For any &epsiv; > 0 there is a graph ofnvertices for which the number of 1-isolatedPC(k\u2212 (logk)1 + &epsiv;,k/(logk)1 + &epsiv;) is superpolynomial, and (2) there is a polynomial-time algorithm which enumerates allc-isolatedPC(k\u2212 logk,k/logk), for any constantc.", "authors": [{"name": "hiro ito", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100600238"}, {"name": "kazuo iwama", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100225415"}], "title": "Enumeration of isolated cliques and pseudo-cliques", "citations": [{"Name": "Falk H\u00fcffner ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Christian Komusiewicz ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hannes Moser ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rolf Niedermeier", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "21\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "302\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "japan", "university": "kyoto university", "affiliation_string": "kyoto university kyoto japan", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "hiro ito"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "kyoto university", "affiliation_string": "kyoto university kyoto japan", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "kazuo iwama"}]}, "Article No.: 42": {"references": ["Mikhail J Atallah, Computing the convex hull of line intersections, Journal of Algorithms, v.7 n.2, p.285-288, June 1986[doi>10.1016/0196-6774(86)90010-6]\n", "Berend, D. and Braverman, V. 2005.

Most of the interesting algorithmic problems related to lattice reduction are NP-hard as the lattice dimension increases. This article deals with the low-dimensional case. We study a greedy lattice basis reduction algorithm for the Euclidean norm, which is arguably the most natural lattice basis reduction algorithm because it is a straightforward generalization of an old two-dimensional algorithm of Lagrange, usually known as Gauss' algorithm, and which is very similar to Euclid's gcd algorithm. Our results are twofold. From a mathematical point of view, we show that up to dimension four, the output of the greedy algorithm is optimal: The output basis reaches all the successive minima of the lattice. However, as soon as the lattice dimension is strictly higher than four, the output basis may be arbitrarily bad as it may not even reach the first minimum. More importantly, from a computational point of view, we show that up to dimension four, the bit-complexity of the greedy algorithm is quadratic without fast integer arithmetic, just like Euclid's gcd algorithm. This was already proved by Semaev up to dimension three using rather technical means, but it was previously unknown whether or not the algorithm was still polynomial in dimension four. We propose two different analyzes: a global approach based on the geometry of the current basis when the length decrease stalls, and a local approach showing directly that a significant length decrease must occur everyO(1) consecutive steps. Our analyzes simplify Semaev's analysis in dimensions two and three, and unify the cases of dimensions two to four. Although the global approach is much simpler, we also present the local approach because it gives further information on the behavior of the algorithm.", "authors": [{"name": "phong q nguyen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100511447"}, {"name": "damien stehle", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81485658852"}], "title": "Low-dimensional lattice basis reduction revisited", "citations": [{"Name": "Martin R.

Once deployed, they must wake up and form a radio network. Sensor network bootstrapping research thus has three parts: One must model the restrictions on sensor nodes; one must prove that the connectivity graph of the sensors has a subgraph that would make a good network; and one must give a distributed protocol for finding such a network subgraph that can be implemented on sensor nodes.Although many particular restrictions on sensor nodes are implicit or explicit in many papers, there remain many inconsistencies and ambiguities from paper to paper. The lack of a clear model means that solutions to the network bootstrapping problem in both the theory and systems literature all violate constraints on sensor nodes. For example, random geometric graph results on sensor networks predict the existence of subgraphs on the connectivity graph with good route-stretch, but these results do not address the degree of such a graph, and sensor networks must have constant degree. Furthermore, proposed protocols for actually finding such graphs require that nodes have too much memory, whereas others assume the existence of a contention-resolution mechanism.We present a formal Weak Sensor model that summarizes the literature on sensor node restrictions, taking the most restrictive choices when possible. We show that sensor connectivity graphs have low-degree subgraphs with goodhop-stretch, as required by the Weak Sensor model. Finally, we give a Weak Sensor model-compatible protocol for finding such graphs.

Where the usual CSPs from computer science and optimization have real-valued score functions, and partition functions from physics have monomials, PCSP has scores that are arbitrary multivariate formal polynomials, or indeed take values in an arbitrary ring.Although PCSP is much more general than CSP, remarkably, all (exact, exponential-time) algorithms we know of for 2-CSP (where each score depends on at most 2 variables) extend to 2-PCSP, at the expense of just a polynomial factor in running time. Specifically, we extend the reduction-based algorithm of Scott and Sorkin [2007]; the specialization of that approach to sparse random instances, where the algorithm runs in polynomial expected time; dynamic-programming algorithms based on tree decompositions; and the split-and-list matrix-multiplication algorithm of Williams [2004].This gives the first polynomial-space exact algorithm more efficient than exhaustive enumeration for the well-studied problems of finding a maximum bisection of a graph, and calculating the partition function of an Ising model. It also yields the most efficient algorithm known for certain instances of counting and/or weighted Maximum Independent Set. Furthermore, PCSP solves both optimization and counting versions of a wide range of problems, including all CSPs, and thus enables samplers including uniform sampling of optimal solutions and Gibbs sampling of all solutions.", "authors": [{"name": "alexander d scott", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100544576"}, {"name": "gregory b sorkin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100287385"}], "title": "Polynomial constraint satisfaction problems, graph bisection, and the Ising partition function", "citations": [{"Name": "Keith J.

For distributions, natural measures are not &ell;pdistances, but information-theoretic measures such as the Kullback-Leibler and Hellinger divergences. Similarly, quantities such as the entropy of a distribution are more natural than frequency moments. Efficient estimation of these quantities is a key component in algorithms for manipulating distributions. Since the datasets involved are typically massive, these algorithms need to have only sublinear complexity in order to be feasible in practice.We present a range of sublinear-time algorithms in various oracle models in which the algorithm accesses the data via an oracle that supports various queries. In particular, we answer a question posed by Batu et al. on testing whether two distributions are close in an information-theoretic sense given independent samples. We then present optimal algorithms for estimating various information-divergences and entropy with a more powerful oracle called the combined oracle that was also considered by Batu et al. Finally, we consider sublinear-space algorithms for these quantities in the data-stream model. In the course of doing so, we explore the relationship between the aforementioned oracle models and the data-stream model. This continues work initiated by Feigenbaum et al. An important additional component to the study is considering data streams that are ordered randomly rather than just those which are ordered adversarially.", "authors": [{"name": "sudipto guha", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331493787"}, {"name": "andrew mcgregor", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100422581"}, {"name": "suresh venkatasubramanian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100359638"}], "title": "Sublinear estimation of entropy and information distances", "citations": [{"Name": "Ronitt Rubinfeld", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Taming big probability distributions", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tu\u011fkan Batu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lance Fortnow ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ronitt Rubinfeld ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Warren D.

This article proposes a natural optimization formulation of the DNA code design problem in which the goal is to designnstrings that satisfy a given set of constraints while minimizing the length of the strings. For multiple sets of constraints, we provide simple randomized algorithms that run in time polynomial innand any given constraint parameters, and output strings of length within a constant factor of the optimal with high probability.

Whether there is aO(n+m)-time algorithm for this theorem was left as an open problem. In this article, we obtain aO(n+m)-time algorithm at the expense of aO(n2/3) separator.

In particular, for any given &epsi; \u2208 [0,1/2], our algorithm outputs either aK&ell;-minor ofG, or a separation ofGwith orderO(n(2\u2212&epsi;)/3inO(n1 + &epsi;+m) time.

Apartitionof a positive integernis a multiset of positive integers that add up to exactlyn, and aninteger partitionof a multisetSof integers is defined as the multiset union of partitions of integers inS. Given a sequence of multisetsS1,S2, \u2026,Skof integers, wherek\u2265 2, we say that a multiset is acommon integer partitionif it is an integer partition of every multisetSi, 1 \u2264i\u2264k. The MCIP problem is thus defined as to find a common integer partition ofS1,S2, \u2026,Skwith the minimum cardinality, denoted as MCIP(S1,S2, \u2026,Sk). It is easy to see that the MCIP problem is NP-hard, since it generalizes the well-known subset sum problem. We can in fact show that it is APX-hard.

An immediate consequence of our result is a compact linear relaxation withO(&verbar;V&verbar;2) constraints andO(&verbar;V&verbar;3) variables for enforcing global connectivity constraints. This relaxation is as strong as standard cut-based relaxations and has applications in solving traveling salesman problems by integer programming as well as finding approximate solutions for survivable network design problems using Jain's iterative rounding method.

That is, we are interested in sublinear algorithms for estimating the fraction of edge modifications (additions or deletions) that must be performed on a graph so that it obtainsP. This fraction is taken with respect to a given upper boundmon the number of edges. In particular, for graphs with degree bounddovernvertices,m&equals;dn. To perform such an approximation the algorithm may ask for the degree of any vertex of its choice, and may ask for the neighbors of any vertex.The problem of estimating the distance to having a property was first explicitly addressed by Parnas et al. [2006]. In the context of graphs this problem was studied by Fischer and Newman [2007] in the dense graphs model. In this model the fraction of edge modifications is taken with respect ton2, and the algorithm may ask for the existence of an edge between any pair of vertices of its choice. Fischer and Newman showed that every graph property that has a testing algorithm in this model, with query complexity independent of the size of the graph, also has a distance approximation algorithm with query complexity that is independent of the size of graph.In this work we focus on bounded-degree and general sparse graphs, and give algorithms for all properties shown to have efficient testing algorithms by Goldreich and Ron [2002]. Specifically, these properties arek-edge connectivity, subgraph freeness (for constant-size subgraphs), being an Eulerian graph, and cycle freeness. A variant of our subgraph-freeness algorithm approximates the size of a minimum vertex cover of a graph in sublinear time. This approximation improves on a recent result of Parnas and Ron [2007].", "authors": [{"name": "sharon marko", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81416607126"}, {"name": "dana ron", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100218595"}], "title": "Approximating the distance to properties in bounded-degree and general sparse graphs", "citations": [{"Name": "Oded Goldreich", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "The program of the mini-workshop", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Oded Goldreich", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "The program of the mini-workshop", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Krzysztof Onak", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sublinear graph approximation algorithms", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Krzysztof Onak", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sublinear graph approximation algorithms", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alan Edelman ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Avinatan Hassidim ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Huy N.

The input to the problem consists ofnjobs andkparallel machines. Each job is associated with a set of time intervals in which it can be scheduled (given either explicitly or nonexplicitly), a weight, and a family. Each family is associated with a processing time. Jobs that belong to the same family can be batched and executed together on the same machine. The processing time of each batch is the processing time of the family of jobs it contains. The goal is to find a nonpreemptive schedule with batching that maximizes the weight of the scheduled jobs.

The problem is to determine the optimal order in which to apply a given set of commutative filters (predicates) to a set of elements (the tuples of a relation), so as to find, as efficiently as possible, the tuples that satisfy all of the filters. Optimization of pipelined filter ordering has recently received renewed attention in the context of environments such as the Web, continuous high-speed data streams, and sensor networks. Pipelined filter ordering problems are also studied in areas such as fault detection and machine learning under names such as learning with attribute costs, minimum-sum set cover, and satisficing search. We present algorithms for two natural extensions of the classical pipelined filter ordering problem: (1) adistributional-typeproblem where the filters run in parallel and the goal is to maximize throughput, and (2) anadversarial-typeproblem where the goal is to minimize the expected value ofmultiplicative regret. We present two related algorithms for solving (1), both running in timeO(n2), which improve on theO(n3logn) algorithm of Kodialam.

Furthermore, the trade-off between the stretchtand the size of the data structure is essentially optimal.In this article, we show that we can actually construct approximate distance oracles in expectedO(n2) time if the graph is unweighted.

The protocol is suitable for the broadcast of compressed video and it can be implemented so that video information is packaged into discrete fixed length packets incurring only a modest overhead (measured in terms of increased delay).Our primary contribution is a lower bound on the required delay that applies to all protocols. This lower bound matches the behavior of our just-in-time protocol in the limit as the number of segments approaches infinity, provided the video compression satisfies some uniform upper bound.

More specifically, the new data structure supportsinsert,meldandfind-minoperations inO(1) amortized time, anddeleteoperations inO(pq(n) &plus; \u03b1(n)) amortized time, where \u03b1(n) is a functional inverse of the Ackermann function, and wherenthis time is the total number of operations performed on all the priority queues. The construction is very simple. The meldable priority queues are obtained by placing a nonmeldable priority queues at each node of a union-find data structure. We also show that when all keys are integers in the range [1,N], we can replacenin the bound stated previously by min&lcub;n,N&rcub;.Applying this result to the nonmeldable priority queue data structures obtained recently by Thorup [2002b] and by Han and Thorup [2002] we obtain meldable RAM priority queues withO(log logn) amortized time per operation, orO(&sqrt;log logn) expected amortized time per operation, respectively. As a by-product, we obtain improved algorithms for the minimum directed spanning tree problem on graphs with integer edge weights, namely, a deterministicO(mlog logn)-time algorithm and a randomizedO(m&sqrt;log logn)-time algorithm.

In a general online network design problem, we have a communication network known to the algorithm in advance. What is not known in advance are the connectivity (bandwidth) or cut demands between vertices in the network which arrive online.We develop a unified framework for designing online algorithms for problems involving connectivity and cuts. We first present a generalO(logm)-competitive deterministic algorithm for generating a fractional solution that satisfies the online connectivity or cut demands, wheremis the number of edges in the graph. This may be of independent interest for solving fractional online bandwidth allocation problems, and is applicable to both directed and undirected graphs. We then show how to obtain integral solutions via an online rounding of the fractional solution. This part of the framework is problem dependent, and applies various tools including results on approximate max-flow min-cut for multicommodity flow, the Hierarchically Separated Trees (HST) method and its extensions, certain rounding techniques for dependent variables, and R\u00e4cke's new hierarchical decomposition of graphs.Specifically, our results for the integral case include anO(logmlogn)-competitive randomized algorithm for the online nonmetric facility location problem and for a generalization of the problem called the multicast problem. In the nonmetric facility location problem,mis the number of facilities andnis the number of clients. The competitive ratio is nearly tight. We also present anO(log2nlogk)-competitive randomized algorithm for the online group Steiner problem in trees and anO(log3nlogk)-competitive randomized algorithm for the problem in general graphs, wherenis the number of vertices in the graph andkis the number of groups. Finally, we design a deterministicO(log3nlog logn)-competitive algorithm for the online multi-cut problem.", "authors": [{"name": "noga alon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100305768"}, {"name": "baruch awerbuch", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100453798"}, {"name": "yossi azar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100215093"}, {"name": "niv buchbinder", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100488730"}, {"name": "joseph seffi naor", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351600927"}], "title": "A general approach to online network optimization problems", "citations": [{"Name": "Anupam Gupta ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Viswanath Nagarajan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "R.

Suppose a provider offers a service to a set of potential customers. Each customer has a particular demand of service and her behavior is determined by a utility function that is nonincreasing in the sum of demands that are served by the provider.Classical game theory assumescomplete information: the provider has full knowledge of the behavior of all customers. We present a complete characterization of thecomplexity of computing optimal pricing strategiesand ofcomputing best/worst equilibriain this model. Basically, we show that most of these problems are inapproximable in the worst case but admit an FPAS in the average case. Our average case analysis covers large classes of distributions for customer utilities. We generalize our analysis to robust equilibria in which players change their strategies only when this promises a significant utility improvement.A more realistic model considers providers withincomplete information. Following the game theoretic framework of Bayesian games introduced by Harsanyi, the provider is aware of probability distributions describing the behavior of the customers and aims at estimating its expected revenue under best/worst equilibria. Somewhat counterintuitively, we obtain an FPRAS for the equilibria problem in the model with imperfect information although the problem with perfect information is inapproximable under the worst-case measures. In particular, the worst-case complexity of the considered problems increases with the precision of the available knowledge.", "authors": [{"name": "rene beier", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100373838"}, {"name": "artur czumaj", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100302463"}, {"name": "piotr krysta", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100124543"}, {"name": "berthold vocking", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100492810"}], "title": "Computing equilibria for a service provider game with (Im)perfect information", "citations": [{"Name": "Carol A.

We consider this problem with the objective of minimizing the sum of completion times of all storage devices. It is modeled by a transfer graph, where vertices represent the storage devices, and the edges indicate the data transfers required between pairs of devices. Each vertex has a nonnegative weight, and each edge has a release time and a processing time. A vertex completes when all the edges incident on it complete; the constraint is that two edges incident on the same vertex cannot be processed simultaneously. The objective is to minimize the sum of weighted completion times of all vertices. Kim (Journal of Algorithms, 55:42--57, 2005) gave a 9-approximation algorithm for the problem when edges have arbitrary processing times and are released at time zero. We improve Kim's result by giving a 5.06-approximation algorithm. We also address theopen shop schedulingproblem,O&verbar;rj&verbar; \u2211wjCj, and show that it is a special case of the data migration problem. Queyranne and Sviridenko (Journal of Scheduling, 5:287-305, 2002) gave a 5.83-approximation algorithm for the nonpreemptive version of the open shop problem. They state as an obvious open question whether there exists an algorithm for open shop scheduling that gives a performance guarantee better than 5.83. Our 5.06 algorithm for data migration proves the existence of such an algorithm. Crucial to our improved result is a property of the linear programming relaxation for the problem. Similar linear programs have been used for various other scheduling problems. Our technique may be useful in obtaining improved results for these problems as well.", "authors": [{"name": "rajiv gandhi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100294450"}, {"name": "magnus m halldorsson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100394927"}, {"name": "guy kortsarz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100337628"}, {"name": "hadas shachnai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100427015"}], "title": "Improved results for data migration and open shop scheduling", "citations": [{"Name": "Rajiv Gandhi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Magn\u00fas M.

In both variations of the problem, the robot can only move along the edges of the graph, for example, it cannot jump between nonadjacent nodes. In the tethered robot case, if the tether (rope) has lengthl, then the robot must remain within distancelfrom the start nodes. In the second variation, a fuel tank of limited capacity forces the robot to return tosafter traversingCedges. The efficiency of algorithms for both variations of the problem is measured by the number of edges traversed during the exploration. We present an algorithm for a tethered robot that explores the graph in \u0398(&verbar;E&verbar;) edge traversals.

In particular, approximations are often useful in a distributed setting where the inputs are held by different parties and may be extremely large. Furthermore, for some applications, the parties want to compute a function of their inputs securely without revealing more information than necessary. In this work, we study the question of simultaneously addressing the above efficiency and security concerns via what we callsecure approximations.We start by extending standard definitions of secure (exact) computation to the setting of secure approximations. Our definitions guarantee that no additional information is revealed by the approximation beyond what follows from the output of the function being approximated. We then study the complexity of specific secure approximation problems. In particular, we obtain a sublinear-communication protocol for securely approximating the Hamming distance and a polynomial-time protocol for securely approximating the permanent and related &num;P-hard problems.", "authors": [{"name": "joan feigenbaum", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100346986"}, {"name": "yuval ishai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100641155"}, {"name": "tal malkin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100032134"}, {"name": "kobbi nissim", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100023356"}, {"name": "martin j strauss", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100648412"}, {"name": "rebecca n wright", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100659919"}], "title": "Secure multiparty computation of approximations", "citations": [{"Name": "Shantanu D.

For everykpositions and every demand, there must be at least one string in the list that satisfies the demand at these positions. Problems of this form frequently arise in different fields in Computer Science.The standard approach for deterministically solving such problems is via almostk-wise independence ork-wise approximations for other distributions. We offer a generic algorithmic method that yields considerably smaller constructions. To this end, we generalize a previous work of Naor et al. [1995]. Among other results, we enhance the combinatorial objects in the heart of their method, called splitters, and constructmulti-way splitters, using a new discrete version of the topologicalNecklace Splitting Theorem[Alon 1987].We utilize our methods to show improved constructions forgroup testing[Ngo and Du 2000] andgeneralized hashing[Alon et al. 2003], and an improved inapproximability result for SET-COVER under the assumptionP&neq;NP.", "authors": [{"name": "noga alon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100305768"}, {"name": "dana moshkovitz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314484427"}, {"name": "shmuel safra", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100548079"}], "title": "Algorithmic construction of sets fork-restrictions", "citations": [{"Name": "Joseph S.

CIOQ switches, that comprise the backbone of packet routing networks, areN\u00d7Nswitches controlled by a switching policy that incorporates two components: Admission control and scheduling. An admission control strategy is essential to determine the packets stored in the FIFO queues in input and output ports, while the scheduling policy conducts the transfer of packets through the internal fabric, from input ports to output ports. The online problem of maximizing the total weighted throughput of CIOQ switches was recently investigated by Kesselman and Ros\u00e9n [2003]. They presented two different online algorithms for the general problem that achieve non-constant competitive ratios (linear in either the speedup or the number of distinct values, or logarithmic in the value range). We introduce the first constant-competitive algorithm for the general case of the problem, with arbitrary speedup and packet values.

We demonstrate how easy and versatile they are to use on a host of different applications. For example, we show how to maintain the diameter, center, and median of each tree in the forest. The forest can be updated by insertion and deletion of edges and by changes to vertex and edge weights. Each update is supported inO(logn) time, wherenis the size of the tree(s) involved in the update. Also, we show how to support nearest common ancestor queries and level ancestor queries with respect to arbitrary roots inO(logn) time. Finally, with marked and unmarked vertices, we show how to compute distances to a nearest marked vertex. The latter has applications to approximate nearest marked vertex in general graphs, and thereby to static optimization problems over shortest path metrics.Technically speaking, top trees are easily implemented either with Frederickson's [1997a] topology trees or with Sleator and Tarjan's [1983] dynamic trees. However, we claim that the interface is simpler for many applications, and indeed our new bounds are quadratic improvements over previous bounds where they exist.", "authors": [{"name": "stephen alstrup", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100490145"}, {"name": "jacob holm", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100557320"}, {"name": "kristian de lichtenberg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309509487"}, {"name": "mikkel thorup", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100560134"}], "title": "Maintaining information in fully dynamic trees with top trees", "citations": [{"Name": "Philip N.

An edge-cost flow problem is a min-cost flow problem in which the cost of the flow equals the sum of the costs of the edges carrying positive flow.We prove a hardness result for the Minimum Edge Cost Flow Problem (MECF). Using the one-round two-prover scenario, we prove that MECF does not admit a 2log1-&epsiv;n-ratio approximation, for every constant &epsiv; > 0, unlessNP\u2286DTIME(npolylogn).A restricted version of MECF, called Infinite Capacity MECF (ICF), is defined. The ICF problem is defined as follows: (i) all edges have infinite capacity, (ii) there are multiple sources and sinks, where flow can be delivered from every source to every sink, (iii) each source and sink has a supply amount and demand amount, respectively, and (iv) the required total flow is given as part of the input. The goal is to find a minimum edge-cost flow that meets the required total flow while obeying the demands of the sinks and the supplies of the sources. This problem naturally arises in practical scheduling applications, and is equivalent to the special case of single source MECF, with all edges not touching the source or the sink having infinite capacity.The directed ICF generalizes the Covering Steiner Problem in directed and undirected graphs. The undirected version of ICF generalizes several network design problems, such as: Steiner Tree Problem,k-MST, Point-to-point Connection Problem, and the generalized Steiner Tree Problem.AnO(logx)-approximation algorithm for undirected ICF is presented. We also present a bi-criteria approximation algorithm for directed ICF. The algorithm for directed ICF finds a flow that delivers half the required flow at a cost that is at mostO(n&epsiv;/&epsiv;4) times bigger than the cost of an optimal flow. The running time of the algorithm isO(x2/&epsiv;&cdot;n1+1/&epsiv;), wherexdenotes the required total flow.Randomized approximation algorithms for the Covering Steiner Problem in directed and undirected graphs are presented. The algorithms are based on a randomized reduction to a problem called 1/2-Group Steiner. In undirected graphs, the approximation ratio matches the approximation ratio of Konjevod et al. [2002]. However, our algorithm is much simpler. In directed graphs, the algorithm is the first nontrivial approximation algorithm for the Covering Steiner Problem. Deterministic algorithms are obtained by derandomization.", "authors": [{"name": "guy even", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100551986"}, {"name": "guy kortsarz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100337628"}, {"name": "wolfgang slany", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100209963"}], "title": "On network design problems: fixed cost flows and the covering steiner problem", "citations": [{"Name": "Masoud T.

In this article, we prove that the (k,r)-center problem, parameterized bykandR, is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) on planar graphs, i.e., it admits an algorithm of complexityf(k,r)nO(1)where the functionfis independent ofn. In particular, we show thatf(k,r) = 2O(rlogr) &ksqrt;, where the exponent of the exponential term grows sublinearly in the number of centers. Moreover, we prove that the same type of FPT algorithms can be designed for the more general class ofmap graphsintroduced by Chen, Grigni, and Papadimitriou. Our results combine dynamic-programming algorithms for graphs of small branchwidth and a graph-theoretic result bounding this parameter in terms ofkandr. Finally, a byproduct of our algorithm is the existence of a PTAS for ther-domination problem in both planar graphs and map graphs.Our approach builds on the seminal results of Robertson and Seymour on Graph Minors, and as a result is much more powerful than the previous machinery of Alber et al. for exponential speedup on planar graphs. To demonstrate the versatility of our results, we show how our algorithms can be extended to general parameters that are \u201clarge\u201d on grids. In addition, our use of branchwidth instead of the usual treewidth allows us to obtain much faster algorithms, and requires more complicated dynamic programming than the standard leaf/introduce/forget/join structure of nice tree decompositions. Our results are also unique in that they apply to classes of graphs that are not minor-closed, namely, constant powers of planar graphs and map graphs.", "authors": [{"name": "erik d demaine", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100553346"}, {"name": "fedor v fomin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100282175"}, {"name": "mohammadtaghi hajiaghayi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100596923"}, {"name": "dimitrios m thilikos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100042858"}], "title": "Fixed-parameter algorithms for (k,r)-center in planar graphs and map graphs", "citations": [{"Name": "Michael R.

Here we propose an approximation algorithm for the weighted matching problem in graphs which can be solved in polynomial time. The weighted matching problem is to find a matching in an edge weighted graph that has maximum weight. The first polynomial-time algorithm for this problem was given by Edmonds in 1965. The fastest known algorithm for the weighted matching problem has a running time ofO(nm+n2logn). Many real world problems require graphs of such large size that this running time is too costly. Therefore, there is considerable need for faster approximation algorithms for the weighted matching problem. We present a linear-time approximation algorithm for the weighted matching problem with a performance ratio arbitrarily close to 2/3. This improves the previously best performance ratio of 1/2. Our algorithm is not only of theoretical interest, but because it is easy to implement and the constants involved are quite small it is also useful in practice.", "authors": [{"name": "doratha e drake vinkemeier", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350595744"}, {"name": "stefan hougardy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100330995"}], "title": "A linear-time approximation algorithm for weighted matchings in graphs", "citations": [{"Name": "Stefan Hougardy ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Doratha E.

In this article, we examine the effect on the complexity of pricing when two flexibility-enhancing mechanisms are incorporated into the network model. In particular, we study a model where the session is offered at a number of different rates of transmission, and where there is a cost for enabling multicasting at each node of the network. We consider two techniques that have been used in practice to provide multiple rates: using a layered transmission scheme (called thelayered paradigm) and using different multicast groups for each possible rate (called thesplit session paradigm). We demonstrate that the difference between these two paradigms has a significant impact on the complexity of pricing multicasting.For the layered paradigm, we provide a distributed algorithm for computing pricing efficiently in terms of local computation and message complexity. For the split session paradigm, on the other hand, we demonstrate that this problem can be solved in polynomial time if the number of possible rates is fixed, but if the number of rates is part of the input, then the problem becomes NP-Hard even to approximate. We also examine the effect of delivering the transmissions for the various rates from different locations within the network. We show that, in this case, the pricing problem becomes NP-Hard for the split session paradigm even for a fixed constant number of possible rates but if layering is used, then it can be solved in polynomial time by formulating the problem as a totally unimodular integer program.", "authors": [{"name": "micah adler", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100059176"}, {"name": "dan rubenstein", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100624099"}], "title": "Pricing multicasting in more flexible network models", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "6\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "619\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of massachusetts amherst amherst ma", "city": null, "Name": "micah adler"}, {"country": "United Kingdom", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "columbia university new york ny", "city": "york", "Name": "dan rubenstein"}]}, "Pages: 160-176": {"references": ["Aaronson, S. 2003.

One way to achieve this is to use joint signed binary digit expansions of small \u201cweight.\u201d We study two algorithms, one based on nonadjacent forms of the coefficients of the linear combination, the other based on a certain joint sparse form specifically adapted to this problem. Both methods are sped up using the sliding windows approach combined with precomputed lookup tables. We give explicit and asymptotic results for the number of group operations needed, assuming uniform distribution of the coefficients. Expected values, variances and a central limit theorem are proved using generating functions.Furthermore, we provide a new algorithm that calculates the digits of an optimal expansion of pairs of integers from left to right. This avoids storing the whole expansion, which is needed with the previously known right-to-left methods, and allows an online computation.", "authors": [{"name": "peter j grabner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100260447"}, {"name": "clemens heuberger", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100277765"}, {"name": "helmut prodinger", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100062277"}, {"name": "jorg m thuswaldner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100239153"}], "title": "Analysis of linear combination algorithms in cryptography", "citations": [{"Name": "Clemens Heuberger ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "James A.
