In this article, we propose a novel approach to recognize inference with probabilistic logical reasoning. Our approach is built on Markov logic networks (MLNs) framework, which is a probabilistic extension of first-order logic. We design specific semantic rules based on the surface, syntactic, and semantic representations of texts, and map these rules to logical representations. We also extract information from some knowledge bases as common sense logic rules. Then we utilize MLNs framework to make predictions with combining statistical and logical reasoning. Experiment results shows that our system can achieve better performance than state-of-the-art RITE systems.", "authors": [{"name": "xipeng qiu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81300040101"}, {"name": "ling cao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81549082256"}, {"name": "zhao liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81486652530"}, {"name": "xuanjing huang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81414610034"}], "title": "Recognizing Inference in Texts with Markov Logic Networks", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "34\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "212\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "china", "university": "fudan university", "affiliation_string": "fudan university", "city": "shanghai", "Name": "xipeng qiu"}, {"country": "china", "university": "fudan university", "affiliation_string": "fudan university", "city": "shanghai", "Name": "ling cao"}, {"country": "china", "university": "fudan university", "affiliation_string": "fudan university", "city": "shanghai", "Name": "zhao liu"}, {"country": "china", "university": "fudan university", "affiliation_string": "fudan university", "city": "shanghai", "Name": "xuanjing huang"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Akiba, Y., Taira, H., Fujita, S., Kasahara, K., and Nagata, M.2011.

We quantitatively analyze the effects of various entailment features, machine learning algorithms, and the impact of RTE resources on the performance of an RTE system. This article also investigates the use of machine translation for the RTE task and determines whether machine translation can be used to improve the performance of our RTE system. Experimental results achieved on benchmark data sets show that our machine learning-based RTE system outperforms the baseline methods based on lexical matching and syntactic matching.

In this article, we explore the effectiveness of different types of currently available resources including synonyms, antonyms, hypernym-hyponym relations, and lexical entailment relations for the task of textual entailment recognition. In order to do so, we develop an entailment relation recognition system which utilizes diverse linguistic analyses and resources to align the linguistic units in a pair of texts and identifies entailment relations based on these alignments. We use the Japanese subset of the NTCIR-9 RITE-1 dataset for evaluation and error analysis, conducting ablation testing and evaluation on hand-crafted alignment gold standard data to evaluate the contribution of individual resources. Error analysis shows that existing knowledge sources are effective for RTE, but that their coverage is limited, especially for domain-specific and other low-frequency expressions. To increase alignment coverage on such expressions, we propose a method ofalignment inferencethat uses syntactic and semantic dependency information to identify likely alignments without relying on external resources. Evaluation adding alignment inference to a system using all available knowledge sources shows improvements in both precision and recall of entailment relation recognition.", "authors": [{"name": "yotaro watanabe", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81551093756"}, {"name": "junta mizuno", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81472641960"}, {"name": "eric nichols", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418593054"}, {"name": "katsuma narisawa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81550888456"}, {"name": "keita nabeshima", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81550770656"}, {"name": "naoaki okazaki", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309496001"}, {"name": "kentaro inui", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329489552"}], "title": "Leveraging Diverse Lexical Resources for Textual Entailment Recognition", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "21\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "204\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "japan", "university": "tohoku university", "affiliation_string": "tohoku university", "city": "sendai", "Name": "yotaro watanabe"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "tohoku university", "affiliation_string": "tohoku university", "city": "sendai", "Name": "junta mizuno"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "tohoku university", "affiliation_string": "tohoku university", "city": "sendai", "Name": "eric nichols"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "tohoku university", "affiliation_string": "tohoku university", "city": "sendai", "Name": "katsuma narisawa"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "tohoku university", "affiliation_string": "tohoku university", "city": "sendai", "Name": "keita nabeshima"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "tohoku university", "affiliation_string": "tohoku university", "city": "sendai", "Name": "naoaki okazaki"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "tohoku university", "affiliation_string": "tohoku university", "city": "sendai", "Name": "kentaro inui"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["Ion Androutsopoulos , Prodromos Malakasiotis, A survey of paraphrasing and textual entailment methods, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, v.38 n.1, p.135-187, May 2010\n", "Angele, J., Moench, E., Oppermann, H., Staab, S., and Wenke, D.2003.

Questions in several fields, such as history and politics, primarily test the examinee\u2019s knowledge in the form of choosing true statements from multiple choices. Answering such questions can be regarded as equivalent to finding evidential texts from a textbase such as textbooks and Wikipedia. Therefore, this task can be recast as recognizing textual entailment between a description in a textbase and a statement given in a question. We focused on the National Center Test for University Admission in Japan and converted questions into the evaluation data for textual entailment recognition by using Wikipedia as a textbase. Consequently, it is revealed that nearly half of the questions can be mapped into textual entailment recognition; 941 text pairs were created from 404 questions from six subjects. This data set is provided for a subtask of NTCIR RITE (Recognizing Inference in Text), and 16 systems from six teams used the data set for evaluation. The evaluation results revealed that the best system achieved a correct answer ratio of 56&percnt;, which is significantly better than a random choice baseline.", "authors": [{"name": "yusuke miyao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100124297"}, {"name": "hideki shima", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453633961"}, {"name": "hiroshi kanayama", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100050211"}, {"name": "teruko mitamura", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100441791"}], "title": "Evaluating Textual Entailment Recognition for University Entrance Examinations", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "38\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "202\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "yusuke miyao"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "hideki shimacarnegie mellon university"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "hiroshi kanayamaibm research - tokyo"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "hiroshi kanayama", "city": null, "Name": "teruko mitamuracarnegie mellon university"}]}, "Article No.: 16": {"references": ["Aizawa, A.2008.

By measuring the availability of mismatch conjunction phrases (MCPs), the background knowledge about two target statements can be implicitly obtained for identifying contradictions.

The pFOIL algorithm integrates inductive logic programming (ILP), First-Order Inductive Learning (FOIL), and a penalized log-likelihood function for error diagnosis. This algorithm considers the uncertain, imperfect, and conflicting characteristics of Chinese sentences to infer error types and produce human-interpretable rules for further error correction. In a pFOIL algorithm, relation pattern background knowledge and quantizedt-score background knowledge are proposed to characterize a sentence and then used for likelihood estimation. The relation pattern background knowledge captures the morphological, syntactic and semantic relations among the words in a sentence. One or two kinds of the extracted relations are then integrated into a pattern to characterize a sentence. The quantizedt-score values are used to characterize various relations of a sentence for quantizedt-score background knowledge representation. Afterwards, a decomposition-based testing mechanism which decomposes a sentence into background knowledge set needed for each error type is proposed to infer all potential error types and causes of the sentence. With the pFOIL method, not only the error types but also the error causes and positions can be provided for CSL learners. Experimental results reveal that the pFOIL method outperforms the C4.5, maximum entropy, and Naive Bayes classifiers in error classification.", "authors": [{"name": "ru-yng chang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310482364"}, {"name": "chung-hsien wu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350591456"}, {"name": "philips kokoh prasetyo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81498658507"}], "title": "Error Diagnosis of Chinese Sentences Using Inductive Learning Algorithm and Decomposition-Based Testing Mechanism", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "48\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "238\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "taiwan", "university": "national cheng kung university", "affiliation_string": "national cheng kung university", "city": "tainan", "Name": "ru-yng chang"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "national cheng kung university", "affiliation_string": "national cheng kung university", "city": "tainan", "Name": "chung-hsien wu"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "national cheng kung university", "affiliation_string": "national cheng kung university", "city": "tainan", "Name": "philips kokoh prasetyo"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Abuleil, S.2004.

Many researchers have addressed the name identification issue in a variety of languages and recently some research efforts have started to focus on named entity recognition for the Arabic language. We present a working Arabic information extraction (IE) system that is used to analyze large volumes of news texts every day to extract the named entity (NE) types person, organization, location, date, and number, as well as quotations (direct reported speech) by and about people. The named entity recognition (NER) system was not developed for Arabic, but instead a multilingual NER system was adapted to also cover Arabic. The Semitic language Arabic substantially differs from the Indo-European and Finno-Ugric languages currently covered. This article thus describes what Arabic language-specific resources had to be developed and what changes needed to be made to the rule set in order to be applicable to the Arabic language. The achieved evaluation results are generally satisfactory, but could be improved for certain entity types.", "authors": [{"name": "wajdi zaghouani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81470653038"}], "title": "RENAR: A Rule-Based Arabic Named Entity Recognition System", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "49\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "403\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of pennsylvania", "city": null, "Name": "wajdi zaghouani"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["Ager, S.2009.

The nine major Indian regional scripts are Bangla (for Bengali and Assamese languages), Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Gurumukhi (for Punjabi language), Tamil, Telugu, and Nastaliq (for Urdu language). A state-of-the-art survey about the techniques available in the area of offline handwriting recognition (OHR) in Indian regional scripts will be of a great aid to the researchers in the subcontinent and hence a sincere attempt is made in this article to discuss the advancements reported in this regard during the last few decades. The survey is organized into different sections. A brief introduction is given initially about automatic recognition of handwriting and official regional scripts in India. The nine regional scripts are then categorized into four subgroups based on their similarity and evolution information. The first group contains Bangla, Oriya, Gujarati and Gurumukhi scripts. The second group contains Kannada and Telugu scripts and the third group contains Tamil and Malayalam scripts. The fourth group contains only Nastaliq script (Perso-Arabic script for Urdu), which is not an Indo-Aryan script. Various feature extraction and classification techniques associated with the offline handwriting recognition of the regional scripts are discussed in this survey. As it is important to identify the script before the recognition step, a section is dedicated to handwritten script identification techniques. A benchmarking database is very important for any pattern recognition related research. The details of the datasets available in different Indian regional scripts are also mentioned in the article. A separate section is dedicated to the observations made, future scope, and existing difficulties related to handwriting recognition in Indian regional scripts. We hope that this survey will serve as a compendium not only for researchers in India, but also for policymakers and practitioners in India. It will also help to accomplish a target of bringing the researchers working on different Indian scripts together. Looking at the recent developments in OHR of Indian regional scripts, this article will provide a better platform for future research activities.", "authors": [{"name": "umapada pal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309487326"}, {"name": "ramachandran jayadevan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81498657843"}, {"name": "nabin sharma", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339527945"}], "title": "Handwriting Recognition in Indian Regional Scripts: A Survey of Offline Techniques", "citations": [{"Name": "Yi Zhuang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Qing Li ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dickson K.

Given a latent relational search query {(Japan, Tokyo), (France, ?)}, a latent relational search engine is expected to retrieve and rank the entity \u201cParis\u201d as the first answer in the result list. A latent relational search engine extracts entities and relations between those entities from a corpus, such as the Web. Moreover, from some supporting sentences in the corpus, (e.g., \u201cTokyo is the capital of Japan\u201d and \u201cParis is the capital and biggest city of France\u201d), the search engine must recognize the relational similarity between the two entity pairs. In cross-language latent relational search, the entity pairs as well as the supporting sentences of the first entity pair and of the second entity pair are in different languages. Therefore, the search engine must recognize similar semantic relations across languages. In this article, we study the problem of cross-language latent relational search between Japanese and English using Web data. To perform cross-language latent relational search in high speed, we propose a multi-lingual indexing method for storing entities and lexical patterns that represent the semantic relations extracted from Web corpora. We then propose a hybrid lexical pattern clustering algorithm to capture the semantic similarity between lexical patterns across languages. Using this algorithm, we can precisely measure the relational similarity between entity pairs across languages, thereby achieving high precision in the task of cross-language latent relational search. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves an MRR of 0.605 on Japanese-English cross-language latent relational search query sets and it also achieves a reasonable performance on the INEX Entity Ranking task.", "authors": [{"name": "nguyen tuan duc", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413598224"}, {"name": "danushka bollegala", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81500657281"}, {"name": "mitsuru ishizuka", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548005168"}], "title": "Cross-Language Latent Relational Search between Japanese and English Languages Using a Web Corpus", "citations": [{"Name": "Bilel Elayeb ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ibrahim Bounhas", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "20\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "162\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of tokyo", "city": null, "Name": "nguyen tuan duc"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of tokyo", "city": null, "Name": "danushka bollegala"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of tokyo", "city": null, "Name": "mitsuru ishizuka"}]}, "Article No.: 8": {"references": ["Eugene Charniak , Mark Johnson, Coarse-to-finen-best parsing and MaxEnt discriminative reranking, Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics, p.173-180, June 25-30, 2005, Ann Arbor, Michigan[doi>10.3115/1219840.1219862]\n", "Michael Collins , Philipp Koehn , Ivona Ku\u010derov\u00e1, Clause restructuring for statistical machine translation, Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics, p.531-540, June 25-30, 2005, Ann Arbor, Michigan[doi>10.3115/1219840.1219906]\n", "de Marneffe, M.-C., MacCartney, B., and Manning, C.

Typical phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) systems such as Moses search for the best word permutation within a given distance limit (distortion limit). For English-to-Japanese translation, we need a large distance limit to obtain acceptable translations, and the number of translation candidates is extremely large. Therefore, SMT systems often fail to find acceptable translations within a limited time. To solve this problem, some researchers use rule-based preprocessing approaches, which reorder English words just like Japanese by using dozens of rules. Our idea is based on the following two observations: (1) Japanese is a typical head-final language, and (2) we can detect heads of English sentences by a head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG) parser. The main contributions of this article are twofold: First, we demonstrate how off-the-shelf, state-of-the-art HPSG parser enables us to write the reordering rules in an abstract level and can easily improve the quality of English-to-Japanese translation. Second, we also show that syntactic heads achieve better results than semantic heads.

The corpus used in the experiment is a 4,392-sentence corpus (55,015 words with an average of 13 words per sentence). Because the corpus contains speaker-dependent variability and such variability is not appropriately reflected in a general purpose speech synthesis system, a method to reduce such variability is proposed.

The general idea is based on the assumption that similar words have similar contexts across languages. However, previous studies have mainly focused on Indo-European languages, or use only a bag-of-words model to describe the context. Furthermore, we argue that it is helpful to extract only the statistically significant context, instead of using all context. The present approach addresses these issues in the following manner. First, based on the context of a word with an unknown translation (query word), we extract salient pivot words. Pivot words are words for which a translation is already available in a bilingual dictionary. For the extraction of salient pivot words, we use a Bayesian estimation of the point-wise mutual information to measure statistical significance. In the second step, we match these pivot words across languages to identify translation candidates for the query word. We therefore calculate a similarity score between the query word and a translation candidate using the probability that the same pivots will be extracted for both the query word and the translation candidate. The proposed method uses several context positions, namely, a bag-of-words of one sentence, and the successors, predecessors, and siblings with respect to the dependency parse tree of the sentence. In order to make these context positions comparable across Japanese and English, which are unrelated languages, we use several heuristics to adjust the dependency trees appropriately. We demonstrate that the proposed method significantly increases the accuracy of word translations, as compared to previous methods.", "authors": [{"name": "daniel andrade", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81461649182"}, {"name": "takuya matsuzaki", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310490814"}, {"name": "junichi tsujii", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81493650770"}], "title": "Statistical Extraction and Comparison of Pivot Words for Bilingual Lexicon Extension", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "13\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "145\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of tokyo", "city": null, "Name": "daniel andrade"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of tokyo", "city": null, "Name": "takuya matsuzaki"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of tokyo", "city": null, "Name": "junichi tsujii"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Galen Andrew, A hybrid Markov/semi-Markov conditional random field for sequence segmentation, Proceedings of the 2006 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, July 22-23, 2006, Sydney, Australia\n", "Asahara, M., Fukuoka, K., Azuma, A., Goh, C.-L., Watanabe, Y., Matsumoto, Y., and Tsuzuki, T.2005.

The former gives excellent performance for thein-vocabulary(IV) words; however, it handlesout-of-vocabulary(OOV) words poorly. On the other hand, though the latter is more robust for OOV words, it fails to deliver satisfactory performance for IV words. These two approaches behave differently due to the unit they use (word vs. character) and the model form they adopt (generative vs. discriminative). In general, character-based approaches are more robust than word-based ones, as the vocabulary of characters is a closed set; and discriminative models are more robust than generative ones, since they can flexibly include all kinds of available information, such as future context.This article first proposes a character-basedn-gram model to enhance the robustness of the generative approach. Then the proposed generative model is further integrated with the character-based discriminative model to take advantage of both approaches. Our experiments show that this integrated approach outperforms all the existing approaches reported in the literature. Afterwards, a complete and detailed error analysis is conducted. Since a significant portion of the critical errors is related to numerical/foreign strings, character-type information is then incorporated into the model to further improve its performance. Last, the proposed integrated approach is tested on cross-domain corpora, and a semi-supervised domain adaptation algorithm is proposed and shown to be effective in our experiments.", "authors": [{"name": "kun wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81472643337"}, {"name": "chengqing zong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329493259"}, {"name": "keh-yih su", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451593455"}], "title": "Integrating Generative and Discriminative Character-Based Models for Chinese Word Segmentation", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "49\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "326\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national laboratory of pattern recognition institute of automation chinese academy of sciences", "city": null, "Name": "kun wang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national laboratory of pattern recognition institute of automation chinese academy of sciences", "city": null, "Name": "chengqing zong"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Andreevskaia, A. and Bergler, S.2008.

We conducted extensive experiments on English movie review data and multi-domain sentiment dataset as well as Chinese product reviews about mobile phones, digital cameras, MP3 players, and monitors. The results show that while both LDA-DP and LDA-GE perform comparably to existing weakly supervised sentiment classification algorithms, they are much simpler and computationally efficient, rendering them more suitable for online and real-time sentiment classification on the Web. We observed that LDA-GE is more effective than LDA-DP, suggesting that it should be preferred when considering employing the topic model for sentiment analysis.

In particular, a topic modeling approach is employed for salience determination and a dynamic modeling approach is proposed for redundancy control. In the topic modeling approach for salience determination, we represent various kinds of text units, such as word, sentence, document, documents, and summary, using a single vector space model via their corresponding probability distributions over the inherent topics of given documents or a related corpus. Therefore, we are able to calculate the similarity between any two text units via their topic probability distributions. In the dynamic modeling approach for redundancy control, we consider the similarity between the summary and the given documents, and the similarity between the sentence and the summary, besides the similarity between the sentence and the given documents, for standard summarization while for update summarization, we also consider the similarity between the sentence and the history documents or summary. Evaluation on TAC 2008 and 2009 in English language shows encouraging results, especially the dynamic modeling approach in removing the redundancy in the given documents. Finally, we extend the framework to Chinese multi-document summarization and experiments show the effectiveness of our framework.", "authors": [{"name": "hongling wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442605173"}, {"name": "guodong zhou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81408601310"}], "title": "Toward a Unified Framework for Standard and Update Multi-Document Summarization", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "22\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "244\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "taiwan", "university": "soochow university", "affiliation_string": "soochow university", "city": "taibei", "Name": "hongling wang"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "soochow university", "affiliation_string": "soochow university", "city": "taibei", "Name": "guodong zhou"}]}}, "date": {"month": "June", "year": "2012"}}}, "Volume9": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Article No.: 15": {"references": ["Ace. 2005.

The Urdu language, in particular, has experienced explosive growth on the Web. Text mining for information discovery, which includes tasks such as identifying topics, relationships and events, and sentiment analysis, requires sophisticated natural language processing (NLP). NLP systems begin with modules such as word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and morphological analysis and progress to modules such as shallow parsing and named entity tagging. While there have been considerable advances in developing such comprehensive NLP systems for English, the work for Urdu is still in its infancy. The tasks of interest in Urdu NLP includes analyzing data sources such as blogs and comments to news articles to provide insight into social and human behavior. All of this requires a robust NLP system. The objective of this work is to develop an NLP infrastructure for Urdu that is customizable and capable of providing basic analysis on which more advanced information extraction tools can be built. This system assimilates resources from various online sources to facilitate improved named entity tagging and Urdu-to-English transliteration. The annotated data required to train the learning models used here is acquired by standardizing the currently limited resources available for Urdu. Techniques such as bootstrap learning and resource sharing from a syntactically similar language, Hindi, are explored to augment the available annotated Urdu data. Each of the new Urdu text processing modules has been integrated into a general text-mining platform. The evaluations performed demonstrate that the accuracies have either met or exceeded the state of the art.", "authors": [{"name": "smruthi mukund", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81438592490"}, {"name": "rohini srihari", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100243324"}, {"name": "erik peterson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81546427756"}], "title": "An Information-Extraction System for Urdu---A Resource-Poor Language", "citations": [{"Name": "Smruthi Mukund ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Debanjan Ghosh ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rohini K.

But the resource-scarce languages do not enjoy the luxury of large parallel transliteration corpus. For these languages, rule-based transliteration is the only viable option. In this article, we show that by properly harnessing the monolingual resources in conjunction with manually created rule base, one can achieve reasonable transliteration performance. We achieve this performance by exploiting the power of Character Sequence Modeling (CSM), which requires only monolingual resources. We present the results of our rule-based system for Hindi to English, English to Hindi, and Persian to English transliteration tasks. We also perform extrinsic evaluation of transliteration systems in the context of Cross Lingual Information Retrieval.

In this article, we propose compositional machine transliteration systems, where multiple transliteration components may be composed either to improve existing transliteration quality, or to enable transliteration functionality between languages even when no direct parallel names corpora exist between them. Specifically, we propose two distinct forms of composition: serial and parallel. Serial compositional system chains individual transliteration components, say, X \u2192 Y and Y \u2192 Z systems, to provide transliteration functionality, X \u2192 Z. In parallel composition evidence from multiple transliteration paths between X \u2192 Z are aggregated for improving the quality of a direct system. We demonstrate the functionality and performance benefits of the compositional methodology using a state-of-the-art machine transliteration framework in English and a set of Indian languages, namely, Hindi, Marathi, and Kannada. Finally, we underscore the utility and practicality of our compositional approach by showing that a CLIR system integrated with compositional transliteration systems performs consistently on par with, and sometimes better than, that integrated with a direct transliteration system.", "authors": [{"name": "a kumaran", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384599788"}, {"name": "mitesh m khapra", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81458651607"}, {"name": "pushpak bhattacharyya", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331488601"}], "title": "Compositional Machine Transliteration", "citations": [{"Name": "Dinesh Kumar Prabhakar ", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sukomal Pal", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Aditya Bhargava ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Grzegorz Kondrak", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Leveraging supplemental representations for sequential transduction", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "20\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "288\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "india", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research india", "city": null, "Name": "a kumaran"}, {"country": "india", "university": "indian institute of technology bombay", "affiliation_string": "indian institute of technology bombay", "city": "bombay", "Name": "mitesh m khapra"}, {"country": "india", "university": "indian institute of technology bombay", "affiliation_string": "indian institute of technology bombay", "city": "bombay", "Name": "pushpak bhattacharyya"}]}}, "date": {"month": "December", "year": "2010"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Bernhard, D.2007.

To address this problem, we present a hybrid approach that uses a small amount of linguistic knowledge in the form of orthographic rewrite rules to help refine an existing MI-produced segmentation. Using rules, we derive underlying analyses of morphs---generalized with respect to contextual spelling differences---from an existing surface morph segmentation, and from these we learn a morpheme-level segmentation. To learn morphemes, we have extended the Morfessor segmentation algorithm [Creutz and Lagus 2004; 2005; 2006] by using rules to infer possible underlying analyses from surface segmentations. A segmentation produced by Morfessor Categories-MAP Software v. 0.9.2 is used as input to our procedure and as a baseline that we evaluate against. To suggest analyses for our procedure, a set of language-specific orthographic rules is needed. Our procedure has yielded promising improvements for English and Turkish over the baseline approach when tested on the Morpho Challenge 2005 and 2007 style evaluations. On the Morpho Challenge 2007 test evaluation, we report gains over the current best unsupervised contestant for Turkish, where our technique shows a 2.5&percnt; absoluteF-score improvement.", "authors": [{"name": "michael tepper", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81458647450"}, {"name": "fei xia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100496648"}], "title": "Inducing Morphemes Using Light Knowledge", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "14\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "210\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "department of linguistics university of washington", "city": null, "Name": "michael tepper"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "department of linguistics university of washington", "city": null, "Name": "fei xia"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["Hsin-Hsi Chen , Sheng-Jie Hueng , Yung-Wei Ding , Shih-Chung Tsai, Proper name translation in cross-language information retrieval, Proceedings of the 17th international conference on Computational linguistics, August 10-14, 1998, Montreal, Quebec, Canada[doi>10.3115/980451.980883]\n", "Hsin-Hsi Chen , Wen-Cheng Lin , Changhua Yang , Wei-Hao Lin, Translating\u2013transliterating named entities for multilingual information access, Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, v.57 n.5, p.645-659, March 2006[doi>10.1002/asi.v57:5]\n", "Pu-Jen Cheng , Jei-Wen Teng , Ruei-Cheng Chen , Jenq-Haur Wang , Wen-Hsiang Lu , Lee-Feng Chien, Translating unknown queries with web corpora for cross-language information retrieval, Proceedings of the 27th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval, July 25-29, 2004, Sheffield, United Kingdom[doi>10.1145/1008992.1009020]\n", "Rudi L.

Using search engines to retrieve Web pages can gather lots of information, including foreign information. However, to be better understood by local readers, proper names in a foreign language, such as English, are often transliterated to a local language such as Chinese. Due to different translators and the lack of translation standard, translating foreign proper nouns may result in different transliterations and pose a notorious headache. In particular, it may cause incomplete search results. Using one transliteration as a query keyword will fail to retrieve the Web pages which use a different word as the transliteration. Consequently, important information may be missed. We present a framework for mining synonymous transliterations as many as possible from the Web for a given transliteration. The results can be used to construct a database of synonymous transliterations which can be utilized for query expansion so as to alleviate the incomplete search problem. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can effectively retrieve the set of snippets which may contain synonymous transliterations and then extract the target terms. Most of the extracted synonymous transliterations have higher rank of similarity to the input transliteration compared to other noise terms.", "authors": [{"name": "chung-chian hsu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309508228"}, {"name": "chien-hsing chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409596395"}], "title": "Mining Synonymous Transliterations from the World Wide Web", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "6\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "276\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "taiwan", "university": "national yunlin university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "national yunlin university of science and technology", "city": "douliu", "Name": "chung-chian hsu"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "national yunlin university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "national yunlin university of science and technology", "city": "douliu", "Name": "chien-hsing chen"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Agirre, E., Baldwin, T., and Martinez, D.2008.

We found that both of the two components impact the pipeline system, with more degradation in the entire system performance due to automatic speaker name recognition errors than soundbite segment detection. In addition, our experimental results show that using ASR output degrades the system performance significantly, and that using automatic sentence segmentation greatly impacts soundbite detection, but has much less effect on speaker name recognition.", "authors": [{"name": "feifan liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81448593581"}, {"name": "yang liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323493268"}], "title": "Identification of Soundbite and Its Speaker Name Using Transcripts of Broadcast News Speech", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "14\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "182\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of texas at dallas", "city": null, "Name": "feifan liu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of texas at dallas", "city": null, "Name": "yang liu"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2010"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Samir Abdou , Jacques Savoy, Statistical and comparative evaluation of various indexing and search models, Proceedings of the Third Asia conference on Information Retrieval Technology, October 16-18, 2006, Singapore[doi>10.1007/11880592_28]\n", "Riitta Alkula, From Plain Character Strings to Meaningful Words: Producing Better Full Text Databases for Inflectional and Compounding Languages with Morphological Analysis Software, Information Retrieval, v.4 n.3-4, p.195-208, September-December 2001[doi>10.1023/A:1011942104443]\n", "Gianni Amati , Cornelis Joost Van Rijsbergen, Probabilistic models of information retrieval based on measuring the divergence from randomness, ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS), v.20 n.4, p.357-389, October 2002[doi>10.1145/582415.582416]\n", "}}Beames, J.1891.Grammar of the Bengali Language, Literary, and Colloquial.

These three languages are ranked among the world\u2019s 20 most spoken languages and they share similar syntax, morphology, and writing systems. In this article we examine these languages from an Information Retrieval (IR) perspective through describing the key elements of their inflectional and derivational morphologies, and suggest a light and more aggressive stemming approach based on them.In our evaluation of these stemming strategies we make use of the FIRE 2008 test collections, and then to broaden our comparisons we implement and evaluate two language independent indexing methods: then-gram and trunc-n(truncation of the firstnletters). We evaluate these solutions by applying our various IR models, including the Okapi, Divergence from Randomness (DFR) and statistical language models (LM) together with two classical vector-space approaches:tf idfandLnu-ltc.Experiments performed with all three languages demonstrate that the I(ne)C2 model derived from the Divergence from Randomness paradigm tends to provide the best mean average precision (MAP). Our own tests suggest that improved retrieval effectiveness would be obtained by applying more aggressive stemmers, especially those accounting for certain derivational suffixes, compared to those involving a light stemmer or ignoring this type of word normalization procedure. Comparisons between no stemming and stemming indexing schemes shows that performance differences are almost always statistically significant. When, for example, an aggressive stemmer is applied, the relative improvements obtained are ~28&percnt; for the Hindi language, ~42&percnt; for Marathi, and ~18&percnt; for Bengali, as compared to a no-stemming approach. Based on a comparison of word-based and language-independent approaches we find that the trunc-4 indexing scheme tends to result in performance levels statistically similar to those of an aggressive stemmer, yet better than the 4-gram indexing scheme. A query-by-query analysis reveals the reasons for this, and also demonstrates the advantage of applying a stemming or a trunc-4 indexing scheme.", "authors": [{"name": "ljiljana dolamic", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384620971"}, {"name": "jacques savoy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100510252"}], "title": "Comparative Study of Indexing and Search Strategies for the Hindi, Marathi, and Bengali Languages", "citations": [{"Name": "Jiaul H.

Several research questions are explored in this article: 1) How to create create a simple, language-independent corpus-based stemmer, 2) How to identify sub-words and which types of sub-words are suitable as indexing units, and 3) How to apply blind relevance feedback on sub-words and how feedback term selection is affected by the type of the indexing unit. More than 140 IR experiments are conducted using the BM25 retrieval model on the topic titles and descriptions (TD) for the FIRE 2008 English, Bengali, Hindi, and Marathi document collections.The major findings are: The corpus-based stemming approach is effective as a knowledge-light term conflation step and useful in the case of few language-specific resources. For English, the corpus-based stemmer performs nearly as well as the Porter stemmer and significantly better than the baseline of indexing words when combined with query expansion. In combination with blind relevance feedback, it also performs significantly better than the baseline for Bengali and Marathi IR.Sub-words such as consonant-vowel sequences and word prefixes can yield similar or better performance in comparison to word indexing. There is no best performing method for all languages. For English, indexing using the Porter stemmer performs best, for Bengali and Marathi, overlapping 3-grams obtain the best result, and for Hindi, 4-prefixes yield the highest MAP. However, in combination with blind relevance feedback using 10 documents and 20 terms, 6-prefixes for English and 4-prefixes for Bengali, Hindi, and Marathi IR yield the highest MAP.Sub-word identification is a general case of decompounding. It results in one or more index terms for a single word form and increases the number of index terms but decreases their average length. The corresponding retrieval experiments show that relevance feedback on sub-words benefits from selecting a larger number of index terms in comparison with retrieval on word forms. Similarly, selecting the number of relevance feedback terms depending on the ratio of word vocabulary size to sub-word vocabulary size almost always slightly increases information retrieval effectiveness compared to using a fixed number of terms for different languages.", "authors": [{"name": "johannes leveling", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81377591606"}, {"name": "gareth j f jones", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100555564"}], "title": "Sub-Word Indexing and Blind Relevance Feedback for English, Bengali, Hindi, and Marathi IR", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "25\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "302\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "city university", "affiliation_string": "dublin city university", "city": "london", "Name": "johannes leveling"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "city university", "affiliation_string": "dublin city university", "city": "london", "Name": "gareth j f jones"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/1838745.1838746", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "donna harman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81406592091"}, {"name": "noriko kando", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100253509"}, {"name": "prasenjit majumder", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350598757"}, {"name": "mandar mitra", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81341494124"}, {"name": "carol peters", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100523414"}], "title": "Introduction to the Special Issue on Indian Language Information Retrieval Part I", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "20\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "266\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of standards and technology", "city": null, "Name": "donna harman"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "noriko kando"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "prasenjit majumderdhirubhai ambani institute of information and communication technology"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "mandar mitraindian statistical institute"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "carol peters"}]}}, "date": {"month": "September", "year": "2010"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 6": {"references": ["F.

From a theoretical perspective, we study 16 Chinese punctuation marks as defined in the Chinese national standard of punctuation usage, and categorize these punctuation marks into three different types according to their syntactic properties. We implement a three-tier maximum entropy model incorporating linguistically-motivated features for generating the commonly used Chinese punctuation marks in unpunctuated sentences output by a surface realizer. Furthermore, we present a method to automatically extract cue words indicating sentence-final punctuation marks as a specialized feature to construct a more precise model. Evaluating on the Penn Chinese Treebank data, the MaxEnt model achieves anf-score of 79.83&percnt; for punctuation insertion and 74.61&percnt; for punctuation restoration using gold data input, 79.50&percnt; for insertion and 73.32&percnt; for restoration using parser-based imperfect input. The experiments show that the MaxEnt model significantly outperforms a baseline 5-gram language model that scores 54.99&percnt; for punctuation insertion and 52.01&percnt; for restoration. We show that our results are not far from human performance on the same task with human insertionf-scores in the range of 81-87&percnt; and human restoration in the range of 71-82&percnt;.

LM helps acoustic models find the corresponding word sequence of a given speech signal. Without it, ASR systems would not understand the language and it would be hard to find the correct word sequence. During the past few years, researchers have tried to incorporate long-range dependencies into statistical word-basedn-gram LMs. One of these long-range dependencies is topic. Unlike words, topic is unobservable. Thus, it is required to find the meanings behind the words to get into the topic. This research is based on the belief that nouns contain topic information. We propose a new approach for a topic-dependent LM, where the topic is decided in an unsupervised manner. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is employed to reveal hidden (latent) relations among nouns in the context words. To decide the topic of an event, a fixed size word history sequence (window) is observed, and voting is then carried out based on noun class occurrences weighted by a confidence measure. Experiments were conducted on an English corpus and a Japanese corpus:The Wall Street Journalcorpus andMainichi Shimbun(Japanese newspaper) corpus. The results show that our proposed method gives better perplexity than the comparative baselines, including a word-based/class-basedn-gram LM, their interpolated LM, a cache-based LM, a topic-dependent LM based onn-gram, and a topic-dependent LM based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Then-best list rescoring was conducted to validate its application in ASR systems.", "authors": [{"name": "welly naptali", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413605596"}, {"name": "masatoshi tsuchiya", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100393536"}, {"name": "seiichi nakagawa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100433263"}], "title": "Topic-Dependent Language Model with Voting on Noun History", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "20\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "287\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "japan", "university": "toyohashi university of technology", "affiliation_string": "toyohashi university of technology", "city": "toyohashi", "Name": "welly naptali"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "toyohashi university of technology", "affiliation_string": "toyohashi university of technology", "city": "toyohashi", "Name": "masatoshi tsuchiya"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "toyohashi university of technology", "affiliation_string": "toyohashi university of technology", "city": "toyohashi", "Name": "seiichi nakagawa"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Masayuki Asahara , Chooi Ling Goh , Xiaojie Wang , Yuji Matsumoto, Combining segmenter and chunker for Chinese word segmentation, Proceedings of the second SIGHAN workshop on Chinese language processing, p.144-147, July 11-12, 2003, Sapporo, Japan[doi>10.3115/1119250.1119270]\n", "Eric Brill, Transformation-based error-driven learning and natural language processing: a case study in part-of-speech tagging, Computational Linguistics, v.21 n.4, p.543-565, December 1995\n", "Aitao Chen, Chinese word segmentation using minimal linguistic knowledge, Proceedings of the second SIGHAN workshop on Chinese language processing, p.148-151, July 11-12, 2003, Sapporo, Japan[doi>10.3115/1119250.1119271]\n", "Trevor Cohn , Andrew Smith , Miles Osborne, Scaling conditional random fields using error-correcting codes, Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics, p.10-17, June 25-30, 2005, Ann Arbor, Michigan[doi>10.3115/1219840.1219842]\n", "Emerson, T.2005.

Based on corpus-based segmentation standard, we launched this study. In detail, we regard Chinese word segmentation as a character-based tagging problem. We show that there has been a potent trend of using a character-based tagging approach in this field. In particular, learning from segmented corpus with or without additional linguistic resources is treated in a unified way in which the only difference depends on how the feature template set is selected. It differs from existing work in that both feature template selection and tag set selection are considered in our approach, instead of the previous feature template focus only technique. We show that there is a significant performance difference as different tag sets are selected. This is especially applied to a six-tag set, which is good enough for most current segmented corpora. The linguistic meaning of a tag set is also discussed. Our results show that a simple learning system with sixn-gram feature templates and a six-tag set can obtain competitive performance in the cases of learning only from a training corpus. In cases when additional linguistic resources are available, an ensemble learning technique, assistant segmenter, is proposed and its effectiveness is verified. Assistant segmenter is also proven to be an effective method as segmentation standard adaptation that outperforms existing ones. Based on the proposed approach, our system provides state-of-the-art performance in all 12 corpora of three international Chinese word segmentation bakeoffs.", "authors": [{"name": "hai zhao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418598197"}, {"name": "chang-ning huang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309511671"}, {"name": "mu li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81423594290"}, {"name": "bao-liang lu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100052708"}], "title": "A Unified Character-Based Tagging Framework for Chinese Word Segmentation", "citations": [{"Name": "Yunming Ye ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Qingyao Wu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yan Li ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "K.

(2) Q-measure, which can handle multiple correct answers and answer correctness levels, is at least as stable and sensitive as reciprocal rank, provided that amildgain value assignment is used. Emphasizing answer correctness levels tends to hurt stability and sensitivity, while handling multiple correct answers improves them.

Two sets of probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) are derived from a Chinese Treebank and a bilingual parallel corpus. In this approach, a three-stage translation model is proposed. First, the input Chinese sentence is parsed into possible phrase structure trees (PSTs) based on the Chinese PCFGs. Second, the Chinese PSTs are then transferred into TSL PSTs according to the transfer probabilities between the context-free grammar (CFG) rules of Chinese and TSL derived from the bilingual parallel corpus. Finally, the TSL PSTs are used to generate the possible translation results. The Viterbi algorithm is adopted to obtain the best translation result via the three-stage translation. For evaluation, three objective evaluation metrics including AER, Top-N, and BLUE and one subjective evaluation metric using MOS were used. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the IBM Model 3 in the task of Chinese to sign-language translation.", "authors": [{"name": "chung-hsien wu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350591456"}, {"name": "hung-yu su", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81321498564"}, {"name": "yu-hsien chiu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100341626"}, {"name": "chia-hung lin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81537089656"}], "title": "Transfer-based statistical translation of Taiwanese sign language using PCFG", "citations": [{"Name": "Sara Morrissey ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andy Way", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "14\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "412\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "taiwan", "university": "national cheng kung university", "affiliation_string": "national cheng kung university taiwan", "city": "tainan", "Name": "chung-hsien wu"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "national cheng kung university", "affiliation_string": "national cheng kung university taiwan", "city": "tainan", "Name": "hung-yu su"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "industrial technology research institute taiwan", "city": null, "Name": "yu-hsien chiu"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "national cheng kung university", "affiliation_string": "national cheng kung university taiwan", "city": "tainan", "Name": "chia-hung lin"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["R.

This can be less critical in languages like English where most of the sequences are illegal according to the grammatical rules of the language, for example, zx, bv or qe; hence the morphology can add a little information that can be beneficial for the compression algorithm. However, this negligence can be a significant flaw in languages like Hebrew where the grammatical rules allow much more freedom in the sequences of letters and, except tet after gimel, any pair is legal; hence compressing without taking the morphological rules into account can yield a poorer compression ratio. This article suggests a tool that optimizes the Burrows-Wheeler algorithm which is an unaware morphological rules compression method. It first preprocesses a Hebrew text file according to the Hebrew conjugation rules, and, after that, it provides the Burrows-Wheeler algorithm with this preprocessed file so that can be compressed better.

With many different translators working without a common standard, there may be many different Chinese transliterations for the same proper noun, such as using the same sounds but different Chinese characters or even using different sounds and characters. This causes confusion for the reader and, more importantly, leads to incomplete Chinese Web search results. This article investigates the similarity comparison of transliterations as a first step toward solving the incomplete search problem. We devise a method based on comparing digitalized Chinese character (or Hanzi) sounds. Along with four other methods based on comparing grapheme or phoneme similarity, we compare their performance of identifying synonymous transliterations against noise words taken from Web pages. Experimental results indicate that our method surpasses the other methods due to its advantage of containing more discriminative information in sound vectors. The method performing the second best is based on a scheme which assigns similarity between phonemes by carefully considering articulatory features of phonemes, including using multivalued features and placing different weights on the features. Among six pinyin schemes used to romanize Chinese transliterations, the Tongyong scheme outperforms the others.", "authors": [{"name": "chung-chian hsu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309508228"}, {"name": "chien-hsing chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409596395"}, {"name": "tien-teng shih", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81327491482"}, {"name": "chun-kai chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409596371"}], "title": "Measuring similarity between transliterations against noise data", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "10\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "396\n", "Citation Count": "4\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "taiwan", "university": "national yunlin university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "national yunlin university of science and technology taiwan ro c", "city": "douliu", "Name": "chung-chian hsu"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "national yunlin university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "national yunlin university of science and technology taiwan ro c", "city": "douliu", "Name": "chien-hsing chen"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "national yunlin university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "national yunlin university of science and technology taiwan ro c", "city": "douliu", "Name": "tien-teng shih"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "national yunlin university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "national yunlin university of science and technology taiwan ro c", "city": "douliu", "Name": "chun-kai chen"}]}}, "date": {"month": "April", "year": "2007"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Akaike, H. 1980.

It aims to alleviate the main problems encountered in processing of Tamil language, like enormous vocabulary growth caused by the large number of different forms derived from one word. The size of the vocabulary was reduced by, decomposing the words into stems and endings and storing these sub word units (morphemes) in the vocabulary separately. A enhanced morpheme-based language model was designed for the inflectional language Tamil. The enhanced morpheme-based language model was trained on the decomposed corpus. The perplexity and Word Error Rate (WER) were obtained to check the efficiency of the model for Tamil speech recognition system. The results were compared with word-based bigram and trigram language models, distance based language model, dependency based language model and class based language model. From the results it was analyzed that the enhanced morpheme-based trigram model with Katz back-off smoothing effect improved the performance of the Tamil speech recognition system when compared to the word-based language models.", "authors": [{"name": "s saraswathi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81467645248"}, {"name": "t v geetha", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100016860"}], "title": "Comparison of performance of enhanced morpheme-based language model with different word-based language models for improving the performance of Tamil speech recognition system", "citations": [{"Name": "R.

Specifically, we use the approximate minimal bounding sphere of a query character and utilize users' relevance feedback to refine the query gradually. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to testify the efficiency and effectiveness of this method. In addition, a newk-NN search called Pseudok-NN (Pk-NN) search is presented to better facilitate the PDM-based character retrieval.", "authors": [{"name": "yl zhuang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81344501156"}, {"name": "yueting zhuang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314487385"}, {"name": "qing li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81324491114"}, {"name": "lei chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350582990"}], "title": "Interactive high-dimensional index for large Chinese calligraphic character databases", "citations": [{"Name": "Yi Zhuang", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Edgar Roman-Rangel ", "Country": "oman", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Carlos Pallan Gayol ", "Country": "oman", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jean-Marc Odobez ", "Country": "oman", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daniel Gatica-Perez", "Country": "oman", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yi Zhuang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Qing Li ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dickson K.

In this approach, we formulate the machine transliteration process using a syllable-based phonetic similarity model which consists of phonetic confusion matrices and a Chinese charactern-gram language model. With the phonetic similarity model, the extraction of transliteration pairs becomes a two-step process ofrecognition followed by validation:First, in therecognitionprocess, we identify the most probable transliteration in thek-neighborhood of a recognized English word. Then, in thevalidationprocess, we qualify the transliteration pair candidates with a hypothesis test. We carry out an analytical study on the statistics of several key factors in English-Chinese transliteration to help formulate phonetic similarity modeling. We then conduct both supervised and unsupervised learning of a phonetic similarity model on a development database. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the phonetic similarity model by achieving anF-measure of 0.739 in supervised learning. The unsupervised learning approach works almost as well as the supervised one, thus allowing us to deploy automatic extraction of transliteration pairs in the Web space.", "authors": [{"name": "jin-shea kuo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323492065"}, {"name": "haizhou li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100479983"}, {"name": "ying-kuei yang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323497662"}], "title": "A phonetic similarity model for automatic extraction of transliteration pairs", "citations": [{"Name": "Vladimir Pervouchine ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Min Zhang ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ming Liu ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Haizhou Li", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Improving name origin recognition with context features and unlabelled data", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xue Jiang ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Le Sun ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dakun Zhang", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "A syllable-based name transliteration system", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Vladimir Pervouchine ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Haizhou Li ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bo Lin", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Transliteration alignment", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ali El Kahki ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kareem Darwish ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ahmed Saad El Din ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mohamed Abd El-Wahab", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Transliteration mining using large training and test sets", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "20\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "590\n", "Citation Count": "11\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "taiwan", "university": "national taiwan university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "national taiwan university of science and technology taipei taiwan", "city": "taibei", "Name": "jin-shea kuo"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "institute for infocomm research singapore", "city": null, "Name": "haizhou li"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "national taiwan university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "national taiwan university of science and technology taiwan", "city": "taibei", "Name": "ying-kuei yang"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Issam Bazzi , Richard Schwartz , John Makhoul, An Omnifont Open-Vocabulary OCR System for English and Arabic, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, v.21 n.6, p.495-504, June 1999[doi>10.1109/34.771314]\n", "Peter F.

Several related issues are discussed in detail, including the representation of positional information, NS-MEMM implementation, smoothing techniques, and the space complexity issue. Furthermore, the asymmetric NS-MEMM presents a more flexible way to exploit positional information. In the experiments, NS-MEMM is evaluated on both the Chinese and the English pos-tagging tasks. According to the experimental results, NS-MEMM yields effective improvements over MEMM by exploiting positional information.

Since the Chinese characters in Japanese originated from ancient China, many common Chinese characters exist between these two languages. Since Chinese characters contain significant semantic information and common Chinese characters share the same meaning in the two languages, they can be quite useful in Chinese-Japanese machine translation (MT). We therefore propose a method for creating a Chinese character mapping table for Japanese, traditional Chinese, and simplified Chinese, with the aim of constructing a complete resource of common Chinese characters. Furthermore, we point out two main problems in Chinese word segmentation for Chinese-Japanese MT, namely, unknown words and word segmentation granularity, and propose an approach exploiting common Chinese characters to solve these problems. We also propose a statistical method for detecting other semantically equivalent Chinese characters other than the common ones and a method for exploiting shared Chinese characters in phrase alignment. Results of the experiments carried out on a state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical MT system and an example-based MT system show that our proposed approaches can improve MT performance significantly, thereby verifying the effectiveness of shared Chinese characters for Chinese-Japanese MT.", "authors": [{"name": "chenhui chu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83358850457"}, {"name": "toshiaki nakazawa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81443592405"}, {"name": "daisuke kawahara", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100310549"}, {"name": "sadao kurohashi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100374659"}], "title": "Chinese-Japanese Machine Translation Exploiting Chinese Characters", "citations": [{"Name": "Chenhui Chu ", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Toshiaki Nakazawa ", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sadao Kurohashi", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "55\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "189\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "japan", "university": "kyoto university", "affiliation_string": "kyoto university", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "chenhui chu"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "kyoto university", "affiliation_string": "kyoto university", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "toshiaki nakazawa"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "kyoto university", "affiliation_string": "kyoto university", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "daisuke kawahara"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "kyoto university", "affiliation_string": "kyoto university", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "sadao kurohashi"}]}, "Article No.: 15": {"references": ["Joshua S.

In our approach, predictions are offered on the fly to help the user make appropriate lexical and grammar choices during the translation of a source text, thus improving translation quality and productivity. The method involves automatically generating general-to-specific word usage summaries (i.e., writing suggestion module), and automatically learning high-confidence word- or phrase-level translation equivalents (i.e., translation suggestion module). At runtime, the source text and its translation prefix entered by the user are broken down into n-grams to generate grammar and translation predictions, which are further combined and ranked via translation and language models. These ranked prediction candidates are iteratively and interactively displayed to the user in a pop-up menu as translation or writing hints. We present a prototype writing assistant,TransAhead, that applies the method to a human-computer collaborative environment. Automatic and human evaluations show that novice translators or language learners substantially benefit from our system in terms of translation performance (i.e., translation accuracy and productivity) and language learning (i.e., collocation usage and grammar). In general, our methodology of inline grammar and text predictions or suggestions has great potential in the field of computer-assisted translation, writing, or even language learning.", "authors": [{"name": "chung-chi huang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81392608345"}, {"name": "mei-hua chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548545656"}, {"name": "ping-che yang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81501667033"}, {"name": "jason s chang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548386556"}], "title": "A Computer-Assisted Translation and Writing System", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "43\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "202\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national tsing hua university", "city": null, "Name": "chung-chi huang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national tsing hua university", "city": null, "Name": "mei-hua chen"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "ping-che yang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "mei-hua chen", "city": null, "Name": "jason s changnational tsing hua university"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Bogdan Babych, Anthony Hartley, and Serge Sharoff. 2005.

A previously proposed post-ordering method for Japanese-to-English translation first translates a Japanese sentence into a sequence of English words in a word order similar to that of Japanese, then reorders the sequence into an English word order. We employed this post-ordering framework and improved upon its reordering method. The existing post-ordering method reorders the sequence of English words via SMT, whereas our method reorders the sequence by (1) parsing the sequence using ITG to obtain syntactic structures which are similar to Japanese syntactic structures, and (2) transferring the obtained syntactic structures into English syntactic structures according to the ITG. The experiments using Japanese-to-English patent translation demonstrated the effectiveness of our method and showed that both the RIBES and BLEU scores were improved over compared methods.", "authors": [{"name": "isao goto", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323490532"}, {"name": "masao utiyama", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100491189"}, {"name": "eiichiro sumita", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81328490654"}], "title": "Post-Ordering by Parsing with ITG for Japanese-English Statistical Machine Translation", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "33\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "142\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "japan", "university": "kyoto university", "affiliation_string": "national institute of information and communications technology and kyoto university", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "isao goto"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of information and communications technology", "city": null, "Name": "masao utiyama"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of information and communications technology", "city": null, "Name": "eiichiro sumita"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["Bj\u00f6rn Brembs, Katherine Button, and Marcus Munaf\u00f3. 2013.

Recognizing logical structures in legal texts does not only help people in understanding legal documents, but also in supporting other tasks in legal text processing.In this article, we present a new task, learning logical structures of paragraphs in legal articles, which is studied in research on Legal Engineering. The goals of this task are recognizing logical parts of law sentences in a paragraph, and then grouping related logical parts into some logical structures of formulas, which describe logical relations between logical parts. We present a two-phase framework to learn logical structures of paragraphs in legal articles. In the first phase, we model the problem of recognizing logical parts in law sentences as a multi-layer sequence learning problem, and present a CRF-based model to recognize them. In the second phase, we propose a graph-based method to group logical parts into logical structures. We consider the problem of finding a subset of complete subgraphs in a weighted-edge complete graph, where each node corresponds to a logical part, and a complete subgraph corresponds to a logical structure. We also present an integer linear programming formulation for this optimization problem. Our models achieve 74.37&percnt; in recognizing logical parts, 80.08&percnt; in recognizing logical structures, and 58.36&percnt; in the whole task on the Japanese National Pension Law corpus. Our work provides promising results for further research on this interesting task.", "authors": [{"name": "ngo xuan bach", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375614612"}, {"name": "nguyen le minh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548030383"}, {"name": "tran thi oanh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81553652056"}, {"name": "akira shimazu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100379238"}], "title": "A Two-Phase Framework for Learning Logical Structures of Paragraphs in Legal Articles", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "43\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "260\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "japan", "university": "japan advanced institute of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "japan advanced institute of science and technology", "city": "ishikawa", "Name": "ngo xuan bach"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "japan advanced institute of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "japan advanced institute of science and technology", "city": "ishikawa", "Name": "nguyen le minh"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "japan advanced institute of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "japan advanced institute of science and technology", "city": "ishikawa", "Name": "tran thi oanh"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "japan advanced institute of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "japan advanced institute of science and technology", "city": "ishikawa", "Name": "akira shimazu"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["Agrawal, R. and Srikant, R. 1994.

Our proposed segmentation strategy comprises two modules, namely the (1) Dominant Overlap Criterion Segmentation (DOCS) module and (2) Attention Feedback Segmentation (AFS) module. Based on a bounding box overlap criterion in the DOCS module, the input word is first segmented into stroke groups. A stroke group may at times correspond to a part of a valid symbol (over-segmentation) or a merger of valid symbols (under-segmentation). Attention on specific features in the AFS module serve in detecting possibly over-segmented or under-segmented stroke groups. Thereafter, feedbacks from the SVM classifier likelihoods and stroke-group based features are considered in modifying the suspected stroke groups to form valid symbols.The proposed scheme is tested on a set of 10000 isolated handwritten words (containing 53,246 Tamil symbols). The results show that the DOCS module achieves a symbol-level segmentation accuracy of 98.1&percnt;, which improves to as high as 99.7&percnt; after the AFS strategy. This in turn entails a symbol recognition rate of 83.9&percnt; (at the DOCS module) and 88.4&percnt; (after the AFS module). The resulting word recognition rates at the DOCS and AFS modules are found to be, 50.9&percnt; and 64.9&percnt; respectively, without any postprocessing.", "authors": [{"name": "suresh sundaram", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435602003"}, {"name": "a g ramakrishnan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100289138"}], "title": "Attention-Feedback Based Robust Segmentation of Online Handwritten Isolated Tamil Words", "citations": [{"Name": "A.

There are usually two stages in a CPIM: 1. segment the syllable sequence into syllable words, and 2. select the most likely character words for each syllable word. A CPIM usually assumes that the input is a complete sentence, and evaluates the performance based on a well-formed corpus. However, in practice, most Pinyin users prefer progressive text entry in several short chunks, mainly in one or two words each (most Chinese words consist of two or more characters). Short chunks do not provide enough contexts to perform the best possible syllable-to-character conversion, especially when a chunk consists of overlapping syllable words. In such cases, a conversion system often selects the boundary of a word with the highest frequency. Short chunk input is even more popular on platforms with limited computing power, such as mobile phones. Based on the observation that the relative strength of a word can be quite different when calculated leftwards or rightwards, we propose a simple division of the word context into the left context and the right context. Furthermore, we design a double ranking strategy for each word to reduce the number of errors in Step 1. Our strategy is modeled as the minimum feedback arc set problem on bipartite tournament with approximate solutions derived from genetic algorithm. Experiments show that, compared to the frequency-based method (FBM) (low memory and fast) and the conditional random fields (CRF) model (larger memory and slower), our double ranking strategy has the benefits of less memory and low power requirement with competitive performance. We believe a similar strategy could also be adopted to disambiguate conflicting linguistic patterns effectively.", "authors": [{"name": "mike tian-jian jiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81496658028"}, {"name": "tsung-hsien lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81542653956"}, {"name": "wen-lian hsu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81553477256"}], "title": "The Left and Right Context of a Word: Overlapping Chinese Syllable Word Segmentation with Minimal Context", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "36\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "175\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national tsing hua university and academia sinica", "city": null, "Name": "mike tian-jian jiang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "academia sinica and university of texas at austin", "city": null, "Name": "tsung-hsien lee"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "academia sinica and national tsing hua university", "city": null, "Name": "wen-lian hsu"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2013"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Adger, D. 2003.Core Syntax: A Minimalist Approach.Oxford University Press, Oxford UK.\n", "Caroline Brun , Caroline Hag\u00e8ge, Normalization and paraphrasing using symbolic methods, Proceedings of the second international workshop on Paraphrasing, p.41-48, July 11-11, 2003, Sapporo, Japan[doi>10.3115/1118984.1118990]\n", "Gennaro Chierchia , Sally McConnell-Ginet, Meaning and grammar (2nd ed.): an introduction to semantics, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 2000\n", "Cinque, G. 2006.Restructuring and Functional Heads: The Cartography of Syntactic Structures.Vol. 4.

In order to accomplish this, extracting the semantic information of functional expressions plays a crucial role, because functional expressions such aswould like toandcan\u2019tare key expressions to detecting customers\u2019 needs and wants. However, in Japanese, functional expressions appear in the form of suffixes, and two different types of functional expressions are merged into one predicate: one influences the factual meaning of the predicate while the other is merely used for discourse purposes. This triggers an increase in surface forms, which hinders information extraction systems. In this article, we present a novel normalization technique that paraphrases complex functional expressions into simplified forms that retain only the crucial meaning of the predicate. We construct paraphrasing rules based on linguistic theories in syntax and semantics. The results of experiments indicate that our system achieves a high accuracy of 79.7&percnt;, while it reduces the differences in functional expressions by up to 66.7&percnt;. The results also show an improvement in the performance of predicate extraction, providing encouraging evidence of the usability of paraphrasing as a means of normalizing different language expressions.", "authors": [{"name": "tomoko izumi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81448593564"}, {"name": "kenji imamura", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81328488871"}, {"name": "taichi asami", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82658785457"}, {"name": "kuniko saito", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82658770257"}, {"name": "genichiro kikui", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82658801157"}, {"name": "satoshi sato", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82658737957"}], "title": "Normalizing Complex Functional Expressions in Japanese Predicates: Linguistically-Directed Rule-Based Paraphrasing and Its Application", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "24\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "122\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ntt media intelligence laboratories ntt corporation", "city": null, "Name": "tomoko izumi"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ntt media intelligence laboratories ntt corporation", "city": null, "Name": "kenji imamura"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ntt media intelligence laboratories ntt corporation", "city": null, "Name": "taichi asami"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ntt media intelligence laboratories ntt corporation", "city": null, "Name": "kuniko saito"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ntt corporation", "city": null, "Name": "genichiro kikui"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "nagoya university", "affiliation_string": "nagoya university", "city": "nagoya", "Name": "satoshi sato"}]}, "Article No.: 8": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2499955.2499956", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "richard sproat", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100642988"}], "title": "EDITORIAL Greetings from the new Editor-in-Chief", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "11\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "84\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": []}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Masayuki Asahara , Yuji Matsumoto, Japanese Named Entity extraction with redundant morphological analysis, Proceedings of the 2003 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics on Human Language Technology, p.8-15, May 27-June 01, 2003, Edmonton, Canada[doi>10.3115/1073445.1073447]\n", "Eric Brill, Transformation-based error-driven learning and natural language processing: a case study in part-of-speech tagging, Computational Linguistics, v.21 n.4, p.543-565, December 1995\n", "Xavier Carreras , Llu\u00eds M\u00e0rquez , Llu\u00eds Padr\u00f3, Named Entity Extraction using AdaBoost, proceedings of the 6th conference on Natural language learning, p.1-4, August 31, 2002[doi>10.3115/1118853.1118857]\n", "William W.

Our method identifies word chunks with a base chunker, such as a noun phrase chunker, and then recognizes NEs from the recognized word chunk sequences. By using word chunks, we can obtain features that cannot be obtained in word-sequence-based recognition methods, such as the first word of a word chunk, the last word of a word chunk, and so on. However, each word chunk may include a part of an NE or multiple NEs. To solve this problem, we use the following operators: SHIFT for separating the first word from a word chunk, POP for separating the last word from a word chunk, JOIN for concatenating two word chunks, and REDUCE for assigning an NE label to a word chunk. We evaluate our method on a Japanese NE recognition dataset that includes about 200,000 annotations of 191 types of NEs from over 8,500 news articles.

This reordering problem, calledpost-ordering, is solved as an SMT problem from Head-Final English (HFE) to English. HFE is syntax-based reordered English that is very successfully used for reordering with English-to-Japanese SMT. The proposed method incorporates its advantage into the reverse direction, Japanese-to-English, and solves the post-ordering problem by accurate syntax-based SMT with target language syntax. Two-step SMT with the proposed post-ordering empirically reduces the decoding time of the accurate but slow syntax-based SMT by its good approximation using intermediate HFE. The proposed method improves the decoding speed of syntax-based SMT decoding by about six times with comparable translation accuracy in Japanese-to-English patent translation experiments.", "authors": [{"name": "katsuhito sudoh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323496503"}, {"name": "xianchao wu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548956656"}, {"name": "kevin duh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323489590"}, {"name": "hajime tsukada", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548005167"}, {"name": "masaaki nagata", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100522615"}], "title": "Syntax-Based Post-Ordering for Efficient Japanese-to-English Translation", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "49\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "191\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ntt communication science laboratories", "city": null, "Name": "katsuhito sudoh"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ntt communication science laboratories", "city": null, "Name": "xianchao wu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ntt communication science laboratories", "city": null, "Name": "kevin duh"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ntt communication science laboratories", "city": null, "Name": "hajime tsukada"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ntt communication science laboratories", "city": null, "Name": "masaaki nagata"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["Aldous, D.

We use a nonparametric Bayesian method for the alignment process, as this process rewards the reuse of parameters, resulting in compact models that align in a consistent manner and tend not to over-fit. Our approach uses the generative model resulting from aligning the training data to force-align the test data. We rely on the simple assumption that correct transliteration pairs would be well modeled and generated easily, whereas incorrect pairs---being more random in character---would be more costly to model and generate. Our generative model generates by concatenating bilingual grapheme sequence pairs. The many-to-many generation process is essential for handling many languages with non-Roman scripts, and it is hard to train well using a maximum likelihood techniques, as these tend to over-fit the data. Our approach works on the principle that generation using only grapheme sequence pairs that are in the model results in a high probability derivation, whereas if the model is forced to introduce a new parameter in order to explain part of the candidate pair, the derivation probability is substantially reduced and severely reduced if the new parameter corresponds to a sequence pair composed of a large number of graphemes. The features we extract from the alignment of the test data are not only based on the scores from the generative model, but also on the relative proportions of each sequence that are hard to generate. The features are used in conjunction with a support vector machine classifier trained on known positive examples together with synthetic negative examples to determine whether a candidate word pair is a correct transliteration pair. In our experiments, we used all data tracks from the 2010 Named-Entity Workshop (NEWS\u201910) and use the performance of the best system for each language pair as a reference point. Our results show that the new features we propose are powerfully predictive, enabling our approach to achieve levels of performance on this task that are comparable to the state of the art.", "authors": [{"name": "takaaki fukunishi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82659083357"}, {"name": "andrew finch", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100186839"}, {"name": "seiichi yamamoto", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82658713357"}, {"name": "eiichiro sumita", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502766558"}], "title": "A Bayesian Alignment Approach to Transliteration Mining", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "17\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "144\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "japan", "university": "doshisha university", "affiliation_string": "doshisha university", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "takaaki fukunishi"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "andrew finch"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "andrew finch", "city": null, "Name": "seiichi yamamotodoshisha university"}]}}, "date": {"month": "August", "year": "2013"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 6": {"references": ["David Ahlstr\u00f6m , Andy Cockburn , Carl Gutwin , Pourang Irani, Why it's quick to be square: modelling new and existing hierarchical menu designs, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 10-15, 2010, Atlanta, Georgia, USA[doi>10.1145/1753326.1753534]\n", "Baker, P., Hardie, A., Mcenery, T., and Jayaram, B. 2003.

These languages have poor or no support for typing. Soft keyboards, because of their ease of installation and lack of reliance on specific hardware, are a promising solution as an input device for many languages. Developing an acceptable soft keyboard requires the frequency analysis of characters in order to design a layout that minimizes text-input time. This article proposes the use of various development techniques, layout variations, and evaluation methods for the creation of soft keyboards for Brahmic scripts. We propose that using optimization techniques such as genetic algorithms and multi-objective Pareto optimization to develop multi-layer keyboards will increase the speed at which text can be entered.", "authors": [{"name": "lauren hinkle", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81758909357"}, {"name": "albert brouillette", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81758751457"}, {"name": "sujay jayakar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81758991557"}, {"name": "leigh gathings", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81758658357"}, {"name": "miguel lezcano", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81758714657"}, {"name": "jugal kalita", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100288385"}], "title": "Design and Evaluation of Soft Keyboards for Brahmic Scripts", "citations": [{"Name": "Sanjay Ghosh ", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Anirudha Joshi", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "37\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "222\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of michigan", "city": null, "Name": "lauren hinkle"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado", "city": null, "Name": "albert brouillette"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cornell university", "city": null, "Name": "sujay jayakar"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "mitre corporation", "city": null, "Name": "leigh gathings"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado", "city": null, "Name": "miguel lezcano"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado", "city": null, "Name": "jugal kalita"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Eneko Agirre , David Mart\u00ednez, Exploring automatic word sense disambiguation with decision lists and the web, Proceedings of the COLING-2000 Workshop on Semantic Annotation and Intelligent Content, August 01, 2000, Luxembourg\n", "Agirre, E. and Martinez, D. 2004.

Next, in Step 2, we apply a semi-supervised classifier and achieve an improvement using easy-to-get unlabeled data. In this step, we also show that we can guess even unseen senses.We target a SemEval-2010 Japanese WSD task, which is a lexical sample task. Both Step 1 and Step 2 methods performed better than the best published result (76.4 &percnt;). Furthermore, the combined method achieved much higher accuracy (84.2 &percnt;). In this experiment, up to 50 &percnt; of unseen senses are classified correctly. However, the number of unseen senses are small, therefore, we delete one senses per word and apply our proposed method; the results show that the method is effective and robust even for unseen senses.", "authors": [{"name": "sanae fujita", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81758966157"}, {"name": "akinori fujino", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350574692"}], "title": "Word Sense Disambiguation by Combining Labeled Data Expansion and Semi-Supervised Learning Method", "citations": [{"Name": "Amita Jain ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "D.

Although the two approaches compete with one another, we find they are also highly complementary. We propose a combination of the two approaches, and we will show the proposed method outperforms all of the existing methods on abbreviation generation datasets.

The pronunciation variants prediction method was developed by generalized transformation-based error-driven learning (GTBL). The modified goodness of pronunciation (GOP) score was applied to effective mispronunciation detection using logistic regression machine learning under the pronunciation variants prediction. English-read speech data uttered by Korean-speaking learners of English were collected, then pronunciation variation knowledge was extracted from the differences between the canonical phonemes and the actual phonemes of the speech data. With this knowledge, an error-driven learning approach was designed that automatically learns phoneme variation rules from phoneme-level transcriptions. The learned rules generate an extended recognition network to detect mispronunciations. Three different mispronunciation detection methods were tested including our logistic regression machine learning method with modified GOP scores and mispronunciation preference features; all three methods yielded significant improvement in predictions of pronunciation variants, and our logistic regression method showed the best performance.", "authors": [{"name": "jeesoo bang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658668094"}, {"name": "jonghoon lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442599462"}, {"name": "gary geunbae lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87358814157"}, {"name": "minhwa chung", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548036067"}], "title": "Pronunciation Variants Prediction Method to Detect Mispronunciations by Korean Learners of English", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "117\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "11\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "161\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "pohang university of science and technology", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "jeesoo bang"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "pohang university of science and technology", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "jonghoon lee"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "pohang university of science and technology", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "gary geunbae lee"}, {"country": "philippines", "university": "national university", "affiliation_string": "seoul national university", "city": "manila", "Name": "minhwa chung"}]}, "Article No.: 18": {"references": ["Bill Allcock , Joe Bester , John Bresnahan , Ann L.

However, these methods suffer from two problems due to the diversity and uneven distribution of source sentences. First, their performance is highly dependent on the choice of a development set, which may lead to an unstable performance for testing. Second, the sentence level translation quality is not assured since tuning is performed on the document level rather than on sentence level. In contrast with the standard global training in which a single weight is learned, we propose novel local training methods to address these two problems. We perform training and testing in one step by locally learning the sentence-wise weight for each input sentence. Since the time of each tuning step is unnegligible and learning sentence-wise weights for the entire test set means many passes of tuning, it is a great challenge for the efficiency of local training. We propose an efficient two-phase method to put the local training into practice by employing the ultraconservative update. On NIST Chinese-to-English translation tasks with both medium and large scales of training data, our local training methods significantly outperform standard methods with the maximal improvements up to 2.0 BLEU points, meanwhile their efficiency is comparable to that of the standard methods.", "authors": [{"name": "lemao liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81549195756"}, {"name": "tiejun zhao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329493297"}, {"name": "taro watanabe", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81328490787"}, {"name": "hailong cao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81470651172"}, {"name": "conghui zhu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81472640862"}], "title": "Discriminative Training for Log-Linear Based SMT: Global or Local Methods", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "94\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "142\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "china", "university": "harbin institute of technology", "affiliation_string": "harbin institute of technology china", "city": "harbin", "Name": "lemao liu"}, {"country": "china", "university": "harbin institute of technology", "affiliation_string": "harbin institute of technology china", "city": "harbin", "Name": "tiejun zhao"}, {"country": "japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of information and communications technology japan", "city": null, "Name": "taro watanabe"}, {"country": "china", "university": "harbin institute of technology", "affiliation_string": "harbin institute of technology china", "city": "harbin", "Name": "hailong cao"}, {"country": "china", "university": "harbin institute of technology", "affiliation_string": "harbin institute of technology china", "city": "harbin", "Name": "conghui zhu"}]}}, "date": {"month": "December", "year": "2014"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Yaser Al-Onaizan , Kishore Papineni, Distortion models for statistical machine translation, Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Computational Linguistics and the 44th annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, p.529-536, July 17-18, 2006, Sydney, Australia[doi>10.3115/1220175.1220242]\n", "Adam L.

In decoding, a distortion model estimates the source word position to be translated next (subsequent position; SP) given the last translated source word position (current position; CP). We propose a distortion model that can simultaneously consider the word at the CP, the word at an SP candidate, the context of the CP and an SP candidate, relative word order among the SP candidates, and the words between the CP and an SP candidate. These considered elements are calledrich context. Our model considers rich context by discriminating label sequences that specify spans from the CP to each SP candidate. It enables our model to learn the effect of relative word order among SP candidates as well as to learn the effect of distances from the training data. In contrast to the learning strategy of existing methods, our learning strategy is that the model learns preference relations among SP candidates in each sentence of the training data. This leaning strategy enables consideration of all of the rich context simultaneously. In our experiments, our model had higher BLUE and RIBES scores for Japanese-English, Chinese-English, and German-English translation compared to the lexical reordering models.", "authors": [{"name": "isao goto", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323490532"}, {"name": "masao utiyama", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100491189"}, {"name": "eiichiro sumita", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81328490654"}, {"name": "akihiro tamura", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548464756"}, {"name": "sadao kurohashi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100374659"}], "title": "Distortion Model Based on Word Sequence Labeling for Statistical Machine Translation", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "86\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "283\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "japan", "university": "kyoto university", "affiliation_string": "national institute of information and communications technology and kyoto university", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "isao goto"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of information and communications technology", "city": null, "Name": "masao utiyama"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of information and communications technology", "city": null, "Name": "eiichiro sumita"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of information and communications technology", "city": null, "Name": "akihiro tamura"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "kyoto university", "affiliation_string": "kyoto university", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "sadao kurohashi"}]}, "Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Eugene Agichtein , Luis Gravano,Snowball: extracting relations from large plain-text collections, Proceedings of the fifth ACM conference on Digital libraries, p.85-94, June 02-07, 2000, San Antonio, Texas, USA[doi>10.1145/336597.336644]\n", "Michele Banko , Michael J.

The categorization algorithm was built by adopting a simple categorization idea then moving forward to more complex ones. We applied tests and filtration criteria to reach the best and most efficient results that our algorithm can achieve. The categorization depends on the statistical relations between the input (test) text and the reference (training) data supported by well-defined Wikipedia-based categories. Our algorithm supports two levels for categorizing Arabic text; categories are grouped into a hierarchy of main categories and subcategories. This introduces a challenge due to the correlation between certain subcategories and overlap between main categories. We argue that our algorithm achieved good performance compared to other methods reported in the literature.", "authors": [{"name": "adnan yahya", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100185359"}, {"name": "ali salhi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87358645957"}], "title": "Arabic Text Categorization Based on Arabic Wikipedia", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "49\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "189\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "palestine", "university": "birzeit university", "affiliation_string": "birzeit university", "city": "bir zayt", "Name": "adnan yahya"}, {"country": "palestine", "university": "birzeit university", "affiliation_string": "birzeit university", "city": "bir zayt", "Name": "ali salhi"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Kevin W.

In this study, we focus on the problem of stemming several resource-poor languages from Eastern India, viz., Assamese, Bengali, Bishnupriya Manipuri and Bodo. While Assamese, Bengali and Bishnupriya Manipuri are Indo-Aryan, Bodo is a Tibeto-Burman language. We design a rule-based approach to remove suffixes from words. To reduce over-stemming and under-stemming errors, we introduce a dictionary of frequent words. We observe that, for these languages a dominant amount of suffixes are single letters creating problems during suffix stripping. As a result, we introduce an HMM-based hybrid approach to classify the mis-matched last character. For each word, the stem is extracted by calculating the most probable path in four HMM states. At each step we measure the stemming accuracy for each language. We obtain 94&percnt; accuracy for Assamese and Bengali and 87&percnt;, and 82&percnt; for Bishnupriya Manipuri and Bodo, respectively, using the hybrid approach. We compare our work with Morfessor [Creutz and Lagus 2005]. As of now, there is no reported work on stemming for Bishnupriya Manipuri and Bodo. Our results on Assamese and Bengali show significant improvement over prior published work [Sarkar and Bandyopadhyay 2008; Sharma et al. 2002, 2003].", "authors": [{"name": "navanath saharia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81458647848"}, {"name": "utpal sharma", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81371591967"}, {"name": "jugal kalita", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100288385"}], "title": "Stemming resource-poor Indian languages", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "39\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "127\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "india", "university": "tezpur university", "affiliation_string": "tezpur university", "city": "tezpur", "Name": "navanath saharia"}, {"country": "india", "university": "tezpur university", "affiliation_string": "tezpur university", "city": "tezpur", "Name": "utpal sharma"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado colorado springs", "city": null, "Name": "jugal kalita"}]}, "Article No.: 12": {"references": ["V.

Existing word prediction systems predict a word when a user correctly enters the initial few characters of the word. In fact, a word prediction system fails if the user makes errors in the initial input. Therefore, there is a need to develop a word prediction system that predicts desired words while coping with errors in initial entries. This requirement is more relevant in the case of text entry in Indian languages, which are involved with a large set of alphabets, words with complex characters and inflections, phonetically similar sets of characters, etc. In fact, text composition in Indian languages involves frequent spelling errors, which presents a challenge to develop an efficient word prediction system. In this article, we address this problem and propose a novel word prediction system. Our proposed approach has been tried with Hindi, the national language of India. Experiments with users substantiate 43.77&percnt; keystroke savings, 92.49&percnt; hit rate, and 95.82&percnt; of prediction utilization with the proposed word prediction system.

Most previous stemmer results have reported on Malay Rumi characters and only a few have tested Jawi characters. In this article, a new Jawi stemmer has been proposed and tested for document retrieval. A total of 36 queries and datasets from the transliterated Jawi Quran were used. The experiment shows that the mean average precision for a \u201cstemmed Jawi\u201d document is 8.43&percnt;. At the same time, the mean average precision for a \u201cnonstemmed Jawi\u201d document is 5.14&percnt;. The result from a paired sample t-test showed that the use of a \u201cstemmed Jawi\u201d document increased the precision in document retrieval. Further experiments were performed to examine the precision of the relevant documents that were retrieved at various cutoff points for all 36 queries. The results for the \u201cstemmed Jawi\u201d document showed a significantly different start, at a cutoff of 40, compared with the \u201cnonstemmed Jawi\u201d documents. This result shows the usefulness of a Jawi stemmer for retrieving relevant documents in the Jawi script.", "authors": [{"name": "suliana sulaiman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81501669565"}, {"name": "khairuddin omar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330495813"}, {"name": "nazlia omar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350580498"}, {"name": "mohd zamri murah", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81501680889"}, {"name": "hamdan abdul rahman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=89758878857"}], "title": "The Effectiveness of a Jawi Stemmer for Retrieving Relevant Malay Documents in Jawi Characters", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "69\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "167\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "malaysia", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "sultan idris education university malaysia", "city": null, "Name": "suliana sulaiman"}, {"country": "malaysia", "university": "universiti kebangsaan malaysia", "affiliation_string": "universiti kebangsaan malaysia", "city": "kangar", "Name": "khairuddin omar"}, {"country": "malaysia", "university": "universiti kebangsaan malaysia", "affiliation_string": "universiti kebangsaan malaysia", "city": "kangar", "Name": "nazlia omar"}, {"country": "malaysia", "university": "universiti kebangsaan malaysia", "affiliation_string": "universiti kebangsaan malaysia", "city": "kangar", "Name": "mohd zamri murah"}, {"country": "malaysia", "university": "universiti kebangsaan malaysia", "affiliation_string": "universiti kebangsaan malaysia", "city": "kangar", "Name": "hamdan abdul rahman"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["Abdul-Mageed, M., and Diab, M. 2012.

Then, we propose a multiclass supervised learning approach that predicts nested units. Our approach uses a combination of punctuation, morphological, lexical, and shallow syntactic features. We investigate how each feature contributes to the learning process. We show that an extensive morphological analysis is crucial to achieve good results in both corpora.

Internet standard RFC 3490, referred to as IDNA (Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications), focuses on access to IDNs (Internationalized Domain Names) in a range of scripts that is broader in scope than the original ASCII. However, the use of character variants that have similar appearances and/or interpretations could create confusion. A variant IDL (Internationalized Domain Label), derived from an IDL by replacing some characters with their variants, should match the original IDL; and thus a variant IDN does. In RFC 3743, referred to as JET (Joint Engineering Team) Guidelines, it is suggested that zone administrators model this concept of equivalence as an atomic IDL package. When an IDL is registered, an IDL package is created that contains its variant IDLs generated according to the zone-specific Language Variant Tables (LVTs). In addition to the registered IDL, the name holder can request the domain registry to activate some of the variant IDLs, free or by an extra fee. The activated variant IDLs are stored in the zone files, and thus become resolvable. However, an issue of scalability arises when there is a large number of variant IDLs to be activated.In this article, the authors present a resolution protocol that resolves the variant IDLs into the registered IDL, specifically for Han character variants. Two Han characters are said to be variants of each other if they have the same meaning and are pronounced the same. Furthermore, Han character variants usually have similar appearances. It is not uncommon that a Chinese IDL has a large number of variant IDLs. The proposed protocol introduces a new RR (resource record) type, denoted as VarIdx RR, to associate a variant expression of the variant IDLs with the registered IDL. The label of the VarIdx RR, denoted as the variant index, is assigned by an indexing function that is designed to give the same value to all of the variant IDLs enumerated by the variant expression. When one of the variant IDLs is accessed, Internet applications can compute the variant index, look up the VarIdx RRs, and resolve the variant IDL into the registered IDL.The authors examine two sets of Chinese IDLs registered in TWNIC and CNNIC, respectively. The results show that for a registered Chinese IDL, a very small number of VarIdx RRs, usually one or two, are sufficient to activate all of its variant IDLs.

Nearly all the top performing systems use heavy methods that require sophisticated techniques, such as parsers or logic provers. However, such techniques are usually unavailable or unaffordable for under-resourced languages or in resource-limited situations. In this article, we describe how a top-performing Chinese QA system can be designed by using lightweight methods effectively. We propose two lightweight methods, namely the Sum of Co-occurrences of Question and Answer Terms (SCO-QAT) and Alignment-based Surface Patterns (ABSPs). SCO-QAT is a co-occurrence-based answer-ranking method that does not need extra knowledge, word-ignoring heuristic rules, or tools. It calculates co-occurrence scores based on the passage retrieval results. ABSPs are syntactic patterns trained from question-answer pairs with a multiple alignment algorithm. They are used to capture the relations between terms and then use the relations to filter answers. We attribute the success of the ABSPs and SCO-QAT methods to the effective use of local syntactic information and global co-occurrence information.By using SCO-QAT and ABSPs, we improved the RU-Accuracy of our testbed QA system, ASQA, from 0.445 to 0.535 on the NTCIR-5 dataset. It also achieved the top 0.5 RU-Accuracy on the NTCIR-6 dataset. The result shows that lightweight methods are not only cheaper to implement, but also have the potential to achieve state-of-the-art performances.", "authors": [{"name": "cheng-wei lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81324491402"}, {"name": "min-yuh day", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100616593"}, {"name": "cheng-lung sung", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332530447"}, {"name": "yi-hsun lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81385595282"}, {"name": "tian-jian jiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384608672"}, {"name": "chia-wei wu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384603081"}, {"name": "cheng-wei shih", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81385599860"}, {"name": "yu-ren chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81385597826"}, {"name": "wen-lian hsu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451593669"}], "title": "Boosting Chinese Question Answering with Two Lightweight Methods: ABSPs and SCO-QAT", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "11\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "263\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national tsing-hua university taiwan and academia sinica", "city": null, "Name": "cheng-wei lee"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "academia sinica", "city": null, "Name": "min-yuh day"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "academia sinica", "city": null, "Name": "cheng-lung sung"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "academia sinica", "city": null, "Name": "yi-hsun lee"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "academia sinica", "city": null, "Name": "tian-jian jiang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "academia sinica", "city": null, "Name": "chia-wei wu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "academia sinica", "city": null, "Name": "cheng-wei shih"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "academia sinica", "city": null, "Name": "yu-ren chen"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "academia sinica", "city": null, "Name": "wen-lian hsu"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["Collin F.

Given a sentence, the task of SRL is to recognize semantic arguments (roles) for each predicate (target verb or noun). Feature-based methods have achieved much success in SRL and are regarded as the state-of-the-art methods for SRL. However, these methods are less effective in modeling structured features. As an extension of feature-based methods, kernel-based methods are able to capture structured features more efficiently in a much higher dimension. Application of kernel methods to SRL has been achieved by selecting the tree portion of a predicate and one of its arguments as feature space, which is named as predicate-argument feature (PAF) kernel. The PAF kernel captures the syntactic tree structure features using convolution tree kernel, however, it does not distinguish between the path structure and the constituent structure. In this article, a hybrid convolution tree kernel is proposed to model different linguistic objects. The hybrid convolution tree kernel consists of two individual convolution tree kernels. They are a Path kernel, which captures predicate-argument link features, and a Constituent Structure kernel, which captures the syntactic structure features of arguments. Evaluations on the data sets of the CoNLL-2005 SRL shared task and the Chinese PropBank (CPB) show that our proposed hybrid convolution tree kernel statistically significantly outperforms the previous tree kernels. Moreover, in order to maximize the system performance, we present a composite kernel through combining our hybrid convolution tree kernel method with a feature-based method extended by the polynomial kernel. The experimental results show that the composite kernel achieves better performance than each of the individual methods and outperforms the best reported system on the CoNLL-2005 corpus when only one syntactic parser is used and on the CPB corpus when automated syntactic parse results and correct syntactic parse results are used respectively.", "authors": [{"name": "wanxiang che", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81385592994"}, {"name": "min zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81423595919"}, {"name": "aiti aw", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332488633"}, {"name": "chewlim tan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100256274"}, {"name": "ting liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332513140"}, {"name": "sheng li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81423594103"}], "title": "Using a Hybrid Convolution Tree Kernel for Semantic Role Labeling", "citations": [{"Name": "Yanyan Zhao ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bing Qin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shen Hu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ting Liu", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Generalizing syntactic structures for product attribute candidate extraction", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "17\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "248\n", "Citation Count": "5\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "china", "university": "harbin institute of technology", "affiliation_string": "harbin institute of technology", "city": "harbin", "Name": "wanxiang che"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "min zhang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "aiti aw"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": "national university of singapore", "affiliation_string": "national university of singapore", "city": "singapore", "Name": "chewlim tan"}, {"country": "china", "university": "harbin institute of technology", "affiliation_string": "harbin institute of technology", "city": "harbin", "Name": "ting liu"}, {"country": "china", "university": "harbin institute of technology", "affiliation_string": "harbin institute of technology", "city": "harbin", "Name": "sheng li"}]}}, "date": {"month": "November", "year": "2008"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Regina Barzilay , Kathleen R.

We present a temporal resolution algorithm, using focusing time and coreference chains, to convert Chinese temporal expressions in a document into calendrical forms. Moreover, we consider the last calendrical form of a sentence as a sentence time stamp to address sentence ordering. Informative words, event words, and temporal words are introduced to a sentence reduction algorithm, which deals with both length constraints and information coverage.

The performance of a machine translation system depends heavily on precise translation of the inclusive NEs. Furthermore, organization name (ON) is the most complex NE for translation among all the NEs. In this article, the structure formulation of ONs is investigated and a hierarchical structure-based ON translation model for Chinese-to-English translation system is presented.First, the model performs ON chunking; then both the translation of words within chunks and the process of chunk-reordering are achieved by synchronous context-free grammar (CFG). The CFG rules are extracted from bilingual ON pairs in a training program.The main contributions of this article are: (1) defining appropriate chunk-units for analyzing the internal structure of Chinese ONs; (2) making the chunk-based ON translation feasible and flexible via a hierarchical CFG derivation; and (3) proposing a training architecture to automatically learn the synchronous CFG for constructing ONs with chunk-units from aligned bilingual ON pairs. The experiments show that the proposed approach translates the Chinese ONs into English with an accuracy of 93.75&percnt; and significantly improves the performance of a baseline statistical machine translation (SMT) system.", "authors": [{"name": "yufeng chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81343489915"}, {"name": "chengqing zong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329493259"}], "title": "A Structure-Based Model for Chinese Organization Name Translation", "citations": [{"Name": "Fan Yang ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jun Zhao ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kang Liu", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "A Chinese-English organization name translation system using heuristic web mining and asymmetric alignment", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yilu Zhou", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Maximum N-gram HMM-based name transliteration: experiment in NEWS 2009 on English-Chinese corpus", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Feiliang Ren ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Muhua Zhu ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Huizhen Wang ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jingbo Zhu", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chinese-English organization name translation based on correlative expansion", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "25\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "565\n", "Citation Count": "6\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "institute of automation chinese academy of sciences", "city": null, "Name": "yufeng chen"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "institute of automation chinese academy of sciences", "city": null, "Name": "chengqing zong"}]}}, "date": {"month": "February", "year": "2008"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 8": {"references": ["Rakesh Agrawal , Ramakrishnan Srikant, Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases, Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, p.487-499, September 12-15, 1994\n", "Rakesh Agrawal , Ramakrishnan Srikant, On integrating catalogs, Proceedings of the 10th international conference on World Wide Web, p.603-612, May 01-05, 2001, Hong Kong, Hong Kong[doi>10.1145/371920.372163]\n", "James Allan, Topic Detection and Tracking: Event-Based Information Organization, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA, 2002\n", "Chen, F., Farahat, A., and Brants, T.2004.

Most of the\r\nsearch engines on the Web service find documents that are assigned\r\nto a single classification hierarchy. Categories in the hierarchy\r\nare carefully defined by human experts and documents are well\r\norganized. However, a single hierarchy in one language is often\r\ninsufficient to find all relevant material, as each hierarchy tends\r\nto have some bias in both defining hierarchical structure and\r\nclassifying documents.

The method does\r\nnot simply merge two different hierarchies into one large hierarchy\r\nbut instead extracts sets of similar categories, where each element\r\nof the sets is relevant with each other.

First, we classify documents from one hierarchy into\r\ncategories with another hierarchy using a cross-language text\r\nclassification (CLTC) technique, and extract category pairs of two\r\nhierarchies.

Most previously proposed approaches adopt a two-step\r\napproach where syllables within an utterance are identified via\r\nforced alignment first, and tone recognition using a variety of\r\nclassifiers---such as neural networks, Gaussian mixture models\r\n(GMM), hidden Markov models (HMM), support vector machines\r\n(SVM)---is then performed on each segmented syllable to predict its\r\ntone. However, forced alignment does not always generate accurate\r\nsyllable boundaries, leading to unstable voiced-unvoiced detection\r\nand deteriorating performance in tone recognition. Aiming to\r\nalleviate this problem, we propose a robust approach called Tone\r\nRecognition Using Extended Segments (TRUES) for HMM-based\r\ncontinuous tone recognition. The proposed approach extracts an\r\nunbroken pitch contour from a given utterance based on dynamic\r\nprogramming over time-domain acoustic features of average magnitude\r\ndifference function (AMDF). The pitch contour of each syllable is\r\nthen extended for tri-tone HMM modeling, such that the influence\r\nfrom inaccurate syllable boundaries is lessened. Our experimental\r\nresults demonstrate that the proposed TRUES achieves 49.13%\r\nrelative error rate reduction over that of the recently proposed\r\nsupratone modeling, which is deemed the state of the art of tone\r\nrecognition that outperforms several previously proposed\r\napproaches.

Although Assamese is one of Indias national languages, it\r\nutterly lacks computational linguistic resources. There exists no\r\nprior computational work on this language spoken widely in\r\nnortheast India. The work presented is pioneering in this respect.\r\nIn this article, we discuss salient issues in Assamese morphology\r\nwhere the presence of a large number of suffixal determiners,\r\nsandhi, samas, and the propensity to use suffix sequences make\r\napproximately 50% of the words used in written and spoken text\r\ninflected. We implement methods proposed by Gaussier and Goldsmith\r\non acquisition of morphological knowledge, and obtain F-measure\r\nperformance below 60%. This motivates us to present a method more\r\nsuitable for handling suffix sequences, enabling us to increase the\r\nF-measure performance of morphology acquisition to almost 70%. We\r\ndescribe how we build a morphological dictionary for Assamese from\r\nthe text corpus. Using the morphological knowledge acquired and the\r\nmorphological dictionary, we are able to process small chunks of\r\ndata at a time as well as a large corpus.

However, previous works on applying SVMs to the F-term patent classification task did not obtain as good results as other learning algorithms such as kNN. This is due to the fact that F-term patent classification is different from conventional document classification in several aspects, mainly because it is a multiclass, multilabel classification problem with semi-structured documents and multi-faceted hierarchical categories.This article describes our SVM-based system and several techniques we developed successfully to adapt SVM for the specific features of the F-term patent classification task. We evaluate the techniques using the NTCIR-6 F-term classification terms assigned to Japanese patents. Moreover, our system participated in the NTCIR-6 patent classification evaluation and obtained the best results according to two of the three metrics used for task performance evaluation. Following the NTCIR-6 participation, we developed two new techniques, which achieved even better scores using all three NTCIR-6 metrics, effectively outperforming all participating systems.

The core of the system implements a standard phrase-based statistical machine translation architecture, but it is extended by incorporating a local discriminative phrase selection model to address the semantic ambiguity of Arabic. Local classifiers are trained using linguistic information and context to translate a phrase, and this significantly increases the accuracy in phrase selection with respect to the most frequent translation traditionally considered. These classifiers are integrated into the translation system so that the global task gets benefits from the discriminative learning. As a result, we obtain significant improvements in the full translation task at the lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels as measured by an heterogeneous set of automatic evaluation metrics.", "authors": [{"name": "cristina espana-bonet", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453652828"}, {"name": "jesus gimenez", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332500659"}, {"name": "lluis marquez", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100371133"}], "title": "Discriminative Phrase-Based Models for Arabic Machine Translation", "citations": [{"Name": "Rafael E.

The purpose of this article is to describe some of these challenges and to present some solutions that would guide current and future practitioners in the field of Arabic natural language processing (ANLP). We begin with general features of the Arabic language in Sections 1, 2, and 3 and then we move to more specific properties of the language in the rest of the article. In Section 1 of this article we highlight the significance of the Arabic language today and describe its general properties. Section 2 presents the feature of Arabic Diglossia showing how the sociolinguistic aspects of the Arabic language differ from other languages. The stability of Arabic Diglossia and its implications for ANLP applications are discussed and ways to deal with this problematic property are proposed. Section 3 deals with the properties of the Arabic script and the explosion of ambiguity that results from the absence of short vowel representations and overt case markers in contemporary Arabic texts. We present in Section 4 specific features of the Arabic language such as the nonconcatenative property of Arabic morphology, Arabic as an agglutinative language, Arabic as a pro-drop language, and the challenge these properties pose to ANLP. We also present solutions that have already been adopted by some pioneering researchers in the field. In Section 5 we point out to the lack of formal and explicit grammars of Modern Standard Arabic which impedes the progress of more advanced ANLP systems. In Section 6 we draw our conclusion.", "authors": [{"name": "ali farghaly", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81443592861"}, {"name": "khaled shaalan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100648030"}], "title": "Arabic Natural Language Processing: Challenges and Solutions", "citations": [{"Name": "Aqil M.

Being a highly inflected language, the Arabic language has a very large lexical variety and typically with several possible (generally semantically linked) vowelizations for each written form. This article summarizes research carried out over the last few years on speech-to-text transcription of broadcast data in Arabic. The initial research was oriented toward processing of broadcast news data in Modern Standard Arabic, and has since been extended to address a larger variety of broadcast data, which as a consequence results in the need to also be able to handle dialectal speech. While standard techniques in speech recognition have been shown to apply well to the Arabic language, taking into account language specificities help to significantly improve system performance.", "authors": [{"name": "lori lamel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100126639"}, {"name": "abdelkhalek messaoudi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453639450"}, {"name": "jean-luc gauvain", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100272666"}], "title": "Automatic Speech-to-Text Transcription in Arabic", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "37\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "371\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "limsi-cnrs", "city": null, "Name": "lori lamel"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "limsi-cnrs", "city": null, "Name": "abdelkhalek messaoudi"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "limsi-cnrs", "city": null, "Name": "jean-luc gauvain"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/1644879.1644880", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "k shaalan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87059227357"}, {"name": "a farghaly", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81443592861"}], "title": "Introduction to the Special Issue on Arabic Natural Language Processing", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "24\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "310\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united arab emirates", "university": "british university in dubai", "affiliation_string": "the british university in dubai", "city": "dubai", "Name": "k shaalan"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "monterey institute of international studies", "city": null, "Name": "a farghaly"}]}, "Article No.: 16": {"references": ["Yassine Benajiba , Mona Diab , Paolo Rosso, Arabic named entity recognition using optimized feature sets, Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, October 25-27, 2008, Honolulu, Hawaii\n", "Adam L.

Therefore, the word-segmentation step is worth a deeper study since it is a preprocessing step which shall have a significant impact on all the steps coming afterward. In this article, we present an Arabic mention detection system that has very competitive results in the recent Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) evaluation campaign. We investigate the impact of different segmentation schemes on Arabic mention detection systems and we show how these systems may benefit from more than one segmentation scheme. We report the performance of several mention detection models using different kinds of possible and known segmentation schemes for Arabic text: punctuation separation, Arabic Treebank, and morphological and character-level segmentations. We show that the combination of competitive segmentation styles leads to a better performance.

Despite this valiant effort, there are still many languages left that have only small amounts of such resources. The goal of this article is to present and investigate a method of propagating information (specifically mention detection) from a resource-rich language into a relatively resource-poor language such as Arabic. Part of the investigation is to quantify the contribution of propagating information in different conditions based on the availability of resources in the target language. Experiments on the language pair Arabic-English show that one can achieve relatively decent performance by propagating information from a language with richer resources such as English into Arabic alone (no resources or models in the source language Arabic). Furthermore, results show that propagated features from English do help improve the Arabic system performance even when used in conjunction with all feature types built from the source language. Experiments also show that using propagated features in conjunction with lexically derived features only (as can be obtained directly from a mention annotated corpus) brings the system performance at the one obtained in the target language by using feature derived from many linguistic resources, therefore improving the system when such resources are not available. In addition to Arabic-English language pair, we investigate the effectiveness of our approach on other language pairs such as Chinese-English and Spanish-English.", "authors": [{"name": "imed zitouni", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323498894"}, {"name": "radu florian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329488703"}], "title": "Cross-Language Information Propagation for Arabic Mention Detection", "citations": [{"Name": "Yassine Benajiba ", "Country": "sweden", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Imed Zitouni ", "Country": "sweden", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mona Diab ", "Country": "sweden", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Paolo Rosso", "Country": "sweden", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Radu Florian ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "John F.

We also investigate the use of unsupervised summarizers to improve the performance of supervised summarizers when manual labels are not available for training the latter. A novel training data selection approach that leverages the relevance information of spoken sentences to select reliable document-summary pairs derived by the probabilistic generative summarizers is explored for training the classification-based summarizers.

Phrase-based and syntax-based methods represent the state-of-the-art for statistical machine translation (SMT). The phrase-based method specializes in modeling local reorderings and translations of multiword expressions. The syntax-based method is enhanced by using syntactic knowledge, which can better model long word reorderings, discontinuous phrases, and syntactic structure. In this article, we leverage on the strength of these two methods and propose a strategy based on multiple hypotheses generation in a two-stage framework for spoken language translation. The hypotheses are generated in two stages, namely, decoding and regeneration. In the decoding stage, we apply state-of-the-art, phrase-based, and syntax-based methods to generate basic translation hypotheses. Then in the regeneration stage, much more hypotheses that cannot be captured by the decoding algorithms are produced from the basic hypotheses. We study three regeneration methods: redecoding, n-gram expansion, and confusion network in the second stage. Finally, an additional reranking pass is introduced to select the translation outputs by a linear combination of rescoring models. Experimental results on the Chinese-to-English IWSLT-2006 challenge task of translating the transcription of spontaneous speech show that the proposed mechanism achieves significant improvements over the baseline of about 2.80 BLEU-score.", "authors": [{"name": "boxing chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81414609642"}, {"name": "min zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81423595919"}, {"name": "ai ti aw", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332488633"}], "title": "Two-Stage Hypotheses Generation for Spoken Language Translation", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "18\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "292\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "singapore", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "institute for infocomm research singapore", "city": null, "Name": "boxing chen"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "institute for infocomm research singapore", "city": null, "Name": "min zhang"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "institute for infocomm research singapore", "city": null, "Name": "ai ti aw"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["James Allan , Jay Aslam , Nicholas Belkin , Chris Buckley , Jamie Callan , Bruce Croft , Sue Dumais , Norbert Fuhr , Donna Harman , David J.

It also has been introduced to information retrieval (IR) problems, and provided an effective and theoretically attractive probabilistic framework for building IR systems. In this article, we propose a word topic model (WTM) to explore the co-occurrence relationship between words, as well as the long-span latent topical information, for language modeling in spoken document retrieval and transcription. The document or the search history as a whole is modeled as a composite WTM model for generating a newly observed word. The underlying characteristics and different kinds of model structures are extensively investigated, while the performance of WTM is thoroughly analyzed and verified by comparison with the well-known probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) model as well as the other models. The IR experiments are performed on the TDT Chinese collections (TDT-2 and TDT-3), while the large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) experiments are conducted on the Mandarin broadcast news collected in Taiwan. Experimental results seem to indicate that WTM is a promising alternative to the existing models.", "authors": [{"name": "berlin chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100108013"}], "title": "Word Topic Models for Spoken Document Retrieval and Transcription", "citations": [{"Name": "Berlin Chen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kuan-Yu Chen", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Leveraging relevance cues for language modeling in speech recognition", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Berlin Chen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shih-Hsiang Lin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yu-Mei Chang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jia-Wen Liu", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Extractive speech summarization using evaluation metric-related training criteria", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "26\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "470\n", "Citation Count": "15\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "taiwan", "university": "national taiwan normal university", "affiliation_string": "national taiwan normal university", "city": "taibei", "Name": "berlin chen"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2009"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Christopher J.

Here, at first, the document is segmented into lines and then lines are segmented into character groups (words).

Currently, several supervised learning methods can be used for training high-performance dependency parsers if sufficient labeled data are available.However, currently used statistical dependency parsers provide poor results for words separated by long distances. In order to solve this problem, this article presents an effective dependency parsing approach of incorporating short dependency information from unlabeled data. The unlabeled data is automatically parsed by using a deterministic dependency parser, which exhibits a relatively high performance for short dependencies between words. We then train another parser that uses the information on short dependency relations extracted from the output of the first parser. The proposed approach achieves an unlabeled attachment score of 86.52&percnt;, an absolute 1.24&percnt; improvement over the baseline system on the Chinese Treebank data set. The results indicate that the proposed approach improves the parsing performance for longer distance words.", "authors": [{"name": "wenliang chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81447594772"}, {"name": "daisuke kawahara", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100310549"}, {"name": "kiyotaka uchimoto", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100120213"}, {"name": "yujie zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309509585"}, {"name": "hitoshi isahara", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100636896"}], "title": "Using Short Dependency Relations from Auto-Parsed Data for Chinese Dependency Parsing", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "14\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "282\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of information and communications technology", "city": null, "Name": "wenliang chen"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of information and communications technology", "city": null, "Name": "daisuke kawahara"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of information and communications technology", "city": null, "Name": "kiyotaka uchimoto"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of information and communications technology", "city": null, "Name": "yujie zhang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of information and communications technology", "city": null, "Name": "hitoshi isahara"}]}, "Article No.: 12": {"references": ["Andrieu, C., Freitas, N., Doucet, A., and Jordan, M. 2003.

There are three key requirements for such post-retrieval clustering systems: (1) the clustering algorithm should group similar documents together; (2) clusters should be labeled with descriptive phrases; and (3) the clustering system should provide high-quality clustering without downloading the whole Web page.This article introduces a novel framework for clustering Web search results in Vietnamese which targets the three above issues. The main motivation is that by enriching short snippets with hidden topics from huge resources of documents on the Internet, it is able to cluster and label such snippets effectively in a topic-oriented manner without concerning whole Web pages. Our approach is based on recent successful topic analysis models, such as Probabilistic-Latent Semantic Analysis, or Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The underlying idea of the framework is that we collect a very large external data collection called \u201cuniversal dataset,\u201d and then build a clustering system on both the original snippets and a rich set of hidden topics discovered from the universal data collection. This can be seen as a richer representation of snippets to be clustered. We carry out careful evaluation of our method and show that our method can yield impressive clustering quality.", "authors": [{"name": "cam-tu nguyen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435593761"}, {"name": "xuan-hieu phan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100629475"}, {"name": "susumu horiguchi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100101996"}, {"name": "thu-trang nguyen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442594300"}, {"name": "quang-thuy ha", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435604563"}], "title": "Web Search Clustering and Labeling with Hidden Topics", "citations": [{"Name": "Ou Jin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nathan N.

This article proposes an integrated framework for building a bilingual lexicon between the Chinese and Japanese languages. Since the language pair Chinese-Japanese does not include English, which is a central language of the world, few large-scale bilingual resources between Chinese and Japanese have been constructed. One solution to alleviate this problem is to build a Chinese-Japanese bilingual lexicon through English as the pivot language. In addition to the pivotal approach, we can make use of the characteristics of Chinese and Japanese languages that use Han characters. We incorporate a translation model obtained from a small Chinese-Japanese lexicon and use the similarity of the hanzi and kanji characters by using the log-linear model. Our experimental results show that the use of the pivotal approach can improve the translation performance over the translation model built from a small Chinese-Japanese lexicon. The results also demonstrate that the similarity between the hanzi and kanji characters provides a positive effect for translating technical terms.", "authors": [{"name": "takashi tsunakawa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435608200"}, {"name": "naoaki okazaki", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309496001"}, {"name": "xiao liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435596661"}, {"name": "junichi tsujii", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435601882"}], "title": "A Chinese-Japanese Lexical Machine Translation through a Pivot Language", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "26\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "312\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of tokyo", "city": null, "Name": "takashi tsunakawa"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of tokyo", "city": null, "Name": "naoaki okazaki"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of tokyo", "city": null, "Name": "xiao liu"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of manchester", "affiliation_string": "university of tokyo university of manchester national centre for text mining uk", "city": "manchester", "Name": "junichi tsujii"}]}, "Article No.: 8": {"references": ["Allauzen, C., Mohri, M., Riley, M., and Roark, B.2004.

Indian languages are morphologically rich and have relatively free-word order where the grammatical role of content words is largely determined by their case markers and not just by their positions in the sentence.

Our approach is motivated from the insight that PB-SMT systems can be improved by optimizing the input representation to reduce the predictive power of translation models. We firstly present an approach to optimize the existing segmentation of both source and target languages for PB-SMT and demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using a Chinese--English MT task, that is, to measure the influence of the segmentation on the performance of PB-SMT systems. We report a 5.44&percnt; relative increase in Bleu score and a consistent increase according to other metrics. We then generalize this method for Chinese word segmentation without relying on any segmenters and show that using our segmentation PB-SMT can achieve more consistent state-of-the-art performance across two domains. There are two main advantages of our approach. First of all, it is adapted to the specific translation task at hand by taking the corresponding source (target) language into account. Second, this approach does not rely on manually segmented training data so that it can be automatically adapted for different domains.", "authors": [{"name": "yanjun ma", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435598684"}, {"name": "andy way", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100283426"}], "title": "Bilingually Motivated Word Segmentation for Statistical Machine Translation", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "19\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "320\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "city university", "affiliation_string": "dublin city university", "city": "london", "Name": "yanjun ma"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "city university", "affiliation_string": "dublin city university", "city": "london", "Name": "andy way"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/1526252.1526253", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "david chiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100152803"}, {"name": "philipp koehn", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100365420"}], "title": "Introduction to the Special Issue on Machine Translation of Asian Languages", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "16\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "276\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Hong Kong", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of southern california information sciences institute", "city": "southern", "Name": "david chiang"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of edinburgh", "affiliation_string": "university of edinburgh school of informatics", "city": "edinburgh", "Name": "philipp koehn"}]}}, "date": {"month": "May", "year": "2009"}}}, "Volume14": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Article No.: 16": {"references": ["Gerlof Bouma. 2009.

Experiments show that our framework outperforms other systems, which adopted the same or similar resources as ours in the SIGHAN 7 shared task; even comparing with the state-of-the-art systems, which used more resources, such as a considerable large dictionary, an idiom dictionary and other semantic information, our framework still obtains competitive results. Furthermore, to address the resource scarceness problem for training the SMT model, we generate around 2 million artificial training sentences using the Chinese character confusion sets, which include a set of Chinese characters with similar shapes and similar pronunciations, provided by the SIGHAN 7 shared task.", "authors": [{"name": "xiaodong liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658726253"}, {"name": "fei cheng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658762577"}, {"name": "kevin duh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323489590"}, {"name": "yuji matsumoto", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100316381"}], "title": "A Hybrid Ranking Approach to Chinese Spelling Check", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "29\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "29\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "austria", "university": "institute of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "nara institute of science and technology japan", "city": "klosterneuburg", "Name": "xiaodong liu"}, {"country": "austria", "university": "institute of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "nara institute of science and technology japan", "city": "klosterneuburg", "Name": "fei cheng"}, {"country": "austria", "university": "institute of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "nara institute of science and technology japan", "city": "klosterneuburg", "Name": "kevin duh"}, {"country": "austria", "university": "institute of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "nara institute of science and technology japan", "city": "klosterneuburg", "Name": "yuji matsumoto"}]}, "Article No.: 18": {"references": ["Chao-Huang Chang. 1995.

The former makes it difficult for a spell checker to detect spelling errors, and the latter makes it difficult for a spell checker to construct error models. We develop a word lattice decoding model for a Chinese spell checker that addresses these difficulties. The model performs word segmentation and error correction simultaneously, thereby solving the word boundary problem. The model corrects nonword errors as well as real-word errors. In order to better estimate the error distribution of large character sets for error models, we also propose a methodology to extract spelling error samples automatically from the Google web 1T corpus. Due to the large quantity of data in the Google web 1T corpus, many spelling error samples can be extracted, better reflecting spelling error distributions in the real world. Finally, in order to improve the spell checker for real applications, we produce n-best suggestions for spelling error corrections. We test our proposed approach with the Bakeoff 2013 CSC Datasets; the results show that the proposed methods with the error model significantly outperform the performance of Chinese spell checkers that do not use error models.", "authors": [{"name": "yu-ming hsieh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81496676686"}, {"name": "ming-hong bai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81458646007"}, {"name": "shu-ling huang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81481644221"}, {"name": "keh-jiann chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81392601185"}], "title": "Correcting Chinese Spelling Errors with Word Lattice Decoding", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "47\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "47\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "academia sinica and national tsing hua university", "city": null, "Name": "yu-ming hsieh"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "academia sinica", "city": null, "Name": "ming-hong bai"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "academia sinica", "city": null, "Name": "shu-ling huang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "academia sinica", "city": null, "Name": "keh-jiann chen"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Robert Dale , Adam Kilgarriff, Helping our own: text massaging for computational linguistics as a new shared task, Proceedings of the 6th International Natural Language Generation Conference, July 07-09, 2010, Trim, Co.

Pruning based on a contextual dependency confidence measure was used to markedly reduce the search space and computational complexity. Relevant mapping relations between the original input and desired input were obtained using a scoring mechanism composed of class-based language and maximum entropy correction models containing character, word, and contextual features. The proposed method was evaluated using data sets provided by SigHan 7 bakeoff.

Recently, more and more CSC systems have been proposed. To the best of our knowledge, language modeling is one of the major components among these systems because of its simplicity and moderately good predictive power. After deeply analyzing the school of research, we are aware that most of the systems only employ the conventionaln-gram language models. The contributions of this article are threefold. First, we propose a novel probabilistic framework for CSC, which naturally combines several important components, such as the substitution model and the language model, to inherit their individual merits as well as to overcome their limitations. Second, we incorporate the topic language models into the CSC system in an unsupervised fashion. The topic language models can capture the long-span semantic information from a word (character) string while the conventionaln-gram language models can only preserve the local regularity information. Third, we further integrate Web resources with the proposed framework to enhance the overall performance. Our rigorously empirical experiments demonstrate the consistent and utility performance of the proposed framework in the CSC task.", "authors": [{"name": "kuan-yu chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81501657514"}, {"name": "hsin-min wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350588658"}, {"name": "hsin-hsi chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658732794"}], "title": "A Probabilistic Framework for Chinese Spelling Check", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "22\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "22\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "taiwan", "university": "national taiwan university", "affiliation_string": "academia sinica taiwan and national taiwan university taiwan", "city": "taibei", "Name": "kuan-yu chen"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "academia sinica taiwan", "city": null, "Name": "hsin-min wang"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "national taiwan university", "affiliation_string": "national taiwan university taiwan", "city": "taibei", "Name": "hsin-hsi chen"}]}}, "date": {"month": "October", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Ahn, D., Rantwijk, J., and Rijke, M. 2007.

For some languages including English, the availability of large annotated corpora and the development of data-based induction of lexicalized grammar have enabled deep parsing, i.e., parsing based on lexicalized grammars. However, deep parsing for Japanese has not been widely studied. This is mainly because most Japanese syntactic resources are represented in chunk-based dependency structures, while previous methods for inducing grammars are dependent on tree corpora. To translate syntactic information presented in chunk-based dependencies to phrase structures as accurately as possible, integration of annotation from multiple dependency-based corpora is proposed. Our method first integrates dependency structures and predicate-argument information and converts them into phrase structure trees. The trees are then transformed into CCG derivations in a similar way to previously proposed methods. The quality of the conversion is empirically evaluated in terms of the coverage of the obtained CCG lexicon and the accuracy of the parsing with the grammar. While the transforming process used in this study is specialized for Japanese, the framework of our method would be applicable to other languages for which dependency-based analysis has been regarded as more appropriate than phrase structure-based analysis due to morphosyntactic features.", "authors": [{"name": "sumire uematsu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81438597778"}, {"name": "takuya matsuzaki", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310490814"}, {"name": "hiroki hanaoka", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81487653303"}, {"name": "yusuke miyao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100124297"}, {"name": "hideki mima", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81408603046"}], "title": "Integrating Multiple Dependency Corpora for Inducing Wide-Coverage Japanese CCG Resources", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "78\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "110\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of tokyo", "city": null, "Name": "sumire uematsu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "takuya matsuzaki"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "takuya matsuzaki", "city": null, "Name": "hiroki hanaokathe university of tokyo"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of tokyo", "city": null, "Name": "hideki mima"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Rasim M.

In this article, we propose a framework for extracting a bilingual dictionary from comparable corpora by exploiting a novel combination of topic modeling and word aligners such as the IBM models. Using a multilingual topic model, we first convert a comparabledocument-aligned corpus into a paralleltopic-aligned corpus. This novel topic-aligned corpus is similar in structure to thesentence-aligned corpus frequently employed in statistical machine translation and allows us to extract a bilingual dictionary using a word alignment model.The main advantages of our framework is that (1) no seed dictionary is necessary for bootstrapping the process, and (2) multilingual comparable corpora in more than two languages can also be exploited. In our experiments on a large-scale Wikipedia dataset, we demonstrate that our approach can extract higher precision dictionaries compared to previous approaches and that our method improves further as we add more languages to the dataset.", "authors": [{"name": "xiaodong liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658726253"}, {"name": "kevin duh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323489590"}, {"name": "yuji matsumoto", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658728262"}], "title": "Multilingual Topic Models for Bilingual Dictionary Extraction", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "140\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "140\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "austria", "university": "institute of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "nara institute of science and technology", "city": "klosterneuburg", "Name": "xiaodong liu"}, {"country": "austria", "university": "institute of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "nara institute of science and technology", "city": "klosterneuburg", "Name": "kevin duh"}, {"country": "austria", "university": "institute of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "nara institute of science and technology", "city": "klosterneuburg", "Name": "yuji matsumoto"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Jae-Hyeok Choi and Sang-Jo Lee. 1993.

Similar to methods used for Chinese, we perform two disambiguation procedures based on CRFs: (1) morpheme segmentation and (2) POS tagging. In morpheme segmentation, an input sentence is segmented into sequences of morphemes, where a morpheme unit is either atomic or compound. In the POS tagging procedure, each morpheme (atomic or compound) is assigned a POS tag. Once POS tagging is complete, we carry out a post-processing of the compound morphemes, where each compound morpheme is further decomposed into atomic morphemes, which is based on pre-analyzed patterns and generalized HMMs obtained from the given tagged corpus. Experimental results show the promise of our proposed method.", "authors": [{"name": "seung-hoon na", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=86158961057"}], "title": "Conditional Random Fields for Korean Morpheme Segmentation and POS Tagging", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "178\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "178\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": []}, "Article No.: 12": {"references": ["Baroni, M. 2009.

This article mainly addresses the following three types of OOV: unseen dictionary words, named entities, and suffix-derived words, none of which are handled well by current approaches. The results show that our approach can effectively improve the performance of the first two types with positive interaction in F-score. Additionally, we also analyze reason that suffix information is not helpful. After integrating the proposed generative model with the corresponding discriminative approach, our evaluation on various corpora---including SIGHAN-2005, CIPS-SIGHAN-2010, and the Chinese Treebank (CTB)---shows that our integrated approach achieves the best performance reported in the literature on all testing sets when additional information and resources are allowed.", "authors": [{"name": "xiaoqing li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658726333"}, {"name": "chengqing zong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329493259"}, {"name": "keh-yih su", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451593455"}], "title": "A Unified Model for Solving the OOV Problem of Chinese Word Segmentation", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "109\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "109\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "chinese academy of sciences", "city": null, "Name": "xiaoqing li"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "chinese academy of sciences", "city": null, "Name": "chengqing zong"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "academia sinica", "city": null, "Name": "keh-yih su"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["A.

Although some word reordering methods do not employ source-language syntactic structures, such structures are inherently useful for word reordering. However, high-quality syntactic parsers are not available for many languages. We propose a preordering method using a target-language syntactic parser to process source-language syntactic structures without a source-language syntactic parser. To train our preordering model based on ITG, we produced syntactic constituent structures for source-language training sentences by (1) parsing target-language training sentences, (2) projecting constituent structures of the target-language sentences to the corresponding source-language sentences, (3) selecting parallel sentences with highly synchronized parallel structures, (4) producing probabilistic models for parsing using the projected partial structures and the Pitman-Yor process, and (5) parsing to produce full binary syntactic structures maximally synchronized with the corresponding target-language syntactic structures, using the constraints of the projected partial structures and the probabilistic models. Our ITG-based preordering model is trained using the produced binary syntactic structures and word alignments. The proposed method facilitates the learning of ITG by producing highly synchronized parallel syntactic structures based on cross-language syntactic projection and sentence selection. The preordering model jointly parses input sentences and identifies their reordered structures. Experiments with Japanese--English and Chinese--English patent translation indicate that our method outperforms existing methods, including string-to-tree syntax-based SMT, a preordering method that does not require a parser, and a preordering method that uses a source-language dependency parser.", "authors": [{"name": "isao goto", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323490532"}, {"name": "masao utiyama", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100491189"}, {"name": "eiichiro sumita", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81328490654"}, {"name": "sadao kurohashi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100374659"}], "title": "Preordering using a Target-Language Parser via Cross-Language Syntactic Projection for Statistical Machine Translation", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "205\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "19\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "205\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "japan", "university": "kyoto university", "affiliation_string": "national institute of information and communications technology nhk and kyoto university", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "isao goto"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of information and communications technology", "city": null, "Name": "masao utiyama"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of information and communications technology", "city": null, "Name": "eiichiro sumita"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "kyoto university", "affiliation_string": "kyoto university", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "sadao kurohashi"}]}}, "date": {"month": "June", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 8": {"references": ["K.

Contributions have been made with regard to two issues hardly addressed in the online Indic word recognition literature, namely, use of (1) language models exploiting the idiosyncrasies of Indic scripts and (2) expert classifiers for the disambiguation of confused symbols.The input word is first segmented into its individual symbols, which are recognized using a primary support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Thereafter, we enhance the recognition accuracy by utilizing (i) a bigram language model at the symbol or character level and (ii) expert classifiers for reevaluating and disambiguating the different sets of confused symbols. The symbol-level bigram model is used in a traditional Viterbi framework. The concept of a character comprising multiple symbols is unique to Dravidian languages such as Tamil. This multi-symbol feature of Tamil characters has been exploited in proposing a novel, prefix-tree-based character-level bigram model that does not use Viterbi search; rather it reduces the search space for each input symbol based on its left context.For disambiguating confused symbols, a dynamic time-warping approach is proposed to automatically identify the parts of the online trace that discriminates between the confused classes. Fine classification of these regions by dedicated expert SVMs reduces the extent of confusions between such symbols. The integration of segmentation, prefix-tree-based language model and disambiguation of confused symbols is presented on a set of 15,000 handwritten isolated online Tamil words. Our results show recognition accuracies of 93.0% and 81.6% at the symbol and word level, respectively, as compared to the baseline classifier performance of 88.4% and 65.1%, respectively.", "authors": [{"name": "suresh sundaram", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435602003"}, {"name": "a g ramakrishnan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100289138"}], "title": "Bigram Language Models and Reevaluation Strategy for Improved Recognition of Online Handwritten Tamil Words", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "67\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "67\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "india", "university": "indian institute of technology guwahati", "affiliation_string": "indian institute of technology guwahati", "city": "guwahati", "Name": "suresh sundaram"}, {"country": "india", "university": "indian institute of science", "affiliation_string": "indian institute of science", "city": "bangalore", "Name": "a g ramakrishnan"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bimbot , Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bonastre , Corinne Fredouille , Guillaume Gravier , Ivan Magrin-Chagnolleau , Sylvain Meignier , Teva Merlin , Javier Ortega-Garc\u00eda , Dijana Petrovska-Delacr\u00e9taz , Douglas A.

Accent modeling of non-native speech is definitely challenging, because the acoustic properties in highly-accented speech pronounced by non-native speakers are quite divergent. The aim of this study is to generate highly Mandarin-accented English models for speakers whose mother tongue is Mandarin. First, a two-stage, state-based verification method is proposed to extract the state-level, highly-accented speech segments automatically. Acoustic features and articulatory features are successively used for robust verification of the extracted speech segments. Second, Gaussian components of the highly-accented speech models are generated from the corresponding Gaussian components of the native speech models using a linear transformation function. A decision tree is constructed to categorize the transformation functions and used for transformation function retrieval to deal with the data sparseness problem. Third, a discrimination function is further applied to verify the generated accented acoustic models. Finally, the successfully verified accented English models are integrated into the native bilingual phone model set for Mandarin-English bilingual speech recognition. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively alleviate recognition performance degradation due to accents and can obtain absolute improvements of 4.1%, 1.8%, and 2.7% in word accuracy for bilingual speech recognition compared to that using traditional ASR approaches, MAP-adapted, and MLLR-adapted ASR methods, respectively.", "authors": [{"name": "han-ping shen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81486641922"}, {"name": "chung-hsien wu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350591456"}, {"name": "pei-shan tsai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658709153"}], "title": "Model Generation of Accented Speech using Model Transformation and Verification for Bilingual Speech Recognition", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "120\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "120\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "taiwan", "university": "national cheng kung university", "affiliation_string": "national cheng kung university", "city": "tainan", "Name": "han-ping shen"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "national cheng kung university", "affiliation_string": "national cheng kung university", "city": "tainan", "Name": "chung-hsien wu"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "national cheng kung university", "affiliation_string": "national cheng kung university", "city": "tainan", "Name": "pei-shan tsai"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Imad A.

Although keywords are very useful for many applications, most documents available online are not provided with keywords. We describe a method for extracting keywords from Arabic documents. This method identifies the keywords by combining linguistics and statistical analysis of the text without using prior knowledge from its domain or information from any related corpus. The text is preprocessed to extract the main linguistic information, such as the roots and morphological patterns of derivative words. A cleaning phase is then applied to eliminate the meaningless words from the text. The most frequent terms are clustered into equivalence classes in which the derivative words generated from the same root and the non-derivative words generated from the same stem are placed together, and their count is accumulated. A vector space model is then used to capture the most frequent N-gram in the text. Experiments carried out using a real-world dataset show that the proposed method achieves good results with an average precision of 31% and average recall of 53% when tested against manually assigned keywords.", "authors": [{"name": "arafat awajan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81553816756"}], "title": "Keyword Extraction from Arabic Documents using Term Equivalence Classes", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "142\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "142\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "jordan", "university": "princess sumaya university for technology", "affiliation_string": "princess sumaya university for technology jordan", "city": "amman", "Name": "arafat awajan"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["Michael Auli, Michel Galley, Chris Quirk, and Geoffrey Zweig. 2013.

To express the translation quality, the previous lexical and phrasal probabilities are calculated only according to the co-occurrence statistics in the bilingual corpus and may be not reliable due to the data sparseness problem. To address this issue, we propose measuring the quality of the translation rules and their composition in the semantic vector embedding space (VES). We present a recursive neural network (RNN)-based translation framework, which includes two submodels. One is the bilingually-constrained recursive auto-encoder, which is proposed to convert the lexical translation rules into compact real-valued vectors in the semantic VES. The other is a type-dependent recursive neural network, which is proposed to perform the decoding process by minimizing the semantic gap (meaning distance) between the source language string and its translation candidates at each state in a bottom-up structure. The RNN-based translation model is trained using a max-margin objective function that maximizes the margin between the reference translation and the n-best translations in forced decoding. In the experiments, we first show that the proposed vector representations for the translation rules are very reliable for application in translation modeling. We further show that the proposed type-dependent, RNN-based model can significantly improve the translation quality in the large-scale, end-to-end Chinese-to-English translation evaluation.", "authors": [{"name": "jiajun zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442596939"}, {"name": "shujie liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442594834"}, {"name": "mu li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81423594290"}, {"name": "ming zhou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329493277"}, {"name": "chengqing zong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329493259"}], "title": "Towards Machine Translation in Semantic Vector Space", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "173\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "173\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "chinese academy of sciences", "city": null, "Name": "jiajun zhang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research asia", "city": null, "Name": "shujie liu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research asia", "city": null, "Name": "mu li"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research asia", "city": null, "Name": "ming zhou"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "chinese academy of sciences", "city": null, "Name": "chengqing zong"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2015"}}}, "Volume10": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Article No.: 19": {"references": ["Martin Braschler , Peter Sch\u00e4uble, Multilingual Information Retrieval Based on Document Alignment Techniques, Proceedings of the Second European Conference on Research and Advanced Technology for Digital Libraries, p.183-197, September 21-23, 1998\n", "Yufeng Chen , Chengqing Zong, A Structure-Based Model for Chinese Organization Name Translation, ACM Transactions on Asian Language Information Processing (TALIP), v.7 n.1, p.1-30, February 2008[doi>10.1145/1330291.1330292]\n", "Jenny Rose Finkel , Trond Grenager , Christopher Manning, Incorporating non-local information into information extraction systems by Gibbs sampling, Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics, p.363-370, June 25-30, 2005, Ann Arbor, Michigan[doi>10.3115/1219840.1219885]\n", "Pascale, F.1995a.

Since comparable corpora are more accessible, abundant and up-to-date, recent researches have concentrated on mining bilingual lexicons using comparable corpora. Leveraging comparable corpora, this research presents a novel approach to mining English-Chinese NE translations by combining multi-dimension features from various information sources for every possible NE pair, which include the transliteration model, English-Chinese matching, Chinese-English matching, translation model, length, and context vector. These features are integrated into one model with linear combination and minimum sample risk (MSR) algorithm. As for the high type-dependence of NE translation, we integrate different features according to different NE types. We experiment with the above individual feature or integrated features to mine person NE (PN) pairs, location NE (LN) pairs and organization NE (ON) pairs. When using transliteration and length to mine PN pairs, we achieve the best performance of 84.9&percnt; (F-score). The LN pairs can be mined with the features of transliteration model, length, translation model, English-Chinese matching and Chinese-English matching. And the best performance is 83.4&percnt; (F-score). The ON pairs can be mined with the features of English-Chinese matching and Chinese-English matching.

In this article, we focus on the Chinese (DE) construction which is flexible and ubiquitous in Chinese and has many different ways to be translated into English so that it is a major source of word order differences in terms of translation quality. This article carries out the Chinese \u201cDE\u201d construction study for Chinese--English SMT in which we propose a new classifier model---discriminative latent variable model (DPLVM)---with new features to improve the classification accuracy and indirectly improve the translation quality compared to a log-linear classifier. The DE classifier is used to recognize DE structures in both training and test sentences of Chinese, and then perform word reordering to make the Chinese sentences better match the word order of English. In order to investigate the impact of the DE classification and reordering in the source side on different types of SMT systems (namely PB-SMT, hierarchical PB-SMT (HPB-SMT) as well as the syntax-based SMT (SAMT)), we conduct a series of experiments on NIST 2005 and 2008 test sets to verify the effectiveness of our proposed model.

Motivated by the observation that two words are usually highly related to each other if they co-occur frequently in users\u2019 records, we propose a novel semantic relatedness measure between words that takes both user behaviors and collaborative filtering into consideration.

Due to the large amount of noise information involved in such corpora, it is still a problem to detect the answers even though the questions are exactly located. Quantifying the semantic relevance between questions and their candidate answers is essential to answer detection in social media corpora. Since both the questions and their answers usually contain a small number of sentences, the relevance modeling methods have to overcome the problem of word feature sparsity. In this article, the deep learning principle is introduced to address the semantic relevance modeling task. Two deep belief networks with different architectures are proposed by us to model the semantic relevance for the question-answer pairs. According to the investigation of the textual similarity between the community-driven question-answering (cQA) dataset and the forum dataset, a learning strategy is adopted to promote our models\u2019 performance on the social community corpora without hand-annotating work.

Results include high frequencies of pronoun errors and errors involving the copula in translations to English. High frequencies of errors in subject/person inflection and closed-word classes characterized translations to Iraqi Arabic. There were similar frequencies of word order errors in both translation directions and low frequencies of polarity errors. The problems associated with many errors can be predicted from structural differences between the two languages. Also problematic is the need to insert lexemes not present in the source or vice versa.

Because of the high error rate in spontaneous speech recognition, a combined acoustic model considering both syllable and subsyllable recognition units, is firstly used to determine the inter-syllable boundaries and output the recognition confidence of the input speech. Based on the finding that IPs always occur at inter-syllable boundaries, a probability distribution of the prosodic features at the current potential IP is estimated. The Conditional Random Field (CRF) model, which employs the clustered prosodic features of the current potential IP and its preceding and succeeding inter-syllable boundaries, is employed to output the IP likelihood measure. Finally, the confidence of the recognized speech, the probability distribution of the prosodic features and the CRF-based IP likelihood measure are integrated to determine the optimal IP sequence of the input spontaneous speech. In addition, pitch reset and lengthening are also applied to improve the IP detection performance. The Mandarin Conversional Dialogue Corpus is adopted for evaluation. Experimental results show that the proposed IP detection approach obtains 10.56&percnt; and 6.5&percnt; more effective results than the hidden Markov model and the Maximum Entropy model respectively under the same experimental conditions. Besides, the IP detection error rate can be further reduced by 9.15&percnt; using pitch reset and lengthening information. The experimental results confirm that the proposed model based on inter-syllable boundary-based prosodic features can effectively detect the interruption point in spontaneous Mandarin speech.", "authors": [{"name": "chung-hsien wu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350591456"}, {"name": "wei-bin liang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81482641414"}, {"name": "jui-feng yeh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81387605995"}], "title": "Interruption Point Detection of Spontaneous Speech Using Inter-Syllable Boundary-Based Prosodic Features", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "15\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "163\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "taiwan", "university": "national cheng kung university", "affiliation_string": "national cheng kung university", "city": "tainan", "Name": "chung-hsien wu"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "national cheng kung university", "affiliation_string": "national cheng kung university", "city": "tainan", "Name": "wei-bin liang"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "national chiayi university", "affiliation_string": "national chiayi university", "city": "jiayi", "Name": "jui-feng yeh"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Daniel M.

This work takes a new approach to this problem based on a distinction between the open-class and closed-class categories of tokens, which differ both in their frequencies and in their possible morphological affixations. This separation simplifies the morphological analysis problem considerably, making it possible to use a Conditional Random Field model for joint tokenization and \u201ccore\u201d part-of-speech tagging of the open-class items, while the closed-class items are handled by regular expressions. This work is therefore situated between data-driven approaches and those that use a morphological analyzer. For the tasks of tokenization and core part-of-speech tagging, the resulting system outperforms, on the given test set, a system that incorporates a morphological analyzer. We also evaluate the effects of the differences on parser performance when the tagger output is used for parser input.", "authors": [{"name": "seth kulick", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100607313"}], "title": "Exploiting Separation of Closed-Class Categories for Arabic Tokenization and Part-of-Speech Tagging", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "18\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "195\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of pennsylvania", "city": null, "Name": "seth kulick"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2011"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 15": {"references": ["ACE. 2002--2008.

The basic idea is to employ constituent dependency information in keeping the necessary nodes and their head children along the path connecting the two entities in the syntactic parse tree, while removing the noisy information from the tree, eventually leading to a dynamic syntactic parse tree. This article also explores various entity features and their possible combinations via a unified syntactic and semantic tree framework, which integrates both structural syntactic parse information and entity-related semantic information. Evaluation on the ACE RDC 2004 English and 2005 Chinese benchmark corpora shows that our dynamic syntactic parse tree much outperforms all previous tree spans, indicating its effectiveness in well representing the structural nature of relation instances while removing redundant information. Moreover, the unified parse and semantic tree significantly outperforms the single syntactic parse tree, largely due to the remarkable contributions from entity-related semantic features such as its type, subtype, mention-level as well as their bi-gram combinations. Finally, the best performance so far in semantic relation extraction is achieved via a composite kernel, which combines this tree kernel with a linear, state-of-the-art, feature-based kernel.", "authors": [{"name": "longhua qian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375609366"}, {"name": "guodong zhou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81408601310"}, {"name": "qiaoming zhu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100413928"}], "title": "Employing Constituent Dependency Information for Tree Kernel-Based Semantic Relation Extraction between Named Entities", "citations": [{"Name": "Boris A.

In contrast to the significant achievements on English language, research progress in Chinese relation extraction is relatively limited. In this article, we present a novel Chinese relation extraction framework, which is mainly based on a 9-position structure. The design of this proposed structure is motivated by the fact that there are some obvious connections between relation types/subtypes and position structures of two entities. The 9-position structure can be captured with less effort than applying deep natural language processing, and is effective to relieve the class imbalance problem which often hurts the classification performance. In our framework, all involved features do not require Chinese word segmentation, which has long been limiting the performance of Chinese language processing. We also utilize some correction and inference mechanisms to further improve the classified results. Experiments on the ACE 2005 Chinese data set show that the 9-position structure feature can provide strong support for Chinese relation extraction. As well as this, other strategies are also effective to further improve the performance.", "authors": [{"name": "peng zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81438594706"}, {"name": "wenjie li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100480838"}, {"name": "yuexian hou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418595623"}, {"name": "dawei song", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100578946"}], "title": "Developing Position Structure-Based Framework for Chinese Entity Relation Extraction", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "35\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "284\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "robert gordon university", "city": null, "Name": "peng zhang"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "polytechnic university", "affiliation_string": "the hong kong polytechnic university", "city": "sagamihara", "Name": "wenjie li"}, {"country": "china", "university": "tianjin university", "affiliation_string": "tianjin university", "city": "tianjin", "Name": "yuexian hou"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "robert gordon university", "city": null, "Name": "dawei song"}]}, "Article No.: 16": {"references": ["Arora, K., Paul, M., and Sumita, E.2008.

For some languages such as Chinese, we can obtain multiple constituency treebanks which are developed by different organizations. However, due to discrepancies of underlying annotation standards, such treebanks in general cannot be used together through direct data combination. To enlarge training data for syntactic parsing, we focus in this article on the challenge of unifying standards of disparate treebanks by automatically converting one treebank (source treebank) to fit a different standard which is exhibited by another treebank (target treebank).We propose to convert a treebank in two sequential steps which correspond to the part-of-speech level and syntactic structure level (including tree structures and grammar labels), respectively. Approaches used in both levels can be unified as aninformed decodingprocedure, where information derived from original annotation in a source treebank is used to guide the conversion conducted by a POS tagger (or a parser in the syntactic structure level) trained on a target treebank. We take two Chinese treebanks as a case study, and experiments on these two treebanks show significant improvements in conversion accuracy over baseline systems, especially in situations where a target treebank is small in size.", "authors": [{"name": "muhua zhu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323498928"}, {"name": "jingbo zhu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81447597341"}, {"name": "tong xiao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81470651288"}], "title": "Automatic Treebank Conversion via Informed Decoding - A Case Study on Chinese Treebanks", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "15\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "196\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "china", "university": "northeastern university", "affiliation_string": "northeastern university china", "city": "shenyang", "Name": "muhua zhu"}, {"country": "china", "university": "northeastern university", "affiliation_string": "northeastern university china", "city": "shenyang", "Name": "jingbo zhu"}, {"country": "china", "university": "northeastern university", "affiliation_string": "northeastern university china", "city": "shenyang", "Name": "tong xiao"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["Collin F.

Then we further improve the performance of nominal SRL with various kinds of verbal evidence, that is, merging the training instances from verbal predicates and integrating various kinds of features derived from SRL for verbal predicates. Finally, we address the issue of automatic predicate recognition, which is essential for nominal SRL. Evaluation on Chinese PropBank and Chinese NomBank shows that our unified approach significantly improves the performance, in particular that of nominal SRL.

We present an approach which is purely corpus based and finds the equivalence classes of variant words in an unsupervised manner.

Learning from mistakes is important not just in human learning activities; it is also a crucial ingredient in techniques for the developments of student models. In this article, we report findings of our study on 4,100 erroneous Chinese words. Seventy-six percent of these errors were related to the phonological similarity between the correct and the incorrect characters, 46&percnt; were due to visual similarity, and 29&percnt; involved both factors. We propose a computing algorithm that aims at replication of incorrect Chinese words. The algorithm extends the principles of decomposing Chinese characters with the Cangjie codes to judge the visual similarity between Chinese characters. The algorithm also employs empirical rules to determine the degree of similarity between Chinese phonemes. To show its effectiveness, we ran the algorithm to select and rank a list of about 100 candidate characters, from more than 5,100 characters, for the incorrectly written character in each of the 4,100 errors. We inspected whether the incorrect character was indeed included in the candidate list and analyzed whether the incorrect character was ranked at the top of the candidate list. Experimental results show that our algorithm captured 97&percnt; of incorrect characters for the 4,100 errors, when the average length of the candidate lists was 104. Further analyses showed that the incorrect characters ranked among the top 10 candidates in 89&percnt; of the phonologically similar errors and in 80&percnt; of the visually similar errors.", "authors": [{"name": "c-l liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100534776"}, {"name": "m-h lai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81458640626"}, {"name": "k-w tien", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81438592471"}, {"name": "y-h chuang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81438594863"}, {"name": "s-h wu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81501649501"}, {"name": "c-y lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81485646720"}], "title": "Visually and Phonologically Similar Characters in Incorrect Chinese Words: Analyses, Identification, and Applications", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "40\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "408\n", "Citation Count": "8\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "taiwan", "university": "national chengchi university", "affiliation_string": "national chengchi university", "city": "taibei", "Name": "c-l liu"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "national chengchi university", "affiliation_string": "national chengchi university", "city": "taibei", "Name": "m-h lai"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "national chengchi university", "affiliation_string": "national chengchi university", "city": "taibei", "Name": "k-w tien"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "national chengchi university", "affiliation_string": "national chengchi university", "city": "taibei", "Name": "y-h chuang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "chaoyang university of technology", "city": null, "Name": "s-h wu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "academia sinica", "city": null, "Name": "c-y lee"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Rakesh Agrawal , Tomasz Imieli\u0144ski , Arun Swami, Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases, ACM SIGMOD Record, v.22 n.2, p.207-216, June 1, 1993[doi>10.1145/170036.170072]\n", "Aubert, X. and Dugast, C.1995.

An unsupervised, incremental adaptation method is adopted for personalized model adaptation based on the recognized syllables with high recognition confidence from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. For articulation pattern discovery, the manually transcribed syllables and the corresponding recognized syllables are associated with each other using articulatory features. The Apriori algorithm is applied to discover the articulation patterns in the corpus, which are then used to construct a personalized pronunciation dictionary to improve the recognition accuracy of the ASR. The experimental results indicate that the proposed adaptation method achieves a syllable error rate reduction of 6.1&percnt;, outperforming the conventional adaptation methods that have a syllable error rate reduction of 3.8&percnt;.

Our underlying assumption is that the reliability of predictions of each classifier differs among the various named entity (NE) classes. Thus, it is necessary to quantify the amount of voting of a particular classifier for a particular output class. Here, an attempt is made to determine the appropriate weights of voting for each class in each classifier using GA. The proposed technique is evaluated for four leading Indian languages, namely Bengali, Hindi, Telugu, and Oriya, which are all resource-poor in nature. Evaluation results yield the recall, precision and F-measure values of 92.08&percnt;, 92.22&percnt;, and 92.15&percnt;, respectively for Bengali; 96.07&percnt;, 88.63&percnt;, and 92.20&percnt;, respectively for Hindi; 78.82&percnt;, 91.26&percnt;, and 84.59&percnt;, respectively for Telugu; and 88.56&percnt;, 89.98&percnt;, and 89.26&percnt;, respectively for Oriya. Finally, we evaluate our proposed approach with the benchmark dataset of CoNLL-2003 shared task that yields the overall recall, precision, andF-measure values of 88.72&percnt;, 88.64&percnt;, and 88.68&percnt;, respectively. Results also show that the vote based classifier ensemble identified by the GA-based approach outperforms all the individual classifiers, three conventional baseline ensembles, and some other existing ensemble techniques. In a part of the article, we formulate the problem of feature selection in any classifier under the single objective optimization framework and show that our proposed classifier ensemble attains superior performance to it.", "authors": [{"name": "asif ekbal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81322492671"}, {"name": "sriparna saha", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81321497389"}], "title": "Weighted Vote-Based Classifier Ensemble for Named Entity Recognition: A Genetic Algorithm-Based Approach", "citations": [{"Name": "Utpal Kumar Sikdar ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Asif Ekbal ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sriparna Saha", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Asif Ekbal ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sriparna Saha", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "95\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "516\n", "Citation Count": "7\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "india", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "indian institute of technology", "city": null, "Name": "asif ekbal"}, {"country": "india", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "indian institute of technology", "city": null, "Name": "sriparna saha"}]}}, "date": {"month": "June", "year": "2011"}}}, "Volume3": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Pages: 213-213": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/1039621.1039622", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "sung hyon myaeng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100045917"}], "title": "Introduction to the special issue on computer processing of oriental languages", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "7\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "496\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": []}, "Pages: 243-269": {"references": ["Androutsopoulos, I., Koutsias, J., Chandrinos, K., Paliouras, G., and Spyropoulos, C. 2000a.

We study the impact of different feature pruning methods and feature set sizes on each learner's performance using cost-sensitive measures. It is observed that the significance of feature selection varies greatly from classifier to classifier. In particular, we found support vector machine, AdaBoost, and maximum entropy model are top performers in this evaluation, sharing similar characteristics: not sensitive to feature selection strategy, easily scalable to very high feature dimension, and good performances across different datasets. In contrast, naive Bayes, a commonly used classifier in spam filtering, is found to be sensitive to feature selection methods on small feature set, and fails to function well in scenarios where false positives are penalized heavily. The experiments also suggest that aggressive feature pruning should be avoided when building filters to be used in applications where legitimate mails are assigned a cost much higher than spams (such as \u03bb = 999), so as to maintain a better-than-baseline performance. An interesting finding is the effect of mail headers on spam filtering, which is often ignored in previous studies. Experiments show that classifiers using features from message header alone can achieve comparable or better performance than filters utilizing body features only. This implies that message headers can be reliable and powerfully discriminative feature sources for spam filtering.", "authors": [{"name": "le zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100121560"}, {"name": "jingbo zhu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81546402156"}, {"name": "tianshun yao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81537896056"}], "title": "An evaluation of statistical spam filtering techniques", "citations": [{"Name": "Carlos Laorden ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Borja Sanz ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Igor Santos ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Patxi Gal\u00e1n-Garc\u00eda ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Pablo G.

To classify a new document, thek-nearest documents in the training set are determined first. The prediction of categories for this document can then be made according to the category distribution among theknearest neighbors. Generally speaking, the class distribution in a training set is not even; some classes may have more samples than others. The system's performance is very sensitive to the choice of the parameterk. And it is very likely that a fixedkvalue will result in a bias for large categories, and will not make full use of the information in the training set. To deal with these problems, an improved kNN strategy, in which different numbers of nearest neighbors for different categories are used instead of a fixed number across all categories, is proposed in this article. More samples (nearest neighbors) will be used to decide whether a test document should be classified in a category that has more samples in the training set. The numbers of nearest neighbors selected for different categories are adaptive to their sample size in the training set. Experiments on two different datasets show that our methods are less sensitive to the parameterkthan the traditional ones, and can properly classify documents belonging to smaller classes with a largek. The strategy is especially applicable and promising for cases where estimating the parameterkvia cross-validation is not possible and the class distribution of a training set is skewed.", "authors": [{"name": "li baoli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100476566"}, {"name": "lu qin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81538430756"}, {"name": "yu shiwen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100209788"}], "title": "An adaptivek-nearest neighbor text categorization strategy", "citations": [{"Name": "Ying Liu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Han Tong Loh ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Aixin Sun", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Imbalanced text classification: A term weighting approach", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Roman Tesar ", "Country": "netherlands", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Vaclav Strnad ", "Country": "netherlands", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Karel Jezek ", "Country": "netherlands", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Massimo Poesio", "Country": "netherlands", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tuan D.

In the topic detection and tracking (TDT) area, the temporal information often used is the publication date of a message, which is readily available but limited in its usefulness. We developed a relatively simple NLP method for extracting temporal information from Korean news articles, with the goal of improving performance of TDT tasks. To extract temporal information, we make use of finite state automata and a lexicon containing timerevealing vocabulary. Extracted information is converted into a canonicalized representation of a time point or a time duration. We first evaluated and investigated the extraction and canonicalization methods for their accuracy and the extent to which temporal information extracted as such can help TDT tasks.

Overall, the article shows that rote learning approaches can be very useful when language-specific features such as morphology are taken into account.", "authors": [{"name": "seok bae jang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100635177"}, {"name": "jennifer baldwin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81547383556"}, {"name": "inderjeet mani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100041710"}], "title": "Automatic TIMEX2 tagging of Korean news", "citations": [{"Name": "Xujian Zhao ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Peiquan Jin ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lihua Yue", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Automatic temporal expression normalization with reference time dynamic-choosing", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Seohyun Im ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hyunjo You ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hayun Jang ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Seungho Nam ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hyopil Shin", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wu Mingli ", "Country": "mali", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Li Wenjie ", "Country": "mali", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lu Qin ", "Country": "mali", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Li Baoli", "Country": "mali", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sheng Lin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Peiquan Jin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xujian Zhao ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lihua Yue", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Exploiting temporal information in Web search", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Pawe\u0142 Mazur ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Robert Dale", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xujian Zhao ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Peiquan Jin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lihua Yue", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Discovering topic time from web news", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "24\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "480\n", "Citation Count": "6\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "georgetown university", "city": null, "Name": "seok bae jang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "georgetown university", "city": null, "Name": "jennifer baldwin"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "georgetown university", "city": null, "Name": "inderjeet mani"}]}, "Pages: 1-10": {"references": ["Jan Alexandersson , Norbert Reithinger , Elisabeth Maier, Insights into the dialogue processing of VERBMOBIL, Proceedings of the fifth conference on Applied natural language processing, p.33-40, March 31-April 03, 1997, Washington, DC[doi>10.3115/974557.974564]\n", "James F.

Motivated by our study of temporal expressions from the Penn Treebank corpora, we address the problem by proposing a two-level constraint-based framework for processing and reasoning over temporal information in natural language. Within this framework, temporal expressions are viewed as partial assignments to the variables of an underlying calendar constraint system, and multiple expressions together describe a temporal constraint-satisfaction problem (TCSP). To support this framework, we designed a typed formal language for encoding natural language expressions. The language can cope with phenomena such as under-specification and granularity change. The constraint problems can be solved using various constraint propagation and search methods, and the solutions can then be used to answer a wide range of time-related queries.", "authors": [{"name": "benjamin han", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100051126"}, {"name": "alon lavie", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100546052"}], "title": "A framework for resolution of time in natural language", "citations": [{"Name": "Pawe\u0142 Mazur ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Robert Dale", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jyrki Niemi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kimmo Koskenniemi", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Representing and Combining Calendar Information by Using Finite-State Transducers", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Feng Pan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rutu Mulkar-Mehta ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jerry R.

The fundamental frequency (F0) is one of the most important components of speech prosody. This research investigates the variation of F0 in continuous Cantonese speech, with the goal of establishing an effective mechanism of prosody control in Cantonese text-to-speech (TTS) applications. Cantonese is a commonly used Chinese dialect that is well known for being rich in tones. This article describes a simple yet effective approach to the analysis and modeling of F0. The surface F0 contour of a continuous Cantonese utterance is considered to be the combination of a global component--phrase-level intonation curve, and local components--syllable-level tone contoursA novel method of F0 normalization is proposed to separate the local components from the global one. As a result, the variation in tone contours is greatly reduced. Statistical analysis is performed for the phrase curves and context-dependent tone contours that are extracted from a large corpus of 1,200 utterances. Specifically, the analysis is focused on co-articulated tone contours for disyllabic words, cross-word contours, and phrase-initial tone contours. Based on the results of the analysis, a template-based model for F0 generation is established and integrated with a Cantonese TTS system. Subjective listening tests show that the proposed model significantly improves the naturalness of the output speech.", "authors": [{"name": "yujia li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100484679"}, {"name": "tan lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100385050"}, {"name": "yao qian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81328489827"}], "title": "Analysis and modeling of F0 contours for cantonese text-to-speech", "citations": [{"Name": "Sudipta Acharya ", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shyamal Kr.

However, this kind of entity type information is often insufficient for machines to understand the facts contained in the texts, thus precluding the possibility of implementing more advanced, intelligent applications, such as concept-based search. In this work, we try to create more refined thematic metadata inherent in texts. Based on Web resource mining, our approach acquires training corpora necessary to describe both the thematic categories and the metadata extracted from the texts. The approach then finds the corresponding relationships among them by means of categorization and thus generates thematic metadata for the textual data. Experimental results confirm the potential and wide adaptability of our approach.", "authors": [{"name": "chien-chung huang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452605099"}, {"name": "shui-lung chuang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100637097"}, {"name": "lee-feng chien", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81450595233"}], "title": "Using a web-based categorization approach to generate thematic metadata from texts", "citations": [{"Name": "David Mimno ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alison Jones ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gregory Crane", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Maristella Agosti ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Franco Crivellari ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Giorgio Maria Di Nunzio", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiaoguang Qi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Brian D.

To further improve the discrimination capabilities of the HMMs, both the expectation-maximization (EM) and minimum classification error (MCE) training algorithms were introduced in training. Fusion of information via indexing word- and syllable-level features was also investigated. The spoken document retrieval experiments were performed on the Topic Detection and Tracking Corpora (TDT-2 and TDT-3).

All previous methods required a syntax parser before sentences could be reduced; hence it was difficult to apply them to a language with no reliable parser. In this article we propose two new sentence-reduction algorithms that do not use syntactic parsing for the input sentence. The first algorithm, based on the template-translation learning algorithm, one of example-based machine-translation methods, works quite well in reducing sentences, but its computational complexity can be exponential in certain cases. The second algorithm, an extension of the template--translation algorithm via innovative employment of the Hidden Markov model, which uses the set of template rules learned from examples, can overcome this computation problem. Experiments show that the proposed algorithms achieve acceptable results in comparison to sentence reduction done by humans.", "authors": [{"name": "minh le nguyen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100040394"}, {"name": "susumu horiguchi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100101996"}, {"name": "akira shimazu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100379238"}, {"name": "bao tu ho", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100316986"}], "title": "Example-based sentence reduction using the hidden markov model", "citations": [{"Name": "Seiji Egawa ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yoshihide Kato ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shigeki Matsubara", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sentence Compression by Removing Recursive Structure from Parse Tree", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "James Clarke ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mirella Lapata", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "15\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "667\n", "Citation Count": "5\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "japan", "university": "japan advanced institute of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "japan advanced institute of science and technology ishikawa japan", "city": "ishikawa", "Name": "minh le nguyen"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "tohoku university", "affiliation_string": "tohoku university ishikawa japan", "city": "sendai", "Name": "susumu horiguchi"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "japan advanced institute of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "japan advanced institute of science and technology ishikawa japan", "city": "ishikawa", "Name": "akira shimazu"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "japan advanced institute of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "japan advanced institute of science and technology ishikawa japan", "city": "ishikawa", "Name": "bao tu ho"}]}, "Pages: 94-112": {"references": ["Michael W.

Many natural language applications such as spoken-language understanding, machine translation, and information extraction, would benefit from, or even require, high accuracy parsing as a preprocessing step.Even though most state-of-the-art statistical parsers were initially constructed for parsing in English, most of them are not language-specific, in that they do not rely on properties of the language that are specific to English. Therefore, construction of a parser in a given language becomes a matter of retraining the statistical parameters with a Treebank in the corresponding language.The development of the Chinese treebank [Xia et al. 2000] spurred the construction of parsers for Chinese. However, Chinese as a language poses some unique problems for the development of a statistical parser, the most apparent being word segmentation. Since words in written Chinese are not delimited in the same way as in Western languages, the first problem that needs to be solved before an existing statistical method can be applied to Chinese is to identify the word boundaries. This is a step that is neglected by most pre-existing Chinese parsers, which assume that the input data has already been pre-segmented.This article describes a character-based statistical parser, which gives the best performance to-date on the Chinese treebank data. We augment an existing maximum entropy parser with transformation-based learning, creating a parser that can operate at the character level. We present experiments that show that our parser achieves results that are close to those achievable under perfect word segmentation conditions.", "authors": [{"name": "pascale fung", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100207745"}, {"name": "grace ngai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100430876"}, {"name": "yongsheng yang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100358644"}, {"name": "benfeng chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100108031"}], "title": "A maximum-entropy chinese parser augmented by transformation-based learning", "citations": [{"Name": "Dekai Wu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Pascale Fung", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Semantic roles for SMT: a hybrid two-pass model", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Proceedings of Human Language Technologies: The 2009 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zhongguo Li", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Parsing the internal structure of words: a new paradigm for Chinese word segmentation", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Samuel W.

The problem of unsupervised learning of a SCFG in General Format and in Chomsky Normal Form by means of estimation algorithms is studied. Moreover, a bracketed version of the classical estimation algorithm based on the Earley algorithm is proposed. This paper also explores the use of SCFGs obtained from a treebank corpus as initial models for the estimation algorithms. Experiments on the UPenn Treebank corpus are reported. These experiments have been carried out in terms of the test set perplexity and the word error rate in a speech recognition experiment.", "authors": [{"name": "diego linares", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100659139"}, {"name": "jose-miguel benedi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100545101"}, {"name": "joan-andreu sanchez", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100532872"}], "title": "A hybrid language model based on a combination ofN-grams and stochastic context-free grammars", "citations": [{"Name": "R.

We mathematically define fuzzy relations and the composition of these fuzzy relations for this extended version. We show that the concept of composition of fuzzy relations can be used to infer a relation between two words that otherwise are not directly related in Hindi WordNet. Then we propose fuzzy graph connectivity measures that include both local and global measures. These measures are used in determining the significance of a concept (which is represented as a vertex in the fuzzy graph) in a specific context. Finally, we show how these extended measures solve the problem of word sense disambiguation (WSD) effectively, which is useful in many natural language processing applications to improve their performance.

As comparable corpora are far more available, many studies have been conducted to extract either parallel sentences or fragments from them for SMT. In this article, we propose an integrated system to extract both parallel sentences and fragments from comparable corpora. We first apply parallel sentence extraction to identify parallel sentences from comparable sentences. We then extract parallel fragments from the comparable sentences. Parallel sentence extraction is based on a parallel sentence candidate filter and classifier for parallel sentence identification. We improve it by proposing a novel filtering strategy and three novel feature sets for classification. Previous studies have found it difficult to accurately extract parallel fragments from comparable sentences. We propose an accurate parallel fragment extraction method that uses an alignment model to locate the parallel fragment candidates and an accurate lexicon-based filter to identify the truly parallel fragments. A case study on the Chinese--Japanese Wikipedia indicates that our proposed methods outperform previously proposed methods, and the parallel data extracted by our system significantly improves SMT performance.", "authors": [{"name": "chenhui chu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83358850457"}, {"name": "toshiaki nakazawa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81443592405"}, {"name": "sadao kurohashi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100374659"}], "title": "Integrated Parallel Sentence and Fragment Extraction from Comparable Corpora: A Case Study on Chinese--Japanese Wikipedia", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "38\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "38\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "japan science and technology agency honcho kawaguchi-shi saitama japan", "city": "saitama", "Name": "chenhui chu"}, {"country": "Japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "japan science and technology agency honcho kawaguchi-shi saitama japan", "city": "saitama", "Name": "toshiaki nakazawa"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "kyoto university", "affiliation_string": "kyoto university sakyo-ku kyoto japan", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "sadao kurohashi"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Guihong Cao, Jianfeng Gao, Jian-Yun Nie, and W.

Parenthetical translations extraction (PTE) is the task of extracting parenthetical translations from natural language documents. One of the main difficulties in PTE is to detect the left boundary of the translated term in preparenthetical text. In this article, we propose a collective approach that employs Markov logic to model multiple constraints used in the PTE task. We show how various constraints can be formulated and combined in a Markov logic network (MLN). Our experimental results show that the proposed collective PTE approach significantly outperforms a current state-of-the-art method, improving the average F-measure up to 27.11&percnt; compared to the previous word alignment approach.

However, conventional search engines consider a search query corresponding only to a simple search task. In order to accomplish a complex search task, which consists of multiple subtask search goals, users usually have to issue a series of queries. For example, the complex search task \u201ctravel to Dubai\u201d may involve several subtask search goals, including reserving hotel room, surveying Dubai landmarks, booking flights, and so forth. Therefore, a user can efficiently accomplish his or her complex search task if search engines can predict the complex search task with a variety of subtask search goals. In this work, we propose a complex search task model (CSTM) to deal with this problem. The CSTM first groups queries into complex search task clusters, and then generates subtask search goals from each complex search task cluster. To raise the performance of CSTM, we exploit four web resources including community question answering, query logs, search engine result pages, and clicked pages. Experimental results show that our CSTM is effective in identifying the comprehensive subtask search goals of a complex search task.", "authors": [{"name": "ting-xuan wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658949856"}, {"name": "wen-hsiang lu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100052538"}], "title": "Constructing Complex Search Tasks with Coherent Subtask Search Goals", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "109\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "11\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "109\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "taiwan", "university": "national cheng kung university", "affiliation_string": "department of computer science and information engineering national cheng kung university", "city": "tainan", "Name": "ting-xuan wang"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "national cheng kung university", "affiliation_string": "department of computer science and information engineering national cheng kung university", "city": "tainan", "Name": "wen-hsiang lu"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["L.

Previous studies show that many acoustic cues are attributed to shapes of tones. Nevertheless, most Thai tone classification studies mainly adopted F0values and their derivatives without considering other acoustic features. In this article, other acoustic features for Thai tone classification are investigated. In the experiment, energy values and spectral information represented by three spectral-based features including the LPC-based feature, PLP-based feature, and MFCC-based feature are applied to the HCRF-based Thai tone classification, which was reported as the best approach for Thai tone classification. The energy values provide an error rate reduction of 22.40&percnt; in the isolated word scenario, while there are slight improvements in the continuous speech scenario. On the contrary, spectral-based features greatly contribute to Thai tone classification in the continuous-speech scenario, whereas spectral-based features slightly degrade performances in the isolated-word scenario. The best achievement in the continuous-speech scenario is obtained from the PLP-based feature, which yields an error rate reduction of 13.90&percnt;. Therefore, findings in this article are that energy values and spectral-based features, especially the PLP-based feature, are the main contributors to the improvement of the performances of Thai tone classification in the isolated-word scenario and the continuous-speech scenario, respectively.", "authors": [{"name": "natthawut kertkeidkachorn", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82258752657"}, {"name": "proadpran punyabukkana", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81341495356"}, {"name": "atiwong suchato", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100289004"}], "title": "Acoustic Features for Hidden Conditional Random Fields--Based Thai Tone Classification", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "25\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "25\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "thailand", "university": "chulalongkorn university", "affiliation_string": "chulalongkorn university bangkok thailand", "city": "bangkok", "Name": "natthawut kertkeidkachorn"}, {"country": "thailand", "university": "chulalongkorn university", "affiliation_string": "chulalongkorn university bangkok thailand", "city": "bangkok", "Name": "proadpran punyabukkana"}, {"country": "thailand", "university": "chulalongkorn university", "affiliation_string": "chulalongkorn university bangkok thailand", "city": "bangkok", "Name": "atiwong suchato"}]}}, "date": {"month": "February", "year": "2016"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 2": {"references": ["R.

As a preprocessing step, skeletonization of the character is performed using an iterative thinning algorithm based on Raster scan of the character image. Then, a combination of structural features of the character like number of endpoints, loops, and intersection points is calculated. Further, the thinned character image is statistically zoned into partitions, and a quadratic curve-fitting model is applied on each partition forming a feature vector of the coefficients of the optimally fitted curve. This vector is combined with the spatial distribution of the foreground pixels for each zone and hence script-independent feature representation.

The use of synthetic data for training and testing handwritten character recognition systems is one of the possible solutions to provide several variations for these characters and to overcome the lack of large databases. While this can be using arbitrary distortions, such as image noise and randomized affine transformations, such distortions are not realistic. In this work, we model real distortions in handwriting using real handwritten Arabic character examples and then use these distortion models to synthesize handwritten examples that are more realistic. We show that the use of our proposed approach leads to significant improvements across different machine-learning classification algorithms.", "authors": [{"name": "maad shatnawi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502776895"}, {"name": "sherief abdallah", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100192630"}], "title": "Improving Handwritten Arabic Character Recognition by Modeling Human Handwriting Distortions", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "36\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "36\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united arab emirates", "university": "united arab emirates university", "affiliation_string": "united arab emirates university abu dhabi uae", "city": "al ayn", "Name": "maad shatnawi"}, {"country": "united arab emirates", "university": "british university in dubai", "affiliation_string": "the british university in dubai dubai uae", "city": "dubai", "Name": "sherief abdallah"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["Carme Armentano-Oller , Rafael C.

We describe a hybrid method for constructing this system taking advantage of available resources such as parallel corpora that are used to extract dictionaries and lexical and structural transfer rules.The final system is freely available online and open source. Although performance lags behind standard SMT systems for an in-domain test set, the results show that the RBMT\u2019s coverage is competitive and it outperforms the SMT system in an out-of-domain test set. This RBMT system is available to the general public, it can be further enhanced, and it opens up the possibility of creating future hybrid MT systems.", "authors": [{"name": "marta r costa-jussa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330489587"}, {"name": "jordi centelles", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658708636"}], "title": "Description of the Chinese-to-Spanish Rule-Based Machine Translation System Developed Using a Hybrid Combination of Human Annotation and Statistical Techniques", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "41\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "41\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universitat politecnica de catalunya barcelona", "city": null, "Name": "marta r costa-jussa"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universitat politecnica de catalunya barcelona", "city": null, "Name": "jordi centelles"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Kisuh Ahn , Matthew Frampton, Automatic generation of translation dictionaries using intermediary languages, Proceedings of the International Workshop on Cross-Language Knowledge Induction, p.41-44, April 03-03, 2006, Trento, Italy\n", "Fadi A.

Using a third language to link two other languages is a well-known solution and usually requires only two input bilingual dictionariesA-BandB-Cto automatically induce the new one,A-C. This approach, however, has never been demonstrated to utilize the complete structures of the input bilingual dictionaries, and this is a key failing because the dropped meanings negatively influence the result. This article proposes a constraint approach to pivot-based dictionary induction where languageAandCare closely related. We create constraints from language similarity and model the structures of the input dictionaries as a Boolean optimization problem, which is then formulated within the Weighted Partial Max-SAT framework, an extension of Boolean Satisfiability (SAT). All of the encoded CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form), the predominant input language of modern SAT/MAX-SAT solvers, formulas are evaluated by a solver to produce the target (output) bilingual dictionary. Moreover, we discuss alternative formalizations as a comparison study. We designed a tool that uses the Sat4j library as the default solver to implement our method and conducted an experiment in which the output bilingual dictionary achieved better quality than the baseline method.", "authors": [{"name": "mairidan wushouer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84459327757"}, {"name": "donghui lin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81554493556"}, {"name": "toru ishida", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330492654"}, {"name": "katsutoshi hirayama", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100282147"}], "title": "A Constraint Approach to Pivot-Based Bilingual Dictionary Induction", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "37\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "37\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "japan", "university": "kyoto university", "affiliation_string": "department of social informatics kyoto university", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "mairidan wushouer"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "kyoto university", "affiliation_string": "department of social informatics kyoto university", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "donghui lin"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "kyoto university", "affiliation_string": "department of social informatics kyoto university", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "toru ishida"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "kobe university", "affiliation_string": "graduate school of maritime sciences kobe university", "city": "kobe", "Name": "katsutoshi hirayama"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Andreas Peldszus , Timo Baumann , Okko Bu\u00df , David Schlangen, Joint satisfaction of syntactic and pragmatic constraints improves incremental spoken language understanding, Proceedings of the 13th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, April 23-27, 2012, Avignon, France\n", "Andreas Stolcke , Noah Coccaro , Rebecca Bates , Paul Taylor , Carol Van Ess-Dykema , Klaus Ries , Elizabeth Shriberg , Daniel Jurafsky , Rachel Martin , Marie Meteer, Dialogue act modeling for automatic tagging and recognition of conversational speech, Computational Linguistics, v.26 n.3, p.339-373, September 2000[doi>10.1162/089120100561737]\n", "Ashequl Qadir , Ellen Riloff, Classifying sentences as speech acts in message board posts, Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, July 27-31, 2011, Edinburgh, United Kingdom\n", "John Langshaw Austin. 1962.

The semantic dependency graph based on the HowNet knowledge base is adopted to model the relationships between words in an utterance parsed by PCFG. Dependency relationships between words within the utterance are extracted by decomposing the semantic dependency graph according to predefined events. The corresponding values of semantic slots are subsequently extracted from the speaker's utterances according to the corresponding identified speech act. The experimental results obtained when using the proposed approach indicated that the accuracy rates of speech act detection and task completion were 95.6&percnt; and 77.4&percnt; for human-generated transcription (REF) and speech-to-text recognition output (STT), respectively, and the average numbers of turns of each dialogue were 8.3 and 11.8 for REF and STT, respectively.

However, state-of-the-art neural network LMs usually use words before the current position as context and neglect global topic information, which can help machine translation (MT) systems to select better translation candidates from a higher perspective. In this work, we propose improvement of the state-of-the-art feedforward neural language model with topic information. Two main issues need to be tackled when adding topics into neural network LMs for SMT: one is how to incorporate topics to the neural network; the other is how to get target-side topic distribution before translation. We incorporate topics by appending topic distribution to the input layer of a feedforward LM. We adopt a multinomial logistic-regression (MLR) model to predict the target-side topic distribution based on source side information. Moreover, we propose a feedforward neural network model to learn joint representations on the source side for topic prediction. LM experiments demonstrate that the perplexity on validation set can be greatly reduced by the topic-enhanced feedforward LM, and the prediction of target-side topics can be improved dramatically with the MLR model equipped with the joint source representations. A final MT experiment, conducted on a large-scale Chinese--English dataset, shows that our feedforward LM with predicted topics improves the translation performance against a strong baseline.", "authors": [{"name": "yinggong zhao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81472651613"}, {"name": "shujian huang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658744320"}, {"name": "xin-yu dai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658752521"}, {"name": "jiajun chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81438594955"}], "title": "Adaptation of Language Models for SMT Using Neural Networks with Topic Information", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "42\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "26\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "42\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "china", "university": "nanjing university", "affiliation_string": "state key laboratory for novel software technology nanjing university nanjing china", "city": "nanjing", "Name": "yinggong zhao"}, {"country": "china", "university": "nanjing university", "affiliation_string": "state key laboratory for novel software technology nanjing university nanjing china", "city": "nanjing", "Name": "shujian huang"}, {"country": "china", "university": "nanjing university", "affiliation_string": "state key laboratory for novel software technology nanjing university nanjing china", "city": "nanjing", "Name": "xin-yu dai"}, {"country": "china", "university": "nanjing university", "affiliation_string": "state key laboratory for novel software technology nanjing university nanjing china", "city": "nanjing", "Name": "jiajun chen"}]}, "Article No.: 15": {"references": ["Stephen Boyd and Almir Mutapcic. 2003.

Since rich bilingual information is encoded, bilingual SRL has been applied in many natural-language processing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation (MT), cross-lingual information retrieval (IR), and the like. A feasible way of performing bilingual SRL is using monolingual SRL systems to perform SRL on each side of bi-texts separately. However, it is difficult to obtain consistent SRL results on both sides of bi-texts in this way. Some works have tried to jointly infer bilingual SRL because there are many complementary language cues on both sides of bi-texts and they reported better performance than monolingual systems. However, there are two limits in the existing methods. First, the existing methods often require high inference costs due to the complex objective function. Second, the existing methods fully adopt the candidates generated by monolingual SRL systems, but many candidates are discarded in the argument pruning or identification stage of monolingual systems. In this article, we propose two strategies to overcome these limits. We utilize a simple but efficient technique: Dual Decomposition to search for consistent results for both sides of bi-texts. On the other hand, we propose a method called Bi-Directional Projection (BDP) to recover arguments discarded in monolingual SRL systems.We evaluate our method on a standard parallel benchmark: the OntoNotes dataset. The experimental results show that our method yields significant improvements over the state-of-the-art monolingual systems. In addition, our approach is also better and faster than existing methods due to BDP and Dual Decomposition.", "authors": [{"name": "haitong yang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658969529"}, {"name": "yu zhou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81472651139"}, {"name": "chengqing zong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329493259"}], "title": "Bilingual Semantic Role Labeling Inference via Dual Decomposition", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "24\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "13\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "24\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national laboratory of pattern recognition institute of automation chinese academy of sciences", "city": null, "Name": "haitong yang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national laboratory of pattern recognition institute of automation chinese academy of sciences", "city": null, "Name": "yu zhou"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national laboratory of pattern recognition institute of automation chinese academy of sciences", "city": null, "Name": "chengqing zong"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Lahsen Abouenour, Karim Bouzoubaa, and Paolo Rosso. 2013.

Automatic detection ofCausalrelations therefore has gained popularity in the literature within different frameworks. The aim of this article is the automatic detection and extraction ofCausalrelations that are explicitly expressed in Arabic texts. To fulfill this goal, aPattern Recognizermodel was developed to signal the presence of cause--effect information within sentences from nonspecific domain texts. This model incorporates approximately 700 linguistic patterns so that parts of the sentence representing thecauseand those representing theeffectcan be distinguished. The patterns were constructed based on different sets of syntactic features by analyzing a large untagged Arabic corpus. In addition, the model was boosted with three independent algorithms to deal with certain types of grammatical particles that indicate causation. With this approach, the proposed model achieved an overallrecallof 81&percnt; and aprecisionof 78&percnt;. Evaluation results revealed that the justification particles play a key role in detectingCausalrelations.

Most existing evaluation metrics rely on matching the same word or lettern-grams. This strategy leads to poor results on Chinese translations because one has to rely merely on matching identical characters. In this article, we propose a new evaluation metric that allows different characters with the same or similar meaning to match. An Indirect Hidden Markov Model (IHMM) is proposed to align the Chinese translation with human references at the character level. In the model, the emission probabilities are estimated by character similarity, including character semantic similarity and character surface similarity, and transition probabilities are estimated by a heuristic distance-based distortion model. When evaluating the submitted output of English-to-Chinese translation systems in the IWSLT\u201908 CT-EC and NIST\u201908 EC tasks, the experimental results indicate that the proposed metric has a significantly better correlation with human evaluation than the state-of-the-art machine translation metrics (i.e., BLEU, Meteor Universal, and TESLA-CELAB).

Its effectiveness for word sense disambiguation (WSD) is also investigated. One of the key challenges for computer processing of highly inflected languages is to deal with the frequent morphological variations of the root words appearing in the text. Therefore, a lemmatizer is essential for developing natural language processing (NLP) tools for such languages. In this experiment, Bengali, which is the national language of Bangladesh and the second most popular language in the Indian subcontinent, has been taken as a reference. In order to design the Bengali lemmatizer (named as BenLem), possible transformations through which surface words are formed from lemmas are studied so that appropriate reverse transformations can be applied on a surface word to get the corresponding lemma back. BenLem is found to be capable of handling both inflectional and derivational morphology in Bengali. It is evaluated on a set of 18 news articles taken from the FIRE Bengali News Corpus consisting of 3,342 surface words (excluding proper nouns) and found to be 81.95&percnt; accurate. The role of the lemmatizer is then investigated for Bengali WSD. Ten highly polysemous Bengali words are considered for sense disambiguation. The FIRE corpus and a collection of Tagore\u2019s short stories are considered for creating the WSD dataset. Different WSD systems are considered for this experiment, and it is noticed that BenLem improves the performance of all the WSD systems and the improvements are statistically significant.", "authors": [{"name": "abhisek chakrabarty", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658987509"}, {"name": "utpal garain", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100258907"}], "title": "BenLem (A Bengali Lemmatizer) and Its Role in WSD", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "15\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "15\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "15\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "india", "university": "indian statistical institute", "affiliation_string": "indian statistical institute kolkata india", "city": "calcutta", "Name": "abhisek chakrabarty"}, {"country": "india", "university": "indian statistical institute", "affiliation_string": "indian statistical institute kolkata india", "city": "calcutta", "Name": "utpal garain"}]}, "Article No.: 20": {"references": ["Yaser Al-Onaizan , Kishore Papineni, Distortion models for statistical machine translation, Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Computational Linguistics and the 44th annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, p.529-536, July 17-18, 2006, Sydney, Australia[doi>10.3115/1220175.1220242]\n", "David Chiang, Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation, Computational Linguistics, v.33 n.2, p.201-228, June 2007[doi>10.1162/coli.2007.33.2.201]\n", "Chenchen Ding, Takashi Inui, and Mikio Yamamoto. 2011.

A Japanese sentence is pre-ordered to an English-like order at the morpheme level for a statistical machine translation system during the training and decoding phase to resolve the reordering problem. In this article,extra-chunkpre-ordering of morphemes is proposed, which allows Japanese functional morphemes to move across chunk boundaries. This contrasts with the intra-chunk reordering used in previous approaches, which restricts the reordering of morphemes within a chunk. Linguistically oriented discussions show that correct pre-ordering cannot be realized without extra-chunk movement of morphemes. The proposed approach is compared with five rule-based pre-ordering approaches designed for Japanese-to-English translation and with a language independent statistical pre-ordering approach on a standard patent dataset and on a news dataset obtained by crawling Internet news sites. Two state-of-the-art statistical machine translation systems, one phrase-based and the other hierarchical phrase-based, are used in experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the compared approaches on automatic reordering measures (Kendall\u2019s \u03c4, Spearman\u2019s \u03c1, fuzzy reordering score, and test set RIBES) and on the automatic translation precision measure of test set BLEU score.", "authors": [{"name": "chenchen ding", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658969276"}, {"name": "keisuke sakanushi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658970013"}, {"name": "hirona touji", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658970057"}, {"name": "mikio yamamoto", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100600749"}], "title": "Inter-, Intra-, and Extra-Chunk Pre-Ordering for Statistical Japanese-to-English Machine Translation", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "32\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "15\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "32\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of tsukuba", "city": null, "Name": "chenchen ding"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of tsukuba", "city": null, "Name": "keisuke sakanushi"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of tsukuba", "city": null, "Name": "hirona touji"}, {"country": "Japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of tsukuba ibaraki japan", "city": "tsukuba", "Name": "mikio yamamoto"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["Daniel M.

Furthermore, a Bilingual LM Pruning (BLMP) approach is developed for enhancing LMs in SMT decoding and speeding up CSLM converting. The proposed pruning and converting methods can convert a large LM efficiently by working jointly. That is, a LM can be effectively pruned before it is converted from CSLM without sacrificing performance, and further improved if an additional corpus contains out-of-domain information. For different SMT tasks, our experimental results indicate that the proposed NNGC and BLMP methods outperform the existing counterpart approaches significantly in BLEU and computational cost.", "authors": [{"name": "rui wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658738882"}, {"name": "masao utiyama", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100491189"}, {"name": "isao goto", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323490532"}, {"name": "eiichiro sumita", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81328490654"}, {"name": "hai zhao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418598197"}, {"name": "bao-liang lu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100052708"}], "title": "Converting Continuous-Space Language Models intoN-gram Language Models with Efficient Bilingual Pruning for Statistical Machine Translation", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "137\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "65\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "137\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Kyrgyzstan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "shanghai jiao tong university shanghai china", "city": "tong", "Name": "rui wang"}, {"country": "Japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of information and communications technology kyoto japan", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "masao utiyama"}, {"country": "Japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "nhk and national institute of information and communications technology tokyo japan", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "isao goto"}, {"country": "Japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of information and communications technology kyoto japan", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "eiichiro sumita"}, {"country": "Kyrgyzstan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "shanghai jiao tong university shanghai china", "city": "tong", "Name": "hai zhao"}, {"country": "Kyrgyzstan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "shanghai jiao tong university shanghai china", "city": "tong", "Name": "bao-liang lu"}]}, "Article No.: 18": {"references": ["M.

expressed in another language. As CLIR tools rely on translation techniques, they are challenged by the properties of highly derivational and flexional languages like Arabic. Much work has been done on CLIR for different languages including Arabic. In this article, we introduce the reader to the motivations for solving some problems related to Arabic CLIR approaches. The evaluation of these approaches is discussed starting from the 2001 and 2002 TREC Arabic CLIR tracks, which aim to objectively evaluate CLIR systems. We also study many other research works to highlight the unresolved problems or those that require further investigation. These works are discussed in the light of a deep study of the specificities and the tasks of Arabic information retrieval (IR). Particular attention is given to translation techniques and CLIR resources, which are key issues challenging Arabic CLIR. To push research in this field, we discuss how a new standard collection can improve Arabic IR and CLIR tracks.", "authors": [{"name": "bilel elayeb", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81470652867"}, {"name": "ibrahim bounhas", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81470655787"}], "title": "Arabic Cross-Language Information Retrieval: A Review", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "51\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "41\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "51\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "bilel elayeb"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "ibrahim bounhas"}]}, "Article No.: 17": {"references": ["D.

The experiments included five commonly used similarity and distance functions (Pearson correlation coefficient, cosine, Jaccard coefficient, Euclidean distance, and averaged Kullback-Leibler divergence) and three leading stemmers. Using the purity measure, the bisect K-means clearly outperformed the standard K-means in all settings with varying margins. For the bisect K-means, the best purity reached 0.927 when using the Pearson correlation coefficient function, while for the standard K-means, the best purity reached 0.884 when using the Jaccard coefficient function. Removing stop words significantly improved the results of the bisect K-means but produced minor improvements in the results of the standard K-means. Stemming provided additional minor improvement in all settings except the combination of the averaged Kullback-Leibler divergence function and the root-based stemmer, where the purity was deteriorated by more than 10&percnt;.

This is one of the basic and important pieces of knowledge in natural language processing and has been used for syntactic and word sense disambiguation. In the case of acquiring the selectional restriction for many combinations of words from a corpus, it is necessary to estimate whether or not a word combination that is not observed in the corpus satisfies the selectional restriction. This paper proposes a new method for estimating the degree of satisfaction of the selectional restriction for a word combination from a tagged corpus, based on the multiple regression model. The independent variables of this model correspond to modifiers. Unlike a conventional multiple regression analysis, the independent variables are also parameters to be learned. We experiment on estimating the degree of satisfaction of the selectional restriction for Japanese word combinations \u2329noun, postpositional-particle, verb\u232a. The experimental results indicate that our method estimates the degree of satisfaction of a word combination not very well observed in the corpus, and that the accuracy of syntactic disambiguation using the co-occurrencies estimated by our method is higher than using co-occurrence probabilities smoothed by previous methods.", "authors": [{"name": "yoichi tomiura", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309484206"}, {"name": "shosaku tanaka", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309485882"}, {"name": "toru hitaka", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309488088"}], "title": "Estimating satisfactoriness of selectional restriction from corpus without a thesaurus", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "9\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "268\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "japan", "university": "kyushu university", "affiliation_string": "kyushu university fukuoka japan", "city": "fukuoka", "Name": "yoichi tomiura"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "ritsumeikan university", "affiliation_string": "ritsumeikan university kyoto japan", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "shosaku tanaka"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "kyushu university", "affiliation_string": "kyushu university retired march 2003", "city": "fukuoka", "Name": "toru hitaka"}]}, "Pages: 377-399": {"references": ["Baldwin, T. and Tanaka, H. 2001.

Such a system, however, suffers from the problem of narrow coverage. To reduce the problem, a large-scale parallel corpus is required and, therefore, an efficient method is needed to retrieve translation examples from a large-scale corpus. The authors propose an efficient retrieval method for a sentence-wise EBMT using edit-distance. The proposed retrieval method efficiently retrieves the most similar sentences using the measure of edit-distance without omissions. The proposed method employs search-space division, word graphs, and an A&ast; search algorithm. The performance of the EBMT was evaluated through Japanese-to-English translation experiments using a bilingual corpus comprising hundreds of thousands of sentences from a travel conversation domain. The EBMT system achieved a high-quality translation ability by using a large corpus and also achieved efficient processing by using the proposed retrieval method.", "authors": [{"name": "takao doi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100266556"}, {"name": "hirofumi yamamoto", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329493102"}, {"name": "eiichiro sumita", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81328490654"}], "title": "Example-based machine translation using efficient sentence retrieval based on edit-distance", "citations": [{"Name": "David E.

A causal relation is the relation existing between two events such that one event causes (or enables) the other event, such as \u201chard rain causes flooding\u201d or \u201ctaking a train requires buying a ticket.\u201d In previous work these relations have been classified into several types based on a variety of points of view. In this work, we consider four types of causal relations---cause,effect,precond(ition)andmeans---mainly based on agents' volitionality, as proposed in the research field of discourse understanding. The idea behind knowledge acquisition is to use resultative connective markers, such as \u201cbecause,\u201d \u201cbut,\u201d and \u201cif\u201d as linguistic cues. However, there is no guarantee that a given connective marker always signals the same type of causal relation. Therefore, we need to create a computational model that is able to classify samples according to the causal relation. To examine how accurately we can automatically acquire causal knowledge, we attempted an experiment using Japanese newspaper articles, focusing on the resultative connective \u201ctame.\u201d By using machine-learning techniques, we achieved 80&percnt; recall with over 95&percnt; precision for thecause,precond, andmeansrelations, and 30&percnt; recall with 90&percnt; precision for theeffectrelation. Furthermore, the classification results suggest that one can expect to acquire over 27,000 instances of causal relations from 1 year of Japanese newspaper articles.", "authors": [{"name": "takashi inui", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323491062"}, {"name": "kentaro inui", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329489552"}, {"name": "yuji matsumoto", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100316381"}], "title": "Acquiring causal knowledge from text using the connective markertame", "citations": [{"Name": "Rutu Mulkar-Mehta", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rutu Mulkar-Mehta", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Koji Murakami ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Eric Nichols ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Suguru Matsuyoshi ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Asuka Sumida ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shouko Masuda ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kentaro Inui ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yuji Matumoto", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yuen-Hsien Tseng ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zih-Ping Ho ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kai-Sheng Yang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chun-Cheng Chen", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mining term networks from text collections for crime investigation", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "12\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "705\n", "Citation Count": "9\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "research fellow of the japan society for the promotion of science yamato japan", "city": "japan", "Name": "takashi inui"}, {"country": "austria", "university": "institute of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "school of information science nara institute of science and technology nara japan", "city": "klosterneuburg", "Name": "kentaro inui"}, {"country": "austria", "university": "institute of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "school of information science nara institute of science and technology nara japan", "city": "klosterneuburg", "Name": "yuji matsumoto"}]}, "Pages: 475-503": {"references": ["James Allan , Ron Papka , Victor Lavrenko, On-line new event detection and tracking, Proceedings of the 21st annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval, p.37-45, August 24-28, 1998, Melbourne, Australia[doi>10.1145/290941.290954]\n", "ChaSen. 2005. http://chasen.aist-nara.ac.jp/index.html.en.\n", "Digital Video Broadcasting Project. 2003. http://www.dvb.org.\n", "Google Web APIs. 2005. http://www.google.com/apis/.\n", "Sudipto Guha , H.

With advances in the availability of information, information-seeking activities are becoming more sophisticated. This means that information technology must move to the next stage, i.e., enable users to acquire information from multiple perspectives to satisfy diverse needs. For instance, with the spread of digital broadcasting and broadband Internet connection services, infrastructure for the integration of TV programs and the Internet has been developed that enables users to acquire information from different media at the same time to improve information quality and the level of detail. In this paper, we propose a novel content-based join model for data streams (closed captions of videos or TV programs) and Web pages based on the concept of topic structures. We then propose a mechanism based on this model for retrieving complementary Web pages to augment the content of video or television programs. One of the most notable features of this complementary retrieval mechanism is that the retrieved information is not just similar to the video or TV program, but also provides additional information. In addition, we introduce an application system called WebTelop, which augments the content of TV programs in real time by using complementary Web pages. We also describe some experimental results.", "authors": [{"name": "qiang ma", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100447194"}, {"name": "katsumi tanaka", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100134378"}], "title": "Topic-structure-based complementary information retrieval and its application", "citations": [{"Name": "Qiang Ma ", "Country": "thailand", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hisashi Miyamori ", "Country": "thailand", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Katsumi Tanaka", "Country": "thailand", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Content augmentation and webification for enhancing TV viewing", "Country": "thailand", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Damien Eklou ", "Country": "malaysia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yasuhito Asano ", "Country": "malaysia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Masatoshi Yoshikawa", "Country": "malaysia", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "16\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "677\n", "Citation Count": "8\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of information and communications technology kyoto japan", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "qiang ma"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "kyoto university", "affiliation_string": "national institute of information and communications technology graduate school of informatics kyoto university kyoto japan", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "katsumi tanaka"}]}}, "date": {"month": "December", "year": "2005"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Pages: 18-37": {"references": ["Abney, S., Schapire, R.

However, tagged corpora contain errors, which impedes the progress of research. Therefore, the correction of errors in corpora is an important research issue. In this study we investigate the correction of such errors, which we callcorpus correction.Using machine-learning methods, we applied corpus correction to a verb modality corpus for machine translation. We used the maximum-entropy and decision-list methods as machine-learning methods. We compared several kinds of methods for corpus correction in our experiments, and determined which is most effective by using a statistical test. We obtained several noteworthy findings: (1) Precision was almost the same for both detection and correction, so it is more convenient to do both correction and detection, rather than detection only. (2) In general, the maximum-entropy method worked better than the decision-list method; but the two methods had almost the same precision for the top 50 pieces of extracted data when closed data was used. (3) In terms of precision, the use of closed data was better than the use of open data; however, in terms of the total number of extracted errors, the use of open data was better than the use of closed data. Based on our analysis of these results, we developed a good method for corpus correction. We confirmed the effectiveness of our method by carrying out experiments on machine translation. As corpus-based machine translation continues to be developed, the corpus correction we discuss in this article should prove to be increasingly significant.", "authors": [{"name": "masaki murata", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329490812"}, {"name": "masao utiyama", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100491189"}, {"name": "kiyotaka uchimoto", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100120213"}, {"name": "hitoshi isahara", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100636896"}, {"name": "qing ma", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100447189"}], "title": "Correction of errors in a verb modality corpus for machine translation with a machine-learning method", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "17\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "517\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of information and communications technology", "city": null, "Name": "masaki murata"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of information and communications technology", "city": null, "Name": "masao utiyama"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of information and communications technology", "city": null, "Name": "kiyotaka uchimoto"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of information and communications technology", "city": null, "Name": "hitoshi isahara"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "ryukoku university", "affiliation_string": "ryukoku university and national institute of information and communications technology", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "qing ma"}]}, "Pages: 38-52": {"references": ["Ainsworth, W.

The data analysis classifies the questions in the collected QA (question-answer) pairs into ten question types in accordance with question stems. The answers in the QA pairs are then paragraphed and clustered using latent semantic analysis and the K-means algorithm. For semantic representation of the aspects, a domain-specific ontology is constructed based on WordNet and HowNet. A probabilistic mixture model is then used to interpret the query and QA pairs based on independent aspects; hence the retrieval process can be viewed as the maximum likelihood estimation problem. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is employed to estimate the optimal mixing weights in the probabilistic mixture model. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach outperformed the FAQ-Finder system in medical FAQ retrieval.", "authors": [{"name": "chung-hsien wu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350591456"}, {"name": "jui-feng yeh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81387605995"}, {"name": "ming-jun chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329488030"}], "title": "Domain-specific FAQ retrieval using independent aspects", "citations": [{"Name": "A.

In general, a fine-grained answer taxonomy improves QA performance but it is difficult to build an accurate answer extraction module for the fine-grained taxonomy because Machine Learning methods require a huge training corpus and hand-crafted rules are hard to maintain. Therefore, we built a fine-grained system by using a coarse-grained named entity recognizer and a Japanese lexicon \u201cNihongo Goi-taikei.\u201d Our experiments show that named entity/numerical expression recognition and word sense-based answer extraction mainly contributed to the performance.

To utilize a Boolean query effectively, a mechanism to retrieve as many as possible relevant documents is therefore required. In accordance with this requirement, we propose a method for modifying a given Boolean query by using information from a relevant document set. The retrieval results, however, may deteriorate if some important query terms are removed by this reformulation. A further mechanism is thus required in order to use other query terms that are useful for finding more relevant documents, but are not strictly required in relevant documents. To meet this requirement, we propose a new method that combines the probabilistic IR and the Boolean IR models. We also introduce a new IR system---called appropriate Boolean query reformulation for information retrieval (ABRIR)---based on these two methods and the Okapi system. ABRIR uses both a word index and a phrase index formed from combinations of two adjacent noun words.

An impediment to the use of chronological ordering, which is widely used by conventional summarization system, is that it arranges sentences without considering the presupposed information of each sentence. We propose a method to improve chronological ordering by resolving precedent information of arranging sentences. Combining the refinement algorithm with topical segmentation and chronological ordering, we address our experiments and metrics to test the effectiveness of MDS tasks.

In this paper, we empirically examine what kinds of abilities are needed for question answering systems in such situations, and propose a challenge for evaluating those abilities objectively and quantitatively. We also show that existing technologies have the potential to address this challenge. From the empirical study, we found that questions that have values and names as answers account for a majority in realistic information-gathering situations and that those sequences of questions contain a wide range of reference expressions and are sometimes complicated by the inclusion of subdialogues and focus shifts. The challenge proposed is not only novel as an evaluation of the handling of information access dialogues, but also includes several valuable ideas such as categorization and characterization of information access dialogues, and introduces three measures to evaluate various aspects in addressing list-type questions and reference test sets for evaluating context-processing ability in isolation.", "authors": [{"name": "tsuneaki kato", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100331039"}, {"name": "junichi fukumoto", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309484174"}, {"name": "fumito masui", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100635851"}, {"name": "noriko kando", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100253509"}], "title": "Are open-domain question answering technologies useful for information access dialogues?---an empirical study and a proposal of a novel challenge", "citations": [{"Name": "Tatsunori Mori ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shinpei Kawaguchi ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Madoka Ishioroshi", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Answering contextual questions based on the cohesion with knowledge", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "12\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "401\n", "Citation Count": "4\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of tokyo tokyo japan", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "tsuneaki kato"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "ritsumeikan university", "affiliation_string": "ritsumeikan university shiga-ken japan", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "junichi fukumoto"}, {"country": "spain", "university": "ie university", "affiliation_string": "mie university mie-ken japan", "city": "segovia", "Name": "fumito masui"}, {"country": "Japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of informatics tokyo japan", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "noriko kando"}]}}, "date": {"month": "September", "year": "2005"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Pages: 111-135": {"references": ["Amati, G., Carpineto, C., and Romano, G. 2004.

To enhance the reliability of PRF, Flexible PRF has been proposed, which adjusts the number of pseudo-relevant documents and/or the number of expansion terms for each topic. This paper explores a new, inexpensive Flexible PRF method, called Selective Sampling, which is unique in that it can skip documents in the initial ranked output to look for more \u201cnovel\u201d pseudo-relevant documents. While Selective Sampling is only comparable to Traditional PRF in terms of average performance and reliability, per-topic analyses show that Selective Sampling outperforms Traditional PRF almost as often as Traditional PRF outperforms Selective Sampling. Thus, treating the topPdocuments as relevant is often not the best strategy. However, predictingwhenSelective Sampling outperforms Traditional PRF appears to be as difficult as predicting when a PRF method fails. For example, our per-topic analyses show that even the proportion of truly relevant documents in the pseudo-relevant set is not necessarily a good performance predictor.", "authors": [{"name": "tetsuya sakai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100193167"}, {"name": "toshihiko manabe", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309492693"}, {"name": "makoto koyama", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329489950"}], "title": "Flexible pseudo-relevance feedback via selective sampling", "citations": [{"Name": "Debasis Ganguly ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Johannes Leveling ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gareth J.

Our goal was to evaluate the performance and robustness of our recently developed commercial-grade CLIR systems for English and Asian languages. The main contribution of this article is the investigation of different strategies, their interactions in both monolingual and bilingual retrieval tasks, and their respective contributions to operational retrieval systems in the context of NTCIR-4. We report results of Japanese and English monolingual retrieval and results of Japanese-to-English bilingual retrieval. In monolingual retrieval analysis, we examine two special properties of the NTCIR experimental design (two levels of relevance and identical queries in multiple languages) and explore how they interact with strategies of our retrieval system, including pseudo-relevance feedback, multi-word term down-weighting, and term weight merging strategies. Our analysis shows that the choice of language (English or Japanese) does not have a significant impact on retrieval performance. Query expansion is slightly more effective withrelaxedjudgments than withrigidjudgments. For better retrieval performance, weights of multi-word terms should be lowered. In the bilingual retrieval analysis, we aim to identify robust strategies that are effective when used alone and when used in combination with other strategies. We examine cross-lingual specific strategies such as translation disambiguation and translation structuring, as well as general strategies such as pseudo-relevance feedback and multi-word term down-weighting. For shorter title topics, pseudo-relevance feedback is a major performance enhancer, but translation structuring affects retrieval performance negatively when used alone or in combination with other strategies. All experimented strategies improve retrieval performance for the longer description topics, with pseudo-relevance feedback and translation structuring as the major contributors.", "authors": [{"name": "yan qu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100337837"}, {"name": "david a hull", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81408591660"}, {"name": "gregory grefenstette", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81342496111"}, {"name": "david a evans", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=88058606957"}, {"name": "motoko ishikawa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309482846"}, {"name": "setsuko nara", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309505947"}, {"name": "toshiya ueda", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309504653"}, {"name": "daisuke noda", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309512235"}, {"name": "kousaku arita", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309502736"}, {"name": "yuki funakoshi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309498380"}, {"name": "hiroshi matsuda", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81539748456"}], "title": "Towards effective strategies for monolingual and bilingual information retrieval: Lessons learned from NTCIR-4", "citations": [{"Name": "Hua Cheng ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yan Qu ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jesse Montgomery ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "David A.

In preparing a patent application, it is essential to search for related patents that may invalidate the invention. However, it is time-consuming to identify them among the millions of patents. This article proposes a patent-retrieval method that considers a claim structure for a more accurate search for invalidity. This method uses a claim text as input; it consists of two retrieval stages. In stage 1, general text analysis and retrieval methods are applied to improve recall. In stage 2, the top N documents retrieved in stage 1 are rearranged to improve precision by applying text analysis and retrieval methods using the claim structure. Our two-stage retrieval introduces five precision-oriented analysis and retrieval methods: query-term extraction from a portion of a claim text that describes the characteristics of a claim; query term-weighting without term frequency; query term-weighting with \u201cmeasurement terms\u201d; text retrieval using only claims as a target; and calculating the relevant score by \u201cpartially\u201d adding scores in stage 2 to those in stage 1. Evaluation results using test sets of the NTCIR4 Patent Retrieval Task show that our methods are effective, though the degree of the effectiveness varies depending on the test sets.", "authors": [{"name": "hisao mase", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309488198"}, {"name": "tadataka matsubayashi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309506671"}, {"name": "yuichi ogawa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309486372"}, {"name": "makoto iwayama", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100131995"}, {"name": "tadaaki oshio", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309481449"}], "title": "Proposal of two-stage patent retrieval method considering the claim structure", "citations": [{"Name": "Antti J\u00e4rvelin ", "Country": "greece", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Anni J\u00e4rvelin ", "Country": "greece", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Preben Hansen", "Country": "greece", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "UTA and SICS at CLEF-IP'09", "Country": "greece", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiaoibng Xue ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "W.

At NTCIR-4, we explored methods for translation and disambiguation for OOV terms when using a Chinese query on an English collection. We have developed a new segmentation-free technique for automatic translation of Chinese OOV terms using the web. We have also investigated the effects of distance factor and window size when using a hidden Markov model to provide disambiguation.

Simple stemming is helpful in improving bigram indexing for Korean retrieval. For word indexing, keeping nouns only is preferable. Web-based translation reduces untranslated terms left over after MT and substantially improves CLIR results. Translation concatenation is found to consistently improve CLIR effectiveness, while combining a retrieval list from bigram and word indexing is also helpful. A method to disambiguate multiple MT outputs using a log likelihood ratio threshold was tested. Depending on the nature of the title or description queries, bigram only or a retrieval combination, or relaxed or rigid evaluations, direct bilingual CLIR returned an average precision of 71--79&percnt; (English-Korean) and 76--84&percnt; (Chinese-English) of the corresponding Korean-Korean and English-English monolingual results. Using English as a pivot in Chinese-Korean CLIR provides about 55--65&percnt; the effectiveness that Korean alone does. Entity/terminology translation at the pivot language stage accounts for a large portion of this deficiency.

An important operation in LM is smoothing of the document language model. However, the current smoothing techniques merely redistribute a portion of term probability according to their frequency of occurrences only in the whole document collection. No relationships between terms are considered and no inference is involved. In this article, we propose several inferential language models capable of inference using term relationships. The inference operation is carried out through a semantic smoothing either on the document model or query model, resulting in document or query expansion. The proposed models implement some of the logical inference capabilities proposed in the previous studies on logical models, but with necessary simplifications in order to make them tractable. They are a good compromise between inference power and efficiency. The models have been tested on several TREC collections, both in English and Chinese. It is shown that the integration of term relationships into the language modeling framework can consistently improve the retrieval effectiveness compared with the traditional language models. This study shows that language modeling is a suitable framework to implement basic inference operations in IR effectively.", "authors": [{"name": "jian-yun nie", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100564379"}, {"name": "guihong cao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323488540"}, {"name": "jing bai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81544050856"}], "title": "Inferential language models for information retrieval", "citations": [{"Name": "Raymond Y.

Therefore, many researchers have explored the utilization of temporal information in topic detection and tracking (TDT). They use either a story's publication time or temporal expressions in text to derive temporal relatedness between two stories or a story and a topic. However, past research neglects the fact that people tend to express a time with different granularities as time lapses. Based on a careful investigation of temporal information in news streams, we propose a new strategy with time granularity reasoning for utilizing temporal information in topic tracking. A set of topic times, which as a whole represent the temporal attribute of a topic, are distinguished from others in the given on-topic stories. The temporal relatedness between a story and a topic is then determined by the highest coreference level between each time in the story and each topic time where the coreference level between a test time and a topic time is inferred from the two times themselves, their granularities, and the time distance between the topic time and the publication time of the story where the test time appears. Furthermore, the similarity value between an incoming story and a topic, that is the likelihood that a story is on-topic, can be adjusted only when the new story is both temporally and semantically related to the target topic. Experiments on two different TDT corpora show that our proposed method could make good use of temporal information in news stories, and it consistently outperforms the baseline centroid algorithm and other algorithms which consider temporal relatedness.", "authors": [{"name": "baoli li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100476566"}, {"name": "wenjie li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100480838"}, {"name": "qin lu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100052294"}], "title": "Topic tracking with time granularity reasoning", "citations": [{"Name": "Xujian Zhao ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Peiquan Jin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lihua Yue", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Discovering topic time from web news", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "36\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "589\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "japan", "university": "polytechnic university", "affiliation_string": "the hong kong polytechnic university kowloon hong kong", "city": "sagamihara", "Name": "baoli li"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "polytechnic university", "affiliation_string": "the hong kong polytechnic university kowloon hong kong", "city": "sagamihara", "Name": "wenjie li"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "polytechnic university", "affiliation_string": "the hong kong polytechnic university kowloon hong kong", "city": "sagamihara", "Name": "qin lu"}]}, "Pages: 360-387": {"references": ["Adriani, M. 2000a.

This problem is even more challenging when only a bilingual dictionary is available, which is the focus of our work described here. In this paper, we will present a statistical framework for dictionary-based CLIR that estimates the translation probabilities of query words based on the monolingual word co-occurrence statistics. In addition, we will present two realizations of the proposed framework, i.e., the \u201cmaximum coherence model\u201d and the \u201cspectral query-translation model,\u201d that exploit different metrics for the coherence measurement between a translation of a query word and the theme of the entire query. Compared to previous work on dictionary-based CLIR, the proposed framework is advantageous in three aspects: (1) Translation probabilities are calculated explicitly to capture the uncertainty in translating queries; (2) translations of all query words are estimated simultaneously rather than independently; and (3) the formulated problem can be solved efficiently with a unique optimal solution. Empirical studies with Chinese--English cross-language information retrieval using TREC datasets have shown that the proposed models achieve a relative 10&percnt;--50&percnt; improvement, compared to other approaches that also exploit word co-occurrence statistics for query translation disambiguation.", "authors": [{"name": "yi liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81410594068"}, {"name": "rong jin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100054575"}, {"name": "joyce y chai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100205070"}], "title": "A statistical framework for query translation disambiguation", "citations": [{"Name": "G.

This article presents three statistical query translation models that focus on the resolution of query translation ambiguities. All the models assume that the selection of the translation of a query term depends on the translations of other terms in the query. They differ in the way linguistic structures are detected and exploited. The co-occurrence model treats a query as a bag of words and uses all the other terms in the query as the context for translation disambiguation. The other two models exploit linguistic dependencies among terms. The noun phrase (NP) translation model detects NPs in a query, and translates each NP as a unit by assuming that the translation of a term only depends on other terms within the same NP. Similarly, the dependency translation model detects and translates dependency triples, such as verb-object, as units. The evaluations show that linguistic structures always lead to more precise translations. The experiments of CLIR on TREC Chinese collections show that all three models have a positive impact on query translation and lead to significant improvements of CLIR performance over the simple dictionary-based translation method. The best results are obtained by combining the three models.", "authors": [{"name": "jianfeng gao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81363593892"}, {"name": "jian-yun nie", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100564379"}, {"name": "ming zhou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329493277"}], "title": "Statistical query translation models for cross-language information retrieval", "citations": [{"Name": "Jerome R.

Their key advantage is the ability to capture various nonindependent and overlapping features of inputs. However, several unexpected pitfalls have a negative influence on the model's performance; these mainly come from a high imbalance among classes, irregular phenomena, and potential ambiguity in the training data. This article presents a data-driven approach that can deal with such difficult data instances by discovering and emphasizing important conjunctions or associations of statistics hidden in the training data.

This article discusses the extraction of such semantically related entities (represented by domain terms) from biomedical literature. The method combines various text-based aspects, such as lexical, syntactic, and contextual similarities between terms. Lexical similarities are based on the level of sharing of word constituents. Syntactic similarities rely on expressions (such as term enumerations and conjunctions) in which a sequence of terms appears as a single syntactic unit. Finally, contextual similarities are based on automatic discovery of relevant contexts shared among terms. The approach is evaluated using the Genia resources, and the results of experiments are presented. Lexical and syntactic links have shown high precision and low recall, while contextual similarities have resulted in significantly higher recall with moderate precision.

We show that such information gives additional insights into the nature of the structures and/or biological functions of these objects, leading to valuable knowledge for subcategorization of protein families by the properties that the involved proteins do not have in common. Based on the observation that the expressions of negation employ mostly predictable syntactic structures that can be characterized by subclausal coordination and by clause-level parallelism, we present a system that extracts such contrastive information by identifying those syntactic structures with natural language processing techniques and with additional linguistic resources for semantics. The implemented system shows the performance of 85.7&percnt; precision and 61.5&percnt; recall, including 7.7&percnt; partial recall, or an F score of 76.6.

But manually constructing and tuning the rules are time-consuming processes and make the systems less portable. So supervised machine-learning methods were developed to generate the extraction rules automatically, but accepting the trade-off between precision and recall (high recall with low precision, and vice versa) is a barrier to improving performance. To make matters worse, a text in the biological domain is more complex because it often contains more than two biological events in a sentence, and one event in a noun chunk can be an entity for the other event. As a result, there are as yet no systems that give a good performance in extracting events in biological domains by using supervised machine learning.To overcome the limitations of previous systems and the complexity of biological texts, we present the following new ideas. First, we adopted a supervised machine-learning method to reduce the human effort in making extraction rules in order to obtain a highly domain-portable system. Second, we overcame the classical trade-off between precision and recall by using an event component verification method. Thus, machine learning occurs in two phases in our architecture. In the first phase, the system focuses on improving recall in extracting events between biological entities during a supervised machine-learning period. After extracting the biological events with automatically learned rules, in the second phase the system removes incorrect biological events by verifying the extracted event components with a maximum entropy (ME) classification method. In other words, the system targets for high recall in the first phase and tries to achieve high precision with a classifier in the second phase. Finally, we improved a supervised machine-learning algorithm so that it could learn a rule in a noun chunk and a rule extending throughout a sentence at two different levels, separately, for nested biological events.", "authors": [{"name": "eunju kim", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81313481545"}, {"name": "yu song", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329492150"}, {"name": "cheongjae lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81423593911"}, {"name": "kyoungduk kim", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452618304"}, {"name": "gary geunbae lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81363592225"}, {"name": "byoung-kee yi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81547076256"}, {"name": "jeongwon cha", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100205697"}], "title": "Two-phase learning for biological event extraction and verification", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "9\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "759\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "pohang university of science and technology pohang korea", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "eunju kim"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "pohang university of science and technology pohang korea", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "yu song"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "pohang university of science and technology pohang korea", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "cheongjae lee"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "pohang university of science and technology pohang korea", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "kyoungduk kim"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "pohang university of science and technology pohang korea", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "gary geunbae lee"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "pohang university of science and technology pohang korea", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "byoung-kee yi"}]}, "Pages: 4-21": {"references": ["Adam L.

In this study, in order to improve the performance of term recognition, we try to incorporate lexical knowledge into pre- and postprocessing of the term-recognition phase. In the preprocessing step, we use domain-salient words as lexical knowledge obtained by corpus comparison. In the postprocessing step, we utilize \u03c72-based collocations gained from Medline corpus.

The first method uses dependency relationships between words in a sentence. The second method uses proximity relationships, particularly information about the ordered co-occurrence of words in a sentence, to approximate the dependency relationships between them. AStructured Indexhas been constructed for these two methods, which represents the dependency relationships between words in a sentence as a set of binary trees. TheStructured Indexis created by morphological analysis and dependency analysis based on simple template matching and compound noun analysis derived from word statistics. Through retrieval experiments using the Japanese test collection for information retrieval systems (NTCIR-1, the NACSIS Test Collection for IR systems), it is shown that these two methods offer superior retrieval effectiveness compared with the TF--IDF method, and are effective with different databases and diverse search topics sets. There is little difference in retrieval effectiveness between these two methods.", "authors": [{"name": "atsushi matsumura", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100392709"}, {"name": "atsuhiro takasu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100489313"}, {"name": "jun adachi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100138247"}], "title": "Effect of relationships between words on Japanese information retrieval", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "12\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "390\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of tsukuba ibaraki japan", "city": "tsukuba", "Name": "atsushi matsumura"}, {"country": "Japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of informatics chiyoda-ku tokyo japan", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "atsuhiro takasu"}, {"country": "Japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of informatics chiyoda-ku tokyo japan", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "jun adachi"}]}, "Pages: 228-244": {"references": ["Adam L.

In particular, we attempt to interpret the results in terms of the character error rate (CER) by correlating them with the characteristics of the adaptation domain, measured by using the information-theoretic notion of cross entropy. We show that such a metric correlates well with the CER performance of the adaptation methods, and also show that the discriminative methods are not only superior to a MAP-based method in achieving larger CER reduction, but also in having fewer side effects and being more robust against the similarity between background and adaptation domains.", "authors": [{"name": "jianfeng gao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81363593892"}, {"name": "hisami suzuki", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329492434"}, {"name": "wei yuan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100116060"}], "title": "An empirical study on language model adaptation", "citations": [{"Name": "Mike Tian-Jian Jiang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tsung-Hsien Lee ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wen-Lian Hsu", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Qiang Wu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Christopher J.

There has been growing interest in the use of machine transliteration to assist machine translation and information retrieval. Three types of machine transliteration models---grapheme-based, phoneme-based, and hybrid---have been proposed. Surprisingly, there have been few reports of efforts to utilize the correspondence between source graphemes and source phonemes, although this correspondence plays an important role in machine transliteration. Furthermore, little work has been reported on ways to dynamically handle source graphemes and phonemes. In this paper, we propose a transliteration model that dynamically uses both graphemes and phonemes, particularly the correspondence between them. With this model, we have achieved better performance---improvements of about 15 to 41&percnt; in English-to-Korean transliteration and about 16 to 44&percnt; in English-to-Japanese transliteration---than has been reported for other models.", "authors": [{"name": "jong-hoon oh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100060026"}, {"name": "key-sun choi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100479622"}, {"name": "hitoshi isahara", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100636896"}], "title": "A machine transliteration model based on correspondence between graphemes and phonemes", "citations": [{"Name": "Manoj K.

It was less effective at the Chinese ad hoc retrieval tasks than other retrieval models in the NTCIR-3 evaluation workshop, but comparable to those in the NTCIR-4 and NTCIR-5 workshops. We do not know whether the lower level performance was due to the VSM's inherent deficiencies or to a less effective normalization of document length. Hence we evaluated the VSM with various pivoted normalizations of document length using the NTCIR-3 collection for confirmation. We found that VSM's retrieval effectiveness with pivoted normalization was comparable to other competitive retrieval models (for example, 2-Poisson), and that VSM's retrieval speed with pivoted normalization was similar to competitive retrieval models (2-Poisson). We proposed a novel adaptive scheme that automatically estimates the (near) best parameters for pivoted document-length normalization based on query size; the new normalization is calledadaptive pivoted document-length normalization. This scheme achieved good retrieval effectiveness, sometimes for short (title) queries and sometimes for long queries, without manually adjusting parameter values. We found that unique, adaptive pivoted normalization can enhance fixed pivoted normalizations for different test collections (TREC-5 and TREC-6). We also evaluated the VSM with the adaptive pivoted normalization using the pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) and found that this type of VSM performs similarly to the competitive retrieval models (2-Poisson) with PRF. Hence, we conclude that the VSM with unique (adaptive) pivoted document-length normalization is effective for Chinese IR and that its retrieval effectiveness is comparable to that of other competitive retrieval models with or without PRF for the reference test collections used in this evaluation.", "authors": [{"name": "tze leung chung", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451595175"}, {"name": "robert wing pong luk", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81411591672"}, {"name": "kam fai wong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350588362"}, {"name": "kui lam kwok", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81328489030"}, {"name": "dik lun lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81385591271"}], "title": "Adapting pivoted document-length normalization for query size: Experiments in Chinese and English", "citations": [{"Name": "W.

First, emotion generation rules (EGRs) are manually deduced from psychology to represent the conditions for generating emotion. Based on the EGRs, the emotional state of each sentence can be represented as a sequence of semantic labels (SLs) and attributes (ATTs); SLs are defined as the domain-independent features, while ATTs are domain-dependent. The emotion association rules (EARs) represented by SLs and ATTs for each emotion are automatically derived from the sentences in an emotional text corpus using thea priorialgorithm. Finally, a separable mixture model (SMM) is adopted to estimate the similarity between an input sentence and the EARs of each emotional state. Since some features defined in this approach are domain-dependent, a dialog system focusing on the students' daily expressions is constructed, and only three emotional states,happy, unhappy, and neutral, are considered for performance evaluation. According to the results of the experiments, given the domain corpus, the proposed approach is promising, and easily ported into other domains.", "authors": [{"name": "chung-hsien wu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350591456"}, {"name": "ze-jing chuang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100636970"}, {"name": "yu-chung lin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452604072"}], "title": "Emotion recognition from text using semantic labels and separable mixture models", "citations": [{"Name": "Cheng-Yu Lu ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "William W.

Although many studies have focused on identifying NEs within monolingual documents, aligning NEs in bilingual documents has not been investigated extensively due to the complexity of the task. In this article we introduce a new approach to aligning bilingual NEs in parallel corpora by incorporating statistical models with multiple knowledge sources. In our approach, we model the process of translating an English NE phrase into a Chinese equivalent using lexical translation/transliteration probabilities for word translation and alignment probabilities for word reordering. The method involves automatically learning phrase alignment and acquiring word translations from a bilingual phrase dictionary and parallel corpora, and automatically discovering transliteration transformations from a training set of name-transliteration pairs. The method also involves language-specific knowledge functions, including handling abbreviations, recognizing Chinese personal names, and expanding acronyms. At runtime, the proposed models are applied to each source NE in a pair of bilingual sentences to generate and evaluate the target NE candidates; the source and target NEs are then aligned based on the computed probabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach, which integrates statistical models with extra knowledge sources, is highly feasible and offers significant improvement in performance compared to our previous work, as well as the traditional approach of IBM Model 4.", "authors": [{"name": "chun-jen lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310493399"}, {"name": "jason s chang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452601172"}, {"name": "jyh-shing r jang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453633846"}], "title": "Alignment of bilingual named entities in parallel corpora using statistical models and multiple knowledge sources", "citations": [{"Name": "Fan Yang ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jun Zhao ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kang Liu", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "A Chinese-English organization name translation system using heuristic web mining and asymmetric alignment", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yuejie Zhang ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yang Wang ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lei Cen ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yanxia Su ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Cheng Jin ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiangyang Xue ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jianping Fan", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fusion of multiple features and ranking SVM for web-based English-Chinese OOV term translation", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "11\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "736\n", "Citation Count": "10\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national tsing hua university hsinchu taiwan", "city": null, "Name": "chun-jen lee"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national tsing hua university hsinchu taiwan", "city": null, "Name": "jason s chang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national tsing hua university hsinchu taiwan", "city": null, "Name": "jyh-shing r jang"}]}, "Pages: 89-120": {"references": ["Agirre, E., Ansa, O., Hovy, E., and Martinez, D. 2000.

Since the construction of an ontology from scratch is a very expensive and time-consuming undertaking, it is attractive to consider ways of automatically aligning monolingual ontologies, which already exist for many of the world's major languages. Previous research exploited similarity in the structure of the ontologies to align, or manually created bilingual resources. These approaches cannot be used to align ontologies with vastly different structures and can only be applied to much studied language pairs for which expensive resources are already available. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to align the ontologies at the node level: Given a concept represented by a particular word sense in one ontology, our task is to find the best corresponding word sense in the second language ontology. To this end, we present a language-independent, corpus-based method that borrows from techniques used in information retrieval and machine translation. We show its efficiency by applying it to two very different ontologies in very different languages: the Mandarin Chinese HowNet and the American English WordNet. Moreover, we propose a methodology to measure bilingual corpora comparability and show that our method is robust enough to use noisy nonparallel bilingual corpora efficiently, when clean parallel corpora are not available.", "authors": [{"name": "marine carpuat", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81318493092"}, {"name": "pascale fung", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100207745"}, {"name": "grace ngai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100430876"}], "title": "Aligning word senses using bilingual corpora", "citations": [{"Name": "Hyungsuk Ji ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bertrand Gaiffe ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hyunseung Choo", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Selecting target word using contexonym comparison method", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "21\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "612\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "hong kong university of science and technology kowloon hong kong", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "marine carpuat"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "hong kong university of science and technology kowloon hong kong", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "pascale fung"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "polytechnic university", "affiliation_string": "hong kong polytechnic university kowloon hong kong", "city": "sagamihara", "Name": "grace ngai"}]}}, "date": {"month": "June", "year": "2006"}}}, "Volume2": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Pages: 324-337": {"references": ["Richard A.

One method is a simple mapping algorithm that can find items referred with/without pointing gestures on a screen. The other is the centering algorithm with a dual cache model, to which Walker's centering algorithm is extended for a multimodal dialogue system. The extended algorithm is appropriate for resolving various anaphoric references in a multimodal dialogue.

Particular attention is given to processing Korean texts that may contain users' grammatical and practical errors. In order to treat these errors efficiently, the system includes methods based on asymmetric relations from which partial parsing and the potential governing relationship are derived, implying the starting point for checking, the direction for parsing, and the limits of the scope for parsing.To organize partial parsing efficiently, the system requires an appropriate knowledge base. As its essential prerequisites, this study (a) considers the factors from which the various error types encountered while parsing various Korean texts arise; (b) extracts general patterns from the linguistic or extra-linguistic factors obtained in this manner; and (c) demonstrates how the system, based on a linguistic analysis, procures an adequate knowledge base for partial parsing to satisfy end-users.

Two popular approaches are to extract features holistically from the character image or to decompose characters structurally into component parts---usually strokes. Here we take a novel approach, that of decomposing into radicals on the basis of image information (i.e., without first decomposing into strokes). During training, 60 examples of each radical were represented by \"landmark\" points, labeled semiautomatically, with radicals in different characteristic positions treated as distinctly different radicals. Kernel principal-component analysis then captured the main (nonlinear) variations around the mean radical. During the recognition, the dynamic tunneling algorithm was used to search for optimal shape parameters in terms of chamfer distance minimization. Considering character composition as a Markov process in which up to four radicals are combined in some assumed sequential order, we can recognize complete, hierarchically-composed characters by using the Viterbi algorithm. This gave a character recognition rate of 93.5% characters correct (writer-independent) on a test set of 430,800 characters from 2,154 character classes composed of 200 radical categories, which is comparable to the best reported results in the literature. Although the initial semiautomatic landmark labeling is time consuming, the decomposition approach is theoretically well-motivated and allows the different sources of variability in Chinese handwriting to be handled separately and by the most appropriate means--either learned from example data or incorporated as prior knowledge. Hence, high generalizability is obtained from small amounts of training data, and only simple prior knowledge needs to be incorporated, thus promising robust recognition performance. As such, there is very considerable potential for further development and improvement in the direction of larger character sets and less constrained writing conditions.", "authors": [{"name": "daming shi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81450592488"}, {"name": "robert i damper", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452615683"}, {"name": "steve r gunn", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81408594543"}], "title": "Offline handwritten Chinese character recognition by radical decomposition", "citations": [{"Name": "D. \u00c1lvarez ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "R.

Information sources that are in different languages can then be retrieved automatically with CL-SDR, and the number of searchable information sources will increase significantly. The HMM-based retrieval model is a probabilistic formulation for the retrieval problem. Extensions to this retrieval model can be made by taking advantage of its probabilistic nature. Specifically, we have incorporated the translation component to make it possible to perform cross-language information retrieval (CLIR). In addition, this HMM-based CLIR retrieval model is also extended for retrieval at subword scales.In this work the extended HMM-based retrieval model has been applied to an English-Mandarin CL-SDR task, which is to search the Mandarin spoken document collection with English queries at word and subword scales. Retrieval results obtained from these indexing scales are then fused for multi-scale CL-SDR. Experimental results demonstrate that improvement in CL-SDR retrieval performance can be achieved by fusion of word and subword scales.", "authors": [{"name": "wai-kit lo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100147075"}, {"name": "helen meng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100222801"}, {"name": "p c ching", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100002131"}], "title": "Cross-language spoken document retrieval using HMM-based retrieval model with multi-scale fusion", "citations": [{"Name": "Martha Larson ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gareth J.

Identified words are then segmented into individual characters in the next step, where the composite characters are identified and further segmented based on the structural properties of the script and statistical information. Segmented characters are recognized using generalized Hausdorff image comparison (GHIC) and postprocessing is applied to improve the performance. The OCR system, which was designed and implemented in one month, was applied to a complete Hindi--English bilingual dictionary and a set of ideal images extracted from Hindi documents in PDF format.

This task is difficult because the user must make decisions about relevance based on (often poor) translations of retrieved documents. To facilitate the decision-making process we need translations that can be assessed rapidly and accurately; our approach is to provide an English headline for the non-English document. We describe two approaches to headline generation and their application to the recent DARPA TIDES-2003 Surprise Language Exercise for Hindi. For comparison, we also implemented an alternative method for surrogate generation: a system that produces topic lists for (Hindi) articles. We present the results of a series of experiments comparing each of these approaches. We demonstrate in both automatic and human evaluations that our linguistically motivated approach outperforms two other surrogate-generation methods: a statistical system and a topic discovery system.", "authors": [{"name": "bonnie dorr", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100443596"}, {"name": "david zajic", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100489999"}, {"name": "richard schwartz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81406598305"}], "title": "Cross-language headline generation for Hindi", "citations": [{"Name": "Prasad Pingali ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kula Kekeba Tune ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Vasudeva Varma", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hindi", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "telugu", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "oromo", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "english CLIR evaluation", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daqing He ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Douglas W.

Rapid development of interactive systems that use queries expressed in one language to search documents written in another poses five key challenges: (1) interaction design, (2) query formulation, (3) cross-language search, (4) construction of translated summaries, and (5) machine translation. This article describes the design of MIRACLE, an easily extensible system based on English queries that has previously been used to search French, German, and Spanish documents, and explains how the capabilities of MIRACLE were rapidly extended to accommodate Cebuano and Hindi. Evaluation results for the cross-language search component are presented for both languages, along with results from a brief full-system interactive experiment with Hindi. The article concludes with some observations on directions for further research on interactive cross-language information retrieval.", "authors": [{"name": "daqing he", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81316488890"}, {"name": "douglas w oard", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100424535"}, {"name": "jianqiang wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451601329"}, {"name": "jun luo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100416860"}, {"name": "dina demner-fushman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323489609"}, {"name": "kareem darwish", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100547710"}, {"name": "philip resnik", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329491476"}, {"name": "sanjeev khudanpur", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100418948"}, {"name": "michael nossal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100257716"}, {"name": "michael subotin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100522908"}, {"name": "anton leuski", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100344761"}], "title": "Making MIRACLEs: Interactive translingual search for Cebuano and Hindi", "citations": [{"Name": "Dan Wu ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daqing He", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daqing He ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jianqiang Wang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jun Luo ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Douglas W.

Experiments in \"porting\" technologies to handle new natural languages have revealed a great potential for multilingual computing, but also a frustrating lack of linguistic resources for most languages. Recent efforts to address the lack of available resources have focused either on intensive resource development for a small number of languages or development of technologies for rapid porting. The Linguistic Data Consortium recently participated in an experiment falling primarily under the first approach,the surprise language exercise. This article describes linguistic resource creation within this context, including the overall methodology for surveying and collecting language resources, as well as details of the resources developed during the exercise. The article concludes with discussion of a new approach to solving the problem of limited linguistic resources, one that has recently proven effective in identifying core linguistic resources for less common studied languages.", "authors": [{"name": "stephanie strassel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100645146"}, {"name": "mike maxwell", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100351950"}, {"name": "christopher cieri", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310493323"}], "title": "Linguistic resource creation for research and technology development: A recent experiment", "citations": [{"Name": "Prasad Pingali ", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi ", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Vasudeva Varma", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fredric C.

The method makes use of local statistical information (i.e., data within a document) to identify and discard repeated string patterns, which, at an earlier stage, were substrings of legitimate words. Global statistical information (which exists throughout the entire corpus) and contextual constraints are then used for further filtering. The method can be used to alleviate the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem, which is commonly found in dictionary-based natural language information-processing applications, e.g., word segmentation. It can handle text corpora dynamically and, further, it does not impose any strict requirements on the size and quality of the training corpora. Based on our method, we constructed Chinese dictionaries from different Chinese corpora. We then applied the words in the constructed dictionaries to indexing in information retrieval (IR). Retrieval performance using such indexes was compared to the same, but based on indexes produced by static dictionaries. Three Chinese corpora using various character-encoding schemes and language styles were used in the experiments. The results show that retrieval using indexes based on the constructed dictionary is effective. This implies that fully automatic Chinese dictionary construction based on dynamic data sources, e.g., from the Internet, for the purposes of IR is feasible. Drawing on the experiment, we were able to make some interesting observations: (1) using only a portion of a dictionary is enough to produce good retrieval performance, e.g., a dictionary consisting of only the 500 highest-frequency strings extracted from the NTCIR 2 Chinese corpus produced as good a retrieval result as using a more complete dictionary with over 100K entries; and (2) complete word segmentation is not a strict requirement for achieving practical information retrieval.", "authors": [{"name": "honglan jin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350601908"}, {"name": "kam-fai wong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350588362"}], "title": "A Chinese dictionary construction algorithm for information retrieval", "citations": [{"Name": "Louis Yu ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kin Fun Li ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Eric G.

However, with the increase in the number of candidates given by a character recognizer, contextual postprocessing using a word-based bigram is time-consuming. This article presents a novel contextual postprocessing method that integrates character-based bigram postprocessing with word-based bigram postprocessing in light of the complementary action between Chinese characters and Chinese words. On the basis of isolated character recognition, character-based bigram postprocessing using a forward-backward search is first executed on a big candidate set, which improves both the accuracy and efficiency of the candidate set (the cumulative accuracy of the top ten candidates is greatly boosted). Then, to further improve accuracy, word-based bigram postprocessing (WBP) is executed on a small candidate set. This method obtains high accuracy while paying attention to postprocessing speed at the same time. Experimental results for three Chinese scripts (about 66,000 characters in total) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method: character-based bigram postprocessing improves accuracy from 81.58% to 94.50%, and the cumulative accuracy of the top ten candidates rises from 94.33% to 98.25%. After WBP, 95.75% accuracy is achieved, which is equivalent to the accuracy of WBP executed on a big candidate set. However, our method is more than 100 times faster than that of WBP.", "authors": [{"name": "yuanxiang li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81423594527"}, {"name": "xiaoqing ding", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100136237"}, {"name": "chew lim tan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100256274"}], "title": "Combining character-based bigrams with word-based bigrams in contextual postprocessing for Chinese script recognition", "citations": [{"Name": "Michael Chau ", "Country": "hong kong", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiao Fang ", "Country": "hong kong", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Christopher C.

This research is based on the belief that tone information, if acquired accurately and utilized effectively, contributes to the automatic speech recognition of Chinese. In particular, we focus on the Cantonese dialect, which is spoken by tens of millions of people in Southern China and Hong Kong. Cantonese is well known for its complicated tone system, which makes automatic tone recognition very difficult. This article describes an effective approach to explicit tone recognition of Cantonese in continuously spoken utterances. Tone feature vectors are derived, on a short-time basis, to characterize the syllable-wide patterns of F0 (fundamental frequency) and energy movements. A moving-window normalization technique is proposed to reduce the tone-irrelevant fluctuation of F0 and energy features. Hidden Markov models are employed for context-dependent acoustic modeling of different tones. A tone recognition accuracy of 66.4% has been achieved in the speaker-independent case. The recognized tone patterns are then utilized to assist Cantonese large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) via a lattice expansion approach. Experimental results show that reliable tone information helps to improve the overall performance of LVCSR.", "authors": [{"name": "tan lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100385050"}, {"name": "wai lau", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81543441456"}, {"name": "y w wong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331507277"}, {"name": "p c ching", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100002131"}], "title": "Using tone information in Cantonese continuous speech recognition", "citations": [{"Name": "Audrey Mbogho ", "Country": "south africa", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michelle Katz", "Country": "south africa", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jiang-Chun Chen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jyh-Shing Roger Jang", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yao Qian ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Frank K.

For example, a large sized phonetic dictionary and complex morphophonemic rules are required for the dictionary-based method and the LTS (letter to sound) rule-based method itself cannot model the complete morphophonemic constraints.This paper describes a grapheme-to-phoneme conversion method for Korean using a dictionary-based and rule-based hybrid method with a phonetic pattern dictionary and CCV (consonant consonant vowel) LTS (letter to sound) rules. The phonetic pattern dictionary, standing for the dictionary-based method, contains entries in the form of a morpheme pattern and its phonetic pattern. The patterns represent candidate phonological changes in left and right boundaries of morphemes. Obviously, the CCV LTS rules stand for the rule-based method. The rules are in charge of grapheme-to-phoneme conversion within morphemes.The conversion method consists of mainly two steps including morpheme to phoneme conversion and morphophonemic connectivity check, and two preprocessing steps including phrase break prediction and morpheme normalization. Phrase break prediction presumes phrase breaks using the stochastic method on part-of-speech (POS) information. Morpheme normalization is to replace non-Korean symbols with their corresponding standard Korean graphemes. In the morpheme-phoneticizing module, each morpheme in the phrase is converted into phonetic patterns by looking it up in the phonetic pattern dictionary. Graphemes within a morpheme are grouped into CCV units and converted into phonemes by the CCV LTS rules. The morphophonemic connectivity table supports grammaticality checking of the two adjacent phonetic morphemes.In experiments with a non-Korean symbol free corpus of 4,973 sentences, we achieved a 99.98% grapheme-to-phoneme conversion performance rate and a 99.0% sentence conversion performance rate. With a broadcast news corpus of 621 sentences, 99.7% of the graphemes and 86.6% of the sentences are correctly converted. The full Korean TTS (Text-to-Speech) system is now being implemented using this conversion method.", "authors": [{"name": "byeongchang kim", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452598644"}, {"name": "gary geunbae lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81363592225"}, {"name": "jong-hyeok lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100429953"}], "title": "Morpheme-based grapheme to phoneme conversion using phonetic patterns and morphophonemic connectivity information", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "28\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "462\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Cameroon", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "uiduk university kangdong kyongju south korea", "city": "south", "Name": "byeongchang kim"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "pohang university of science and technology and uiduk university kangdong kyongju south korea", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "gary geunbae lee"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "pohang university of science and technology and uiduk university kangdong kyongju south korea", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "jong-hyeok lee"}]}, "Pages: 1-2": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/595576.595577", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "kam-fai wong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350599383"}, {"name": "junichi tsujii", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351591838"}], "title": "Prologue", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "13\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "181\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "kam-fai wong"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "junichi tsujii"}]}, "Pages: 34-64": {"references": ["Alfred V.

For meaningful term extraction, a phrase-like unit (PLU)-based likelihood ratio is proposed to estimate the likelihood that a word sequence is an unknown word. On the other hand, a discriminative measure is proposed for term selection and is combined with the PLU-based likelihood ratio to determine the text category. We conducted several experiments on a news corpus, called MSDN. The MSDN corpus is collected from an online news Website maintained by the Min-Sheng Daily News, Taiwan. The corpus contains 44,675 articles with over 35 million words. The experimental results show that the system using a simple classifier achieved 95.31% accuracy. When using a state-of-the-art classifier, kNN, the average accuracy is 96.40%, outperforming all the other systems evaluated on the same collection, including the traditional term-word by kNN (88.52%); sleeping-experts (82.22%); sparse phrase by four-word sleeping-experts (86.34%); and Boolean combinations of words by RIPPER (87.54%). A proposed purification process can effectively reduce the dimensionality of the feature space from 50,576 terms in the word-based approach to 19,865 terms in the unknown word-based approach. In addition, more than 80% of automatically extracted terms are meaningful.

Applying SLM techniques like trigram language models to Chinese is challenging because (1) there is no standard definition of words in Chinese; (2) word boundaries are not marked by spaces; and (3) there is a dearth of training data. Our unified approach automatically and consistently gathers a high-quality training data set from the Web, creates a high-quality lexicon, segments the training data using this lexicon, and compresses the language model, all by using the maximum likelihood principle, which is consistent with trigram model training. We show that each of the methods leads to improvements over standard SLM, and that the combined method yields the best pinyin conversion result reported.", "authors": [{"name": "jianfeng gao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81363593892"}, {"name": "joshua goodman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100005023"}, {"name": "mingjing li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81430626886"}, {"name": "kai-fu lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100390014"}], "title": "Toward a unified approach to statistical language modeling for Chinese", "citations": [{"Name": "Robert C.

ToBI is a multitier representation system based on linguistic knowledge that transcribes events in an utterance. The TTS (Text-To-Speech) system, which adopts ToBI as an intermediate representation, is known to exhibit higher flexibility, modularity, and domain/task portability compared to the direct prosody generation TTS systems. However, for practical-level performance, the cost of corpus preparation is very expensive because the ToBI labeled corpus is constructed manually by many prosody experts, and normally requires large amounts of data for statistical prosody modeling. Unlike previous ToBI-based systems, this article proposes a new method, which transcribes the K-ToBI labels in Korean speech completely automatically. We develop automatic corpus-based K-ToBI labeling tools and prediction methods based on several lexico-syntactic linguistic features for decision-tree induction. We demonstrate the performance of F0 generation from automatically predicted K-ToBI labels, and confirm that the performance is reasonably comparable to state-of-the-art direct prosody generation methods and previous ToBI-based methods.", "authors": [{"name": "jin-seok lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81544105956"}, {"name": "byeongchang kim", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452598644"}, {"name": "gary geunbae lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81363592225"}], "title": "Automatic corpus-based tone and break-index prediction using K-ToBI representation", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "8\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "587\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "jin-seok lee"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "byeongchang kimuiduk university kyongju south korea"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "gary geunbae lee"}]}, "Pages: 225-268": {"references": ["ALLAN, J., CALLAN, J., CROFT, B.W., BALLESTEROS, L., BROGLIO, J., XU, J., AND SHU, H. 1996.

Since, in this type of language, spaces do not delimit words, an important issue is which index terms should be extracted from documents. This issue also has wider implications for indexing other languages such as agglutinating languages (e.g., Finnish and Turkish), archaic ideographic languages like Egyptian hieroglyphs, and other types of information such as data stored in genomic databases. Although comparisons of indexing strategies for Chinese documents have been made, almost all of them are based on a single retrieval model. This article compares the performance of various combinations of indexing strategies (i.e., character, word, short-word, bigram, and Pircs indexing) and retrieval models (i.e., vector space, 2-Poisson, logistic regression, and Pircs models). We determine which model (and its parameters) achieves the (near) best retrieval effectiveness without relevance feedback, and compare it with the open evaluations (i.e., TREC and NTCIR) for both long and title queries. In addition, we describe a more extensive investigation of retrieval efficiency. In particular, the storage cost of word indexing is only slightly more than character indexing, and bigram indexing is about double the storage cost of other indexing strategies. The retrieval time typically varies linearly with the number of unique terms in the query, which is supported by correlation values above 90%. The Pircs retrieval system achieves robust and good retrieval performance, but it appears to be the slowest method, whereas vector space models were not very effective in retrieval, but were able to respond quickly. For robust, near-best retrieval effectiveness, without considering storage overhead, the 2-Poisson model using bigram indexing appears to be a good compromise between retrieval effectiveness and efficiency for both long and title queries.", "authors": [{"name": "robert w p luk", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81411591672"}, {"name": "k l kwok", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81328489030"}], "title": "A comparison of Chinese document indexing strategies and retrieval models", "citations": [{"Name": "Kin F.

For example, users' queries on how one event is related to another in time could not be handled effectively. For this reason, it is important to capture and deduce temporal knowledge associated with the relevant events. It is generally acknowledged that information extraction cannot be isolated from natural language processing. As Chinese has no tenses, conventional means for finding temporal references based on verb forms no longer apply. In this article we present an approach for formulating and discovering temporal relations in Chinese. A set of rules is devised to map the combinational effects of the temporal indicators (also known as temporal markers, gathered from various grammatical categories) in a sentence to its corresponding temporal relation. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, experiments were conducted using a set of news reports and the results look promising. Problem discussions are also provided. Through this work, we hope to open up new doors for future research in Chinese temporal information extraction and processing.", "authors": [{"name": "wenjie li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100480838"}, {"name": "kam-fai wong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350588362"}], "title": "A word-based approach for modeling and discovering temporal relations embedded in Chinese sentences", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "17\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "1165\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "japan", "university": "polytechnic university", "affiliation_string": "the hong kong polytechnic university", "city": "sagamihara", "Name": "wenjie li"}, {"country": "hong kong", "university": "university of hong kong", "affiliation_string": "the chinese university of hong kong", "city": "xianggangdao", "Name": "kam-fai wong"}]}, "Pages: 269-278": {"references": ["CAVNAR, W.

When a small Thai corpus is used for training, these taggers have tagging accuracies of, respectively, 94.4% and 95.5% (accounting only for the ambiguous words that relate to the parts of speech). In this study, in order to construct more accurate taggers, we developed new tagging methods using three different machine-learning approaches: the decision list, maximum entropy, and the support vector machine methods. We then performed tagging experiments using them. Our results show that the support vector machine method has the best precision (96.1%), and that it is capable of improving the accuracy of tagging in the Thai language. The improvement in accuracy was also confirmed by using a statistical test (a sign test). Finally, we examined theoretically all these methods in an effort to determine how the improvements were achieved. We found that the improvements were due to our use of word information, which is helpful for tagging, and a support vector machine that performed well.", "authors": [{"name": "masaki murata", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329490812"}, {"name": "qing ma", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100447189"}, {"name": "hitoshi isahara", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100636896"}], "title": "Comparison of three machine-learning methods for Thai part-of-speech tagging", "citations": [{"Name": "Atom Nuntiyagul ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nick Cercone ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kanlaya Naruedomkul", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Anthony McCloskey ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ronan McIvor ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Liam Maguire ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Paul Humphreys ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tina O'Donnell", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Robert M.

In usingLR(k)parsers for natural language processing, we are faced with the problem of rapid growth in parsing table sizes as the number of grammar rules increases. We propose to partition the grammar into multiple subgrammars, each having its own parsing table and parser. Grammar partitioning helps reduce the overall parsing table size when compared to using a single grammar. We used the GLR parser with an LR(1) parsing table in our framework because GLR parsers can handle ambiguity in natural language. A parser composition technique then combines the parsers' outputs to produce an overall parse that is the same as the output parse of single parser. Two different strategies were used for parser composition: (i) parser composition by cascading; and (ii) parser composition with predictive pruning.Our experiments were conducted with natural language queries from the ATIS (Air Travel Information Service) domain. We have manually translated the ATIS-3 corpora into Chinese, and consequently we could experiment with grammar partitioning on parallel linguistic corpora. For English, the unpartitioned ATIS grammar has 72,869 states in its parsing table, while the partitioned English grammar has 3,350 states in total. For Chinese, grammar partitioning reduced the overall parsing table size from 29,734 states to 3,894 states. Both results show thatgrammar partitioninggreatly economizes on the overall parsing table size. Language understanding performances were also examined. Parser composition imparts a robust parsing capability in our framework, and hence obtains a higher understanding performance when compared to using a single GLR parser.", "authors": [{"name": "helen meng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100222801"}, {"name": "po-chui luk", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100307139"}, {"name": "kui xu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442607104"}, {"name": "fuliang weng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100179802"}], "title": "GLR parsing with multiple grammars for natural language queries", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "22\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "913\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "hong kong", "university": "university of hong kong", "affiliation_string": "the chinese university of hong kong", "city": "xianggangdao", "Name": "helen meng"}, {"country": "hong kong", "university": "university of hong kong", "affiliation_string": "the chinese university of hong kong", "city": "xianggangdao", "Name": "po-chui luk"}, {"country": "hong kong", "university": "university of hong kong", "affiliation_string": "the chinese university of hong kong", "city": "xianggangdao", "Name": "kui xu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "robert bosch corporation", "city": null, "Name": "fuliang weng"}]}, "Pages: 103-122": {"references": ["ARTALE, A., MAGNINII, B., AND STRAPPARAVA, C. 1997.
