We assume bidders consider wealth in standard quasilinear form as valuation minus payments. Additionally, they are sensitive to risk in the distribution of wealth stemming from randomized mechanisms. First- and second-order stochastic dominance are well known to capture risk sensitivity, and we apply these concepts to capture truth-telling incentives for bidders.As our first main result, we provide a complete characterization of all social-choice functions over binary single-parameter domains that can be implemented by a mechanism that is truthful in first- and second-order stochastic dominance. We show that these are exactly the social-choice functions implementable by truthful-in-expectation mechanisms, and we provide a novel payment rule that guarantees stochastic dominance. As our second main result we extend the celebrated randomized metarounding approach for truthful-in-expectation mechanisms in packing domains. We design mechanisms that are truthful in first-order stochastic dominance by spending only a logarithmic factor in the approximation guarantee.", "authors": [{"name": "martin hoefer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350574405"}, {"name": "thomas kesselheim", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81438596535"}, {"name": "berthold vocking", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100492810"}], "title": "Truthfulness and Stochastic Dominance with Monetary Transfers", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "24\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "24\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "max-planck-institut fur informatik and saarland university saarbrucken germany", "city": "saarbrucken", "Name": "martin hoefer"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "max-planck-institut fur informatik and saarland university saarbrucken germany", "city": "saarbrucken", "Name": "thomas kesselheim"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "rwth aachen university", "city": "aachen", "Name": "berthold vocking"}]}, "Article No.: 8": {"references": ["Susanne Albers, On the Value of Coordination in Network Design, SIAM Journal on Computing, v.38 n.6, p.2273-2302, February 2009[doi>10.1137/070701376]\n", "Elliot Anshelevich , Anirban Dasgupta , Jon Kleinberg , \u00c9va Tardos , Tom Wexler , Tim Roughgarden, The Price of Stability for Network Design with Fair Cost Allocation, SIAM Journal on Computing, v.38 n.4, p.1602-1623, July 2008[doi>10.1137/070680096]\n", "E.

Nonanonymous cost functions model asymmetries between the players, which can arise from different bandwidth requirements, durations of use, services needed, and so on.These games can possess multiple Nash equilibria of wildly varying quality. The goal of this article is to identify well-motivated equilibrium refinements that admit good worst-case approximation bounds. Our primary results are tight bounds on the cost of strong Nash equilibria and potential function minimizers in network cost-sharing games with nonanonymous cost functions, parameterized by the setCof allowable submodular cost functions.These two worst-case bounds coincide for every setC, and equal thesummabilityparameter introduced in Roughgarden and Sundararajan [2009] to characterize efficiency loss in a family of cost-sharing mechanisms.

Selfish agents with private information are each associated with exactly one strategic mediator, and can interact with the mechanism exclusively through that mediator. Each mediator aims to optimize the combined utility ofhisagents, while the mechanism aims to optimize the combined utility ofallagents. We focus on the problem of facility location on a metric induced by a publicly known tree. With nonstrategic mediators, there is a dominant strategy mechanism that is optimal. We show that when both agents and mediators act strategically, there is no dominant strategy mechanism that achievesanyapproximation. We, thus, slightly relax the incentive constraints, and define the notion of atwo-sided incentive compatiblemechanism. We show that the 3-competitivedeterministicmechanism suggested by Procaccia and Tennenholtz [2013] and Dekel et al. [2010] for lines extends naturally to trees, and is still 3-competitive as well as two-sided incentive compatible. This is essentially the best possible (follows from Dekel et al. [2010] and Procaccia and Tennenholtz [2013]). We then show that by allowing randomization one can construct a 2-competitiverandomizedmechanism that is two-sided incentive compatible, and this is also essentially tight. This result also reduces a gap left in the work of Procaccia and Tennenholtz [2013] and Lu et al. [2009] for the problem of designing strategy-proof mechanisms for weighted agents with no mediators on a line.

Applications include auctioning time for using a shared device, auctioning TV commercial slots, and more. Different agents may have different valuations for the different possible intervals; the goal is to maximize the aggregate utility. Agents are self-interested and may misrepresent their true valuation functions if this benefits them. Thus, we seek auctions that aretruthful. Considering the case that each agent may obtain a single interval, the challenge is twofold, as we need to determine both where to slice the interval, and who gets what slice. We consider two settings: discrete and continuous. In the discrete setting, we are given asequenceofmindivisible elements (e1, \u2026,em), and the auction must allocate each agent aconsecutive subsequenceof the elements. In the continuous setting, we are given a continuous, infinitely divisible interval, and the auction must allocate each agent a subinterval. The agents\u2019 valuations are nonatomic measures on the interval. We show that, for both settings, the associated computational problem is NP-complete even under very restrictive assumptions. Hence, we provide approximation algorithms. For the discrete case, we provide a truthful auctioning mechanism that approximates the optimal welfare to within a logmfactor. The mechanism works for arbitrary monotone valuations. For the continuous setting, we provide a truthful auctioning mechanism that approximates the optimal welfare to within anO(logn) factor (wherenis the number of agents). Additionally, we provide a truthful 2-approximation mechanism for the case that all pieces must be of some fixed size.", "authors": [{"name": "yonatan aumann", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100592005"}, {"name": "yair dombb", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81460658301"}, {"name": "avinatan hassidim", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100303802"}], "title": "Auctioning Time: Truthful Auctions of Heterogeneous Divisible Goods", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "29\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "29\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Maldives", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "bar-ilan university ramat gan israel", "city": "gan", "Name": "yonatan aumann"}, {"country": "Maldives", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "bar-ilan university ramat gan israel", "city": "gan", "Name": "yair dombb"}, {"country": "Maldives", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "bar-ilan university ramat gan israel", "city": "gan", "Name": "avinatan hassidim"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Gagan Aggarwal , S.

The main drawback of standard mechanisms for this type of auctions, such as VCG and GSP, is thelimited expressivenessthat they offer to the bidders. The General Auction Mechanism (GAM) of Aggarwal et al. [2009] takes a first step toward addressing the problem of limited expressiveness by computing a bidder optimal, envy-free outcome for linear utility functions with identical slopes and a single discontinuity per bidder-item pair. We show that in many practical situations this does not suffice to adequately model the preferences of the bidders, and we overcome this problem by presenting the first mechanism forpiecewise linearutility functions withnonidentical slopesandmultiple discontinuities. Our mechanism runs in polynomial time. Like GAM it is incentive compatible for inputs that fulfill a certain nondegeneracy assumption, but our requirement is more general than the requirement of GAM. For discontinuous utility functions that are nondegenerate as well as for continuous utility functions the outcome of our mechanism is acompetitive equilibrium. We also show how our mechanism can be used to compute approximately bidder optimal, envy-free outcomes for a general class of continuous utility functions via piecewise linear approximation. Finally, we prove hardness results for even more expressive settings.", "authors": [{"name": "paul dutting", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453652096"}, {"name": "monika henzinger", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100031872"}, {"name": "ingmar weber", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309503156"}], "title": "An Expressive Mechanism for Auctions on the Web", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "56\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "11\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "56\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Canada", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "london school of economics and political science london united kingdom", "city": "london", "Name": "paul dutting"}, {"country": "Austria", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of vienna vienna austria", "city": "vienna", "Name": "monika henzinger"}, {"country": "Qatar", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "qatar computing research institute doha qatar", "city": "doha", "Name": "ingmar weber"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["N Alon , K A Berman, Regular hypergraphs, Gordon's lemma, Steinitz' lemma and invariant theory, Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series A, v.43 n.1, p.91-97, September 1986[doi>10.1016/0097-3165(86)90026-9]\n", "Noga Alon, Robert Bredereck, Jiehua Chen, Stefan Kratsch, Rolf Niedermeier, and Gerhard J.

Minimum quotas are important in many settings, such as hospital residency matching, military cadet matching, and school choice, but current mechanisms are unable to accommodate them, leading to the use of ad hoc solutions. We introduce two new classes of strategyproof mechanisms that allow for minimum quotas as an explicit input and show that our mechanisms improve welfare relative to existing approaches. Because minimum quotas cause a theoretical incompatibility between standard fairness and nonwastefulness properties, we introduce new second-best axioms and show that they are satisfied by our mechanisms. Last, we use simulations to quantify (1) the magnitude of the potential efficiency gains from our mechanisms and (2) how far the resulting assignments are from the first-best definitions of fairness and nonwastefulness. Combining both the theoretical and simulation results, we argue that our mechanisms will improve the performance of matching markets with minimum quota constraints in practice.", "authors": [{"name": "daniel fragiadakis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81504688656"}, {"name": "atsushi iwasaki", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100065561"}, {"name": "peter troyan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81504688601"}, {"name": "suguru ueda", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81488656839"}, {"name": "makoto yokoo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100257635"}], "title": "Strategyproof Matching with Minimum Quotas", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "54\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "18\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "54\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "texas am university college station tx", "city": null, "Name": "daniel fragiadakis"}, {"country": "Japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of electro-communications tokyo japan", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "atsushi iwasaki"}, {"country": "Honduras", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of virginia charlottesville va", "city": "virginia", "Name": "peter troyan"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "kyushu university", "affiliation_string": "kyushu university fukuoka japan", "city": "fukuoka", "Name": "suguru ueda"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "kyushu university", "affiliation_string": "kyushu university fukuoka japan", "city": "fukuoka", "Name": "makoto yokoo"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["A.

We argue that this is too stringent a requirement and instead ask:how manyvotes does a voting rule need to reconstruct the true ranking? We define the family ofpairwise-majority consistentrules and show that for all rules in this family, the number of samples required from Mallows\u2019s noise model is logarithmic in the number of alternatives, and that no rule can do asymptotically better (while some rules like plurality do much worse). Taking a more normative point of view, we consider voting rules that surely return the true ranking as the number of samples tends to infinity (we call this propertyaccuracy in the limit); this allows us to move to a higher level of abstraction. We study families of noise models that are parameterized by distance functions and find voting rules that are accurate in the limit for all noise models in such general families. We characterize the distance functions that induce noise models for which pairwise-majority consistent rules are accurate in the limit and provide a similar result for another novel family ofposition-dominance consistentrules.

The set of ads that can be assigned to ad slots of the same page needs to satisfy various prespecified constraints including exclusion constraints, diversity constraints, and the like. Upon arrival of a user, the ad serving system needs to allocate a set of ads to the current webpage respecting these per-page allocation constraints. Previous slot-based settings ignore the important concept of a page and may lead to highly suboptimal results in general. In this article, motivated by these applications in display advertising and inspired by the submodular welfare maximization problem with online bidders, we study a general class of page-based ad allocation problems, present the first (tight) constant-factor approximation algorithms for these problems, and confirm the performance of our algorithms experimentally on real-world datasets.A key technical ingredient of our results is a novel primal-dual analysis for handling free disposal, which updates dual variables using a \u201clevel function\u201d instead of a single level and unifies with previous analyses of related problems. This new analysis method allows us to handle arbitrarily complicated allocation constraints for each page. Our main result is an algorithm that achieves a 1 \u2212 frac 1 e \u2212o(1)-competitive ratio. Moreover, our experiments on real-world datasets show significant improvements of our page-based algorithms compared to the slot-based algorithms.Finally, we observe that our problem is closely related to the submodular welfare maximization (SWM) problem. In particular, we introduce a variant of the SWM problem with online bidders and show how to solve this problem using our algorithm for whole-page optimization.", "authors": [{"name": "nikhil r devanur", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100468299"}, {"name": "zhiyi huang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658660520"}, {"name": "nitish korula", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81421593338"}, {"name": "vahab s mirrokni", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100335721"}, {"name": "qiqi yan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81758770457"}], "title": "Whole-Page Optimization and Submodular Welfare Maximization with Online Bidders", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "20\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "20\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "20\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Ghana", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research redmond wa usa", "city": "wa", "Name": "nikhil r devanur"}, {"country": "hong kong", "university": "university of hong kong", "affiliation_string": "the university of hong kong pokfulam hong kong", "city": "xianggangdao", "Name": "zhiyi huang"}, {"country": "United Kingdom", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "google research new york ny usa", "city": "york", "Name": "nitish korula"}, {"country": "United Kingdom", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "google research new york ny usa", "city": "york", "Name": "vahab s mirrokni"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "google research mountain view ca usa", "city": null, "Name": "qiqi yan"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["Avrim Blum, Cynthia Dwork, Frank McSherry, and Kobbi Nissim. 2005.

In these mechanisms, privacy is treated separately from truthfulness; it is not incorporated in players\u2019 utility functions (and doing so has been shown to lead to nontruthfulness in some cases). In this work, we propose a new, general way of modeling privacy in players\u2019 utility functions. Specifically, we only assume that if an outcomeohas the property that any report of playeriwould have led toowith approximately the same probability, thenohas a small privacy cost to playeri. We give three mechanisms that are truthful with respect to our modeling of privacy: for an election between two candidates, for a discrete version of the facility location problem, and for a general social choice problem with discrete utilities (via a VCG-like mechanism). As the numbernof players increases, the social welfare achieved by our mechanisms approaches optimal (as a fraction ofn).", "authors": [{"name": "yiling chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100127631"}, {"name": "stephen chong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548379156"}, {"name": "ian a kash", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331495994"}, {"name": "tal moran", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502744811"}, {"name": "salil vadhan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100534484"}], "title": "Truthful Mechanisms for Agents That Value Privacy", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "36\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "36\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "36\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "harvard university cambridge ma", "city": "cambridge", "Name": "yiling chen"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "harvard university cambridge ma", "city": "cambridge", "Name": "stephen chong"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research cambridge uk", "city": "cambridge", "Name": "ian a kash"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "tal moran"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "stephen chong", "city": null, "Name": "salil vadhanharvard university cambridge ma"}]}}, "date": {"month": "April", "year": "2016"}}}, "Volume3": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Article No.: 22": {"references": ["Robert J.

Departing from previous work, we consider any possible (finite or infinite) domain and general symmetric verification. We identify a natural property, namely, that the correspondence graph of a symmetric verificationMis strongly connected by finite paths along which the preferences are consistent with the preferences at the endpoints, and prove that this property is sufficient for the equivalence of truthfulness andM-truthfulness. In fact, defining appropriate versions of this property, we obtain this result for deterministic and randomized mechanisms with and without money. Moreover, we show that a slightly relaxed version of this property is also necessary for the equivalence of truthfulness andM-truthfulness. Our conditions provide a generic and convenient way of checking whether truthful implementation can take advantage of any symmetric verification scheme in any (finite or infinite) domain. Since the simplest symmetric verification is the local verification, specific cases of our result are closely related, in the case without money, to the research about the equivalence of local truthfulness and global truthfulness. To complete the picture, we consider asymmetric verification and prove that a social choice function isM-truthfully implementable by some asymmetric verificationMif and only iffdoes not admit a cycle of profitable deviations.", "authors": [{"name": "dimitris fotakis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100073283"}, {"name": "emmanouil zampetakis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658729420"}], "title": "Truthfulness Flooded Domains and the Power of Verification for Mechanism Design", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "33\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "33\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "greece", "university": "university of athens", "affiliation_string": "national technical university of athens athens greece", "city": "athens", "Name": "dimitris fotakis"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "massachusetts institute of technology cambridge ma", "city": "cambridge", "Name": "emmanouil zampetakis"}]}, "Article No.: 18": {"references": ["Gagan Aggarwal , Jon Feldman , S.

We prove a negative result showing that this is unavoidable: any mechanism that is myopically strategyproof for agents of all risk types, while also satisfying other natural properties of sequential forecasting mechanisms, must sometimes result in a player getting an exponentially small expected normalized reward.", "authors": [{"name": "stanko dimitrov", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310480888"}, {"name": "rahul sami", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100010954"}, {"name": "marina a epelman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100269496"}], "title": "Subsidized Prediction Mechanisms for Risk-Averse Agents", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "51\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "51\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "canada", "university": "university of waterloo", "affiliation_string": "university of waterloo", "city": "waterloo", "Name": "stanko dimitrov"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "rahul sami"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "marina a epelman"}]}, "Article No.: 19": {"references": ["Saeed Alaei , Hu Fu , Nima Haghpanah , Jason Hartline , Azarakhsh Malekian, Bayesian optimal auctions via multi- to single-agent reduction, Proceedings of the 13th ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce, June 04-08, 2012, Valencia, Spain[doi>10.1145/2229012.2229017]\n", "Yang Cai , Constantinos Daskalakis , S.

We propose a new way of assigning costs to players with weights in congestion games that recovers the important properties of the unweighted model. This method is derived from the Shapley value, and it always induces a game with a (weighted) potential function. For the special cases of weighted network cost-sharing and weighted routing games with Shapley value-based cost shares, we prove tight bounds on the worst-case inefficiency of equilibria.

In a recent paper, Ghodsi et al. [2011] introduced thedominant resource fairness(DRF) mechanism, which was shown to possess highly desirable theoretical properties under Leontief preferences. We extend their results in three directions. First, we show that DRF generalizes to more expressive settings, and leverage a new technical framework to formally extend its guarantees. Second, we study the relation between social welfare and properties such as truthfulness; DRF performs poorly in terms of social welfare, but we show that this is an unavoidable shortcoming that is shared by every mechanism that satisfies one of three basic properties. Third, and most importantly, we study a realistic setting that involves indivisibilities. We chart the boundaries of the possible in this setting, contributing a new relaxed notion of fairness and providing both possibility and impossibility results.", "authors": [{"name": "david c parkes", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100009066"}, {"name": "ariel d procaccia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81318490750"}, {"name": "nisarg shah", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81482646503"}], "title": "Beyond Dominant Resource Fairness: Extensions, Limitations, and Indivisibilities", "citations": [{"Name": "David Kurokawa ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ariel D.

In weighted congestion games with linear latency functions, the existence of pure Nash equilibria is guaranteed by a potential function argument. Unfortunately, this proof of existence is inefficient and computing pure Nash equilibria in such games is a PLS-hard problem even when all players have unit weights. The situation gets worse when superlinear (e.g., quadratic) latency functions come into play; in this case, the Nash dynamics of the game may contain cycles and pure Nash equilibria may not even exist. Given these obstacles, we consider approximate pure Nash equilibria as alternative solution concepts. A\u03c1--approximate pure Nash equilibrium is a state of a (weighted congestion) game from which no player has any incentive to deviate in order to improve her cost by a multiplicative factor higher than\u03c1. Do such equilibria exist for small values of\u03c1? And if so, can we compute them efficiently?We provide positive answers to both questions for weighted congestion games with polynomial latency functions by exploiting an \u201capproximation\u201d of such games by a new class of potential games that we call\u03a8-games. This allows us to show that these games have d!-approximate pure Nash equilibria, wheredis the maximum degree of the latency functions. Our main technical contribution is an efficient algorithm for computing O(1)-approximate pure Nash equilibria whendis a constant. For games with linear latency functions, the approximation guarantee is 3+\u221a5/2 + O\u03b3for arbitrarily small\u03b3> 0; for latency functions with maximum degreed\u2265 2, it isd2d+o(d). The running time is polynomial in the number of bits in the representation of the game and 1/\u03b3. As a byproduct of our techniques, we also show the following interesting structural statement for weighted congestion games with polynomial latency functions of maximum degreed\u2265 2: polynomially-long sequences of best-response moves from any initial state to adO(d2)-approximate pure Nash equilibrium exist and can be efficiently identified in such games as long asdis a constant.To the best of our knowledge, these are the first positive algorithmic results for approximate pure Nash equilibria in weighted congestion games. Our techniques significantly extend our recent work on unweighted congestion games through the use of\u03a8-games. The concept of approximating nonpotential games by potential ones is interesting in itself and might have further applications.", "authors": [{"name": "ioannis caragiannis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548011496"}, {"name": "angelo fanelli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100180046"}, {"name": "nick gravin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453662072"}, {"name": "alexander skopalik", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351607975"}], "title": "Approximate Pure Nash Equilibria in Weighted Congestion Games: Existence, Efficient Computation, and Structure", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "67\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "69\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "greece", "university": "university of patras", "affiliation_string": "university of patras  cti diophantus", "city": "patrai", "Name": "ioannis caragiannis"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cnrs", "city": null, "Name": "angelo fanelli"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research new england", "city": null, "Name": "nick gravin"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of paderborn", "city": null, "Name": "alexander skopalik"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2742678", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "kevin leyton-brown", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100379466"}, {"name": "panos ipeirotis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100225930"}], "title": "Introduction to the Special Issue on EC\u201912", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "45\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "49\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "canada", "university": "university of british columbia", "affiliation_string": "university of british columbia canada", "city": "vancouver", "Name": "kevin leyton-brown"}, {"country": "United Kingdom", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "new york univeristy usa", "city": "york", "Name": "panos ipeirotis"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Ittai Abraham , Moshe Babaioff , Shaddin Dughmi , Tim Roughgarden, Combinatorial auctions with restricted complements, Proceedings of the 13th ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce, June 04-08, 2012, Valencia, Spain[doi>10.1145/2229012.2229016]\n", "Ashlagi, I., Braverman, M., Hassidim, A., and Monderer, D. 2010.

By replacing the incentive compatibility requirement with the goal of minimizing expected ex post regret, we are able to adapt statistical machine learning techniques to the design of payment rules. This computational approach to mechanism design is applicable to domains with multi-dimensional types and situations where computational efficiency is a concern. Specifically, given an outcome rule and access to a type distribution, we train a support vector machine with a specific structure imposed on the discriminant function, such that it implicitly learns a corresponding payment rule with desirable incentive properties. We extend the framework to adopt succinctk-wise dependent valuations, leveraging a connection with maximumaposterioriassignment on Markov networks to enable training to scale up to settings with a large number of items; we evaluate this construction in the case where k=2. We present applications to multiparameter combinatorial auctions with approximate winner determination, and the assignment problem with an egalitarian outcome rule. Experimental results demonstrate that the construction produces payment rules with low ex post regret, and that penalizing classification error is effective in preventing failures of ex post individual rationality.", "authors": [{"name": "paul dutting", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453652096"}, {"name": "felix fischer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100312143"}, {"name": "pichayut jirapinyo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502800421"}, {"name": "john k lai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81501656085"}, {"name": "benjamin lubin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100509281"}, {"name": "david c parkes", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100009066"}], "title": "Payment Rules through Discriminant-Based Classifiers", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "47\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "49\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "stanford university", "city": null, "Name": "paul dutting"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of cambridge", "affiliation_string": "university of cambridge", "city": "cambridge", "Name": "felix fischer"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "pichayut jirapinyo"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "john k laiharvard university"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "benjamin lubinboston university"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "benjamin lubin", "city": null, "Name": "david c parkesharvard university"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Sebastian Aland , Dominic Dumrauf , Martin Gairing , Burkhard Monien , Florian Schoppmann, Exact Price of Anarchy for Polynomial Congestion Games, SIAM Journal on Computing, v.40 n.5, p.1211-1233, September 2011[doi>10.1137/090748986]\n", "Aumann, R.

A seller haskidentical items for sale and is facingnpotential buyers (\u201cagents\u201d) that are arriving sequentially. Each agent is interested in buying one item. Each agent\u2019s value for an item is an independent sample from some fixed (but unknown) distribution with support [0,1]. The seller offers a take-it-or-leave-it price to each arriving agent (possibly different for different agents), and aims to maximize his expected revenue.We focus on mechanisms that do not use any information about the distribution; such mechanisms are calleddetail-free(orprior-independent). They are desirable because knowing the distribution is unrealistic in many practical scenarios. We study how the revenue of such mechanisms compares to the revenue of the optimal offline mechanism that knows the distribution (\u201coffline benchmark\u201d).We present a detail-free online posted-price mechanism whose revenue is at most O((klogn)2/3) less than the offline benchmark, for every distribution that is regular. In fact, this guarantee holds withoutanyassumptions if the benchmark is relaxed to fixed-price mechanisms. Further, we prove a matching lower bound. The performance guarantee for the same mechanism can be improved toO(\u221aklogn), with a distribution-dependent constant, if the ratiok/nis sufficiently small. We show that, in the worst case over all demand distributions, this is essentially the best rate that can be obtained with a distribution-specific constant.On a technical level, we exploit the connection to multiarmed bandits (MAB). While dynamic pricing with unlimited supply can easily be seen as an MAB problem, the intuition behind MAB approaches breaks when applied to the setting with limited supply. Our high-level conceptual contribution is that even the limited supply setting can be fruitfully treated as a bandit problem.", "authors": [{"name": "moshe babaioff", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100244070"}, {"name": "shaddin dughmi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436598000"}, {"name": "robert kleinberg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100287473"}, {"name": "aleksandrs slivkins", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100473695"}], "title": "Dynamic Pricing with Limited Supply", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "188\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "34\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "192\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research", "city": null, "Name": "moshe babaioff"}, {"country": "Hong Kong", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of southern california", "city": "southern", "Name": "shaddin dughmi"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cornell university", "city": null, "Name": "robert kleinberg"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research", "city": null, "Name": "aleksandrs slivkins"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 16": {"references": ["Noga Alon, Erik D.

Informally, there arenplayers sitting on the network nodes, which attempt to establish a reciprocal communication by activating, thereby incurring a certain cost, any of their incident links. The goal of each player is to have all the other nodes as close as possible in the resulting network, while buying as few links as possible. According to this intuition, any model of the game must then appropriately address a balance between these two conflicting objectives. Motivated by the fact that a player might have a strong requirement about her centrality in the network, we introduce a new setting in which a player who maintains her (maximum or average) distance to the other nodes within a given bound incurs a cost equal to the number of activated edges; otherwise her cost is unbounded. We study the problem of understanding the structure of pure Nash equilibria of the resulting games, which we call MaxBD and SumBD, respectively. For both games, we show that when distance bounds associated with players are nonuniform, then equilibria can be arbitrarily bad. On the other hand, for MaxBD, we show that when nodes have a uniform boundD&geq; 3 on the maximum distance, then theprice of anarchy(PoA) is lower and upper bounded by 2 andO(n1/\u230alog3D\u230b+1), respectively (i.e., PoA is constant as soon asDis \u03a9(n&epsi;), for any &epsi; > 0), while for the interesting caseD&equals;2, we are able to prove that the PoA is \u03a9(&sqrt;n) andO(&sqrt;nlogn).

In many cases, the advertiser obtains value from an ad impression (a viewing by a user) only if it is clicked, and frequently advertisers prefer to pay contingent on this occurring. But at the same time, many publishers demand payment independent of clicks. Arbitragers with good estimates of click-probabilities can resolve this conflict by absorbing the risk and acting as an intermediary, paying the publisher on allocation and being paid only if a click occurs. This article examines the incentives of advertisers and arbitragers and contributes an efficient mechanism with truthful bidding by the advertisers and truthful reporting of click predictions by arbitragers as dominant strategies while, given that a hazard rate condition is satisfied, yielding increased revenue to the publisher. We provide empirical evidence based on bid data from Yahoo's Right Media Exchange suggesting that the mechanism would increase revenue in practice.", "authors": [{"name": "ruggiero cavallo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100605122"}, {"name": "r preston mcafee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100122870"}, {"name": "sergei vassilvitskii", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81322509134"}], "title": "Display Advertising Auctions with Arbitrage", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "80\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "80\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "yahoo new york", "city": null, "Name": "ruggiero cavallo"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "r preston mcafee"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "sergei vassilvitskii"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["A.

It is a well-known fact that no matching mechanism based on a stable matching algorithm can guarantee truthfulness as a dominant strategy for participants. However, we show that in a probabilistic setting where the preference lists on one side of the market are composed of only a constant (independent of the size of the market) number of entries, each drawn from an arbitrary distribution, the number of participants that have more than one stable partner is vanishingly small. This proves (and generalizes) a conjecture of Roth and Peranson [1999]. As a corollary of this result, we show that, with high probability, the truthful strategy is the best response for a random player when the other players are truthful. We also analyze equilibria of the deferred acceptance stable matching game. We show that the game with complete information has an equilibrium in which, in expectation, a (1\u2212o(1)) fraction of the strategies are truthful. In the more realistic setting of a game of incomplete information, we will show that the set of truthful stratiegs form a (1+o(1))-approximate Bayesian-Nash equilibrium for uniformly random preferences. Our results have implications in many practical settings and are inspired by the work of Roth and Peranson [1999] on the National Residency Matching Program.", "authors": [{"name": "nicole immorlica", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100026909"}, {"name": "mohammad mahdian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100332135"}], "title": "Incentives in Large Random Two-Sided Markets", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "66\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "12\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "66\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research", "city": null, "Name": "nicole immorlica"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["E.

Playing a stage-game equilibrium strategy at each time step clearly guarantees safety, and prior work has (incorrectly) stated that it is impossible to simultaneously deviate from a stage-game equilibrium (in hope of exploiting a suboptimal opponent) and to guarantee safety. We show that such profitable deviations are indeed possible specifically in games where certain types of \u201cgift\u201d strategies exist, which we define formally. We show that the set of strategies constituting such gifts can be strictly larger than the set of iteratively weakly-dominated strategies; this disproves another recent assertion which states that all noniteratively weakly dominated strategies are best responses to each equilibrium strategy of the other player. We present a full characterization of safe strategies, and develop efficient algorithms for exploiting suboptimal opponents while guaranteeing safety. We also provide analogous results for extensive-form games of perfect and imperfect information, and present safe exploitation algorithms and full characterizations of safe strategies for those settings as well. We present experimental results in Kuhn poker, a canonical test problem for game-theoretic algorithms. Our experiments show that (1) aggressive safe exploitation strategies significantly outperform adjusting the exploitation within stage-game equilibrium strategies only and (2) all the safe exploitation strategies significantly outperform a (nonsafe) best response strategy against strong dynamic opponents.", "authors": [{"name": "sam ganzfried", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81365598171"}, {"name": "tuomas sandholm", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100367056"}], "title": "Safe Opponent Exploitation", "citations": [{"Name": "Tuomas Sandholm", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "47\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "47\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university", "city": null, "Name": "sam ganzfried"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university", "city": null, "Name": "tuomas sandholm"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["A.

It is oftentimes harder to guarantee truthfulness when solving a problem than it is to solve the problem itself. Even worse, truthfulness can be utterly destroyed by small uncertainties in a mechanism\u2019s outcome. One obstacle is that truthful payments depend on outcomes other than the one realized, such as the lengths of non-shortest-paths in a shortest-path auction. Single-call mechanisms are a powerful tool that circumvents this obstacle: they implicitly charge truthful payments, guaranteeing truthfulness in expectation using only the outcome realized by the mechanism. The cost of such truthfulness is a trade-off between the expected quality of the outcome and the risk of large payments.We study two of the most general domains for truthful mechanisms and largely settle when and to what extent single-call mechanisms are possible. The first single-call construction was discovered by Babaioff et al. [2010] in single-parameter domains. They give a transformation that turns any monotone, single-parameter allocation rule into a truthful-in-expectation single-call mechanism. Our first result is a natural complement to Babaioff et al. [2010]: we give a new transformation that produces a single-call VCG mechanism from any allocation rule for which VCG payments are truthful. Second, in both the single-parameter and VCG settings, we precisely characterize the possible transformations, showing that a wide variety of transformations are possible but that all take a very simple form. Finally, we study the inherent trade-off between the expected quality of the outcome and the risk of large payments. We show that our construction and that of Babaioff et al. [2010] simultaneously optimize a variety of metrics in their respective domains.Our study is motivated by settings where uncertainty in a mechanism renders other known techniques untruthful, and we offer a variety of examples where such uncertainty can arise. In particular, we analyze pay-per-click advertising auctions, where the truthfulness of the standard VCG-based auction is easily broken when the auctioneer\u2019s estimated click-through-rates are imprecise.", "authors": [{"name": "christopher a wilkens", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453659524"}, {"name": "balasubramanian sivan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81464674004"}], "title": "Single-Call Mechanisms", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "41\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "41\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Trinidad and Tobago", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california berkeley", "city": "california", "Name": "christopher a wilkens"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wisconsin madison", "city": null, "Name": "balasubramanian sivan"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Michael Braun and Wendy Moe. 2011.

Previous work has shown that the longer an ad is in view, the more likely a user is to remember it and that there are diminishing returns to increased exposure time [Goldstein et al. 2011]. Since a pricing scheme that is at least partially based on time is more exact than one based solely on impressions, time-based advertising may become an industry standard. We answer an open question concerning time-based pricing schemes: how should time slots for advertisements be divided? We provide evidence that ads can be scheduled in a way that leads to greater total recollection, which advertisers value, and increased revenue, which publishers value. We document two main findings. First, we show that displaying two shorter ads results in more total recollection than displaying one longer ad of twice the duration. Second, we show that this effect disappears as the duration of these ads increases. We conclude with a theoretical prediction regarding the circumstances under which the display advertising industry would benefit if it moved to a partially or fully time-based standard.", "authors": [{"name": "daniel g goldstein", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81485649647"}, {"name": "r preston mcafee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100122870"}, {"name": "siddharth suri", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81758959057"}], "title": "Improving the Effectiveness of Time-Based Display Advertising", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "116\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "12\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "116\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United Kingdom", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research new york city", "city": "york", "Name": "daniel g goldstein"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft corporation redmond", "city": null, "Name": "r preston mcafee"}, {"country": "United Kingdom", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research new york city", "city": "york", "Name": "siddharth suri"}]}, "Article No.: 12": {"references": ["Ittai Abraham , Susan Athey , Moshe Babaioff , Michael Grubb, Peaches, lemons, and cookies: designing auction markets with dispersed information, Proceedings of the fourteenth ACM conference on Electronic commerce, June 16-20, 2013, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA[doi>10.1145/2482540.2482557]\n", "Moshe Babaioff , Robert Kleinberg , Renato Paes Leme, Optimal mechanisms for selling information, Proceedings of the 13th ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce, June 04-08, 2012, Valencia, Spain[doi>10.1145/2229012.2229024]\n", "Dirk Bergemann and Alessandro Bonatti. 2011.

Web publishers today use this technology to share information about the websites a user has visited, making it possible to target advertisements to users based on their prior history. This begs the question: do publishers (who are competitors for advertising money) always have the incentive to share online information? Intuitive arguments as well as anecdotal evidence suggest that sometimes a premium publisher might suffer information sharing through an effect calledinformationleakage: by sharing user information with the advertiser, the advertiser will be able to target the same user elsewhere on cheaper publishers, leading to a dilution of the value of the supply on the premium publishers.The goal of this article is to explore this aspect of online information sharing. We show that, when advertisers are homogeneous in the sense that their relative valuations of users are consistent, publishers always agree about the benefits of cookie matchinginequilibrium: either all publishers\u2019 revenues benefit, or all suffer, from cookie matching. We also show using a simple model that, when advertisers are not homogeneous, the information leakage indeed can occur, with cookie matching helping one publisher\u2019s revenues while harming the other.", "authors": [{"name": "arpita ghosh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329489034"}, {"name": "mohammad mahdian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84758739857"}, {"name": "r preston mcafee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100122870"}, {"name": "sergei vassilvitskii", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81322509134"}], "title": "To Match or Not to Match: Economics of Cookie Matching in Online Advertising", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "156\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "27\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "156\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cornell university", "city": null, "Name": "arpita ghosh"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "google inc", "city": null, "Name": "mohammad mahdian"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft inc", "city": null, "Name": "r preston mcafee"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "google inc", "city": null, "Name": "sergei vassilvitskii"}]}, "Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Deepak Agarwal, Bee-Chung Chen, and Pradheep Elango. 2009.

The standard approach is to solve each problem in isolation, for example, by displaying content that is tailored to the user\u2019s interests so as to maximizeclickthroughrates(CTR), and also by building a standalone ad serving system that displays ads depending on the user\u2019s characteristics, the article being viewed by the user, and advertiser-specified constraints. However, showing the user only those articles with highest expected CTR precludes the display of some ads; if the publisher had previously guaranteed the delivery of a certain volume of impressions to such ads, thenunderdeliverypenalties might have to be paid. We propose a joint optimization of article selection and ad serving that minimizes underdelivery byshapingsome of the incoming traffic to pages where underperforming ads can be displayed, while incurring only minor drops in CTR. In addition to formulating the problem, we design an online optimization algorithm that can find the optimal traffic shaping probabilities for each new user using only a cache of one number per ad contract. Experiments on a large real-world ad-serving Web portal demonstrate significant advantages over the standalone approach: a threefold reduction in underdelivery with only 10% drop in CTR, or a 2.6-fold reduction with a 4% CTR drop, and similar results over a wide range.", "authors": [{"name": "deepayan chakrabarti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100424530"}, {"name": "erik vee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100496129"}], "title": "Traffic Shaping to Optimize Ad Delivery", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "50\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "50\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of texas austin", "city": null, "Name": "deepayan chakrabarti"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "google inc", "city": null, "Name": "erik vee"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["Akcoglu, K., Aspnes, J., DasGupta, B., and Kao, M.-Y. 2002.

This approach covers a large variety of interference models such as, for instance, the protocol model or the recently popular physical model of interference. For unweighted conflict graphs and symmetric valuations we use LP-rounding to obtainO(\u03c1)-approximate mechanisms; for weighted conflict graphs we get a factor ofO(\u03c1\u00b7 (logn+ logk)). For submodular users we combine the convex rounding framework of Dughmi et al.

This class of games is a useful abstraction for a number of realistic settings and economic situations, such as modeling relationships in social networks. To date, two main extensions of the Shapley value have been proposed for generalized characteristic function games: the Nowak-Radzik [1994] value and the S\u00e1nchez-Berganti\u00f1os [1997] value. In this context, the present article studies generalized characteristic function games from the point of view of implementation and computation. Specifically, the article makes two key contributions. First, building upon the mechanism by Dasgupta and Chiu [1998], we present a non-cooperative mechanism that implements both the Nowak-Radzik value and the S\u00e1nchez-Berganti\u00f1os value in Subgame-Perfect Nash Equilibria in expectations. Second, in order to facilitate an efficient computation supporting the implementation mechanism, we propose the Generalized Marginal-Contribution Nets representation for this type of game. This representation extends the results of Ieong and Shoham [2005] and Elkind et al. [2009] for characteristic function games and retains their attractive computational properties.", "authors": [{"name": "tomasz p michalak", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436592907"}, {"name": "piotr l szczepanski", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81504684503"}, {"name": "talal rahwan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81421597981"}, {"name": "agata chrobak", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658647284"}, {"name": "simina branzei", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436600626"}, {"name": "michael wooldridge", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100253812"}, {"name": "nicholas r jennings", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100581072"}], "title": "Implementation and Computation of a Value for Generalized Characteristic Function Games", "citations": [{"Name": "Piotr L.

The agents seek to minimize their connection cost, namely the distance of their true location to the nearest facility, and may misreport their location. We are interested in deterministic mechanisms that are strategyproof, that is, ensure that no agent can benefit from misreporting her location, do not resort to monetary transfers, and achieve a bounded approximation ratio to the total connection cost of the agents (or to theLpnorm of the connection costs, for somep\u2208 [1, \u221e) or forp= \u221e).Our main result is an elegant characterization of deterministic strategyproof mechanisms with a bounded approximation ratio for 2-Facility Location on the line. In particular, we show that for instances withn\u2265 5 agents, any such mechanism either admits a unique dictator or always places the facilities at the leftmost and the rightmost location of the instance. As a corollary, we obtain that the best approximation ratio achievable by deterministic strategyproof mechanisms for the problem of locating 2 facilities on the line to minimize the total connection cost is preciselyn-2. Another rather surprising consequence is that the Two-Extremes mechanism of Procaccia and Tennenholtz [2009] is the only deterministic anonymous strategyproof mechanism with a bounded approximation ratio for 2-Facility Location on the line.The proof of the characterization employs several new ideas and technical tools, which provide new insights into the behavior of deterministic strategyproof mechanisms forK-Facility Location games and may be of independent interest. Employing one of these tools, we show that for everyK\u2265 3, there do not exist any deterministic anonymous strategyproof mechanisms with a bounded approximation ratio forK-Facility Location on the line, even for simple instances withK&plus;1 agents. Moreover, building on the characterization for the line, we show that there do not exist any deterministic strategyproof mechanisms with a bounded approximation ratio for 2-Facility Location and instances withn\u2265 3 agents located in a star.", "authors": [{"name": "dimitris fotakis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100073283"}, {"name": "christos tzamos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81479661850"}], "title": "On the Power of Deterministic Mechanisms for Facility Location Games", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "33\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "55\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "greece", "university": "university of athens", "affiliation_string": "national technical university of athens athens greece", "city": "athens", "Name": "dimitris fotakis"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "massachusetts institute of technology cambridge ma", "city": "cambridge", "Name": "christos tzamos"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Sebastian Aland , Dominic Dumrauf , Martin Gairing , Burkhard Monien , Florian Schoppmann, Exact Price of Anarchy for Polynomial Congestion Games, SIAM Journal on Computing, v.40 n.5, p.1211-1233, September 2011[doi>10.1137/090748986]\n", "Elliot Anshelevich , Anirban Dasgupta , Jon Kleinberg , \u00c9va Tardos , Tom Wexler , Tim Roughgarden, The Price of Stability for Network Design with Fair Cost Allocation, SIAM Journal on Computing, v.38 n.4, p.1602-1623, July 2008[doi>10.1137/070680096]\n", "Baruch Awerbuch , Yossi Azar , Amir Epstein, The Price of Routing Unsplittable Flow, Proceedings of the thirty-seventh annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing, May 22-24, 2005, Baltimore, MD, USA[doi>10.1145/1060590.1060599]\n", "A.

One noteworthy by-product of our proofs is the fact that weighted congestion games are \u201ctight,\u201d which implies that the worst-case price of anarchy with respect to pure Nash equilibria, mixed Nash equilibria, correlated equilibria, and coarse correlated equilibria are always equal (under mild conditions on the allowable cost functions). Another is the fact that, like nonatomic but unlike atomic (unweighted) congestion games, weighted congestion games with trivial structure already realize the worst-case POA, at least for polynomial cost functions.We also prove a new result about unweighted congestion games: the worst-case price of anarchy in symmetric games is as large as in their more general asymmetric counterparts.", "authors": [{"name": "kshipra bhawalkar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81472655210"}, {"name": "martin gairing", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100174662"}, {"name": "tim roughgarden", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81342509525"}], "title": "Weighted Congestion Games: The Price of Anarchy, Universal Worst-Case Examples, and Tightness", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "35\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "71\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "stanford university ca", "city": null, "Name": "kshipra bhawalkar"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of liverpool", "affiliation_string": "university of liverpool liverpool uk", "city": "liverpool", "Name": "martin gairing"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "stanford university ca", "city": null, "Name": "tim roughgarden"}]}, "Article No.: 17": {"references": ["Heiner Ackermann , Heiko R\u00f6glin , Berthold V\u00f6cking, Pure nash equilibria in player-specific and weighted congestion games, Proceedings of the Second international conference on Internet and Network Economics, p.50-61, December 15-17, 2006, Patras, Greece[doi>10.1007/11944874_6]\n", "A.

We model altruistic behavior by assuming that playeri's perceived cost is a convex combination of \u03b1itimes his direct cost and \u03b1itimes the social cost. Tuning the parameters \u03b1iallows smooth interpolation between purely selfish and purely altruistic behavior. Within this framework, we study primarily altruistic extensions of (atomic and nonatomic) congestion games, but also obtain some results on fair cost-sharing games and valid utility games.We derive (tight) bounds on the price of anarchy of these games for several solution concepts. Thereto, we suitably adapt thesmoothnessnotion introduced by Roughgarden and show that it captures the essential properties to determine therobust price of anarchyof these games. Our bounds show that for atomic congestion games and cost-sharing games, the robust price of anarchy gets worse with increasing altruism, while for valid utility games, it remains constant and is not affected by altruism.However, the increase in the price of anarchy is not a universal phenomenon: For general nonatomic congestion games with uniform altruism, the price of anarchy improves with increasing altruism. For atomic and nonatomic symmetric singleton congestion games, we derive bounds on the pure price of anarchy that improve as theaveragelevel of altruism increases. (For atomic games, we only derive such bounds when cost functions are linear.) Since the bounds are also strictly lower than the robust price of anarchy, these games exhibit natural examples in which pure Nash equilibria are more efficient than more permissive notions of equilibrium.", "authors": [{"name": "po-an chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=88158967557"}, {"name": "bart de keijzer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658647253"}, {"name": "david kempe", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100444121"}, {"name": "guido schafer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100656566"}], "title": "Altruism and Its Impact on the Price of Anarchy", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "40\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "80\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "taiwan", "university": "national chiao tung university", "affiliation_string": "national chiao tung university taiwan", "city": "jiayi", "Name": "po-an chen"}, {"country": "Netherlands", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cwi amsterdam the netherlands", "city": "amsterdam", "Name": "bart de keijzer"}, {"country": "Hong Kong", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of southern california usa", "city": "southern", "Name": "david kempe"}, {"country": "Netherlands", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cwi amsterdam and vu university amsterdam the netherlands", "city": "amsterdam", "Name": "guido schafer"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["E.

One simple and natural approach is to centrally broadcast nonbinding advice intended to guide the system to a socially near-optimal state while still harnessing the incentives of individual agents. The analytical challenge is proving fast convergence to near optimal states, and in this article we give the first results that carefully constructed advice vectors yield stronger guarantees.We apply this approach to a broad family of potential games modeling vertex cover and set cover optimization problems in a distributed setting. This class of problems is interesting because finding exact solutions to their optimization problems is NP-hard yet highly inefficient equilibria exist, so a solution in which agents simply locally optimize is not satisfactory. We show that with an arbitrary advice vector, a set cover game quickly converges to an equilibrium with cost of the same order as the square of the social cost of the advice vector. More interestingly, we show how to efficiently construct an advice vector with a particular structure with costO(logn) times the optimal social cost, and we prove that the system quickly converges to an equilibrium with social cost of this same order.", "authors": [{"name": "maria-florina balcan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81300252501"}, {"name": "sara krehbiel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83458667557"}, {"name": "georgios piliouras", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435609980"}, {"name": "jinwoo shin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=89558854257"}], "title": "Near-Optimality in Covering Games by Exposing Global Information", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "32\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "115\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "georgia", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "georgia institute of technology", "city": null, "Name": "maria-florina balcan"}, {"country": "georgia", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "georgia institute of technology", "city": null, "Name": "sara krehbiel"}, {"country": "georgia", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "georgia institute of technology", "city": null, "Name": "georgios piliouras"}, {"country": "austria", "university": "institute of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "korea advanced institute of science and technology", "city": "klosterneuburg", "Name": "jinwoo shin"}]}}, "date": {"month": "October", "year": "2014"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["S.

All sellers are a-priori identical and strategically signal buyers about the product they sell. In a setting motivated by online advertising in display ad exchanges, where firms use second price auctions, a firm\u2019s strategy is a decision about its signaling scheme for a stream of goods (e.g., user impressions), and a buyer\u2019s strategy is a selection among the firms. In this setting, a single seller will typically provide partial information, and consequently, a product may be allocated inefficiently. Intuitively, competition among sellers may induce sellers to provide more information in order to attract buyers and thus increase efficiency. Surprisingly, we show that such a competition among firms may yield significant loss in consumers\u2019 social welfare with respect to the monopolistic setting. Although we also show that in some cases, the competitive setting yields gain in social welfare, we provide a tight bound on that gain, which is shown to be small with respect to the preceding possible loss.

Providing incentives for cooperation in online communities is particularly challenging because of their unique features: a large population of anonymous agents having asymmetric interests and dynamically joining and leaving the community, operation errors, and agents trying to whitewash when they have a low standing in the community. In this article, we take these features into consideration and propose a framework for designing and analyzing a class of incentive schemes based on rating protocols, which consist of a rating scheme and a recommended strategy. We first define the concept of sustainable rating protocols under which every agent has the incentive to follow the recommended strategy given the deployed rating scheme. We then formulate the problem of designing an optimal rating protocol, which selects the protocol that maximizes the overall social welfare among all sustainable rating protocols. Using the proposed framework, we study the structure of optimal rating protocols and explore the impact of one-sided rating, punishment lengths, and whitewashing on optimal rating protocols. Our results show that optimal rating protocols are capable of sustaining cooperation, with the amount of cooperation varying depending on the community characteristics.", "authors": [{"name": "yu zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81464651921"}, {"name": "jaeok park", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81551380756"}, {"name": "mihaela van der schaar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81313484306"}], "title": "Rating Protocols in Online Communities", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "53\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "263\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Trinidad and Tobago", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california los angeles", "city": "california", "Name": "yu zhang"}, {"country": "korea south", "university": "yonsei university", "affiliation_string": "yonsei university", "city": "soul", "Name": "jaeok park"}, {"country": "Trinidad and Tobago", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california los angeles", "city": "california", "Name": "mihaela van der schaar"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Noga Alon , Erik D.

They showed that if a Nash equilibrium is a tree, the price of anarchy is constant. In this article, we disprove the tree conjecture. More precisely, we show that for any positive integern0, there exists a graph built byn\u2265n0players which contains cycles and forms a nontransient Nash equilibrium, for any\u03b1with 1 <\u03b1\u2264 \u221an/2.

In this article, we prove that the aforementioned random sampling auction obtains at least 1/4 fraction of the optimal revenue for a large class of instances where the number of bids above (or equal to) the optimal sale price is at least 6. We also show that this auction obtains at least 1/4.68 fraction of the optimal revenue for the small class of remaining instances, thus leaving a negligible gap between the lower and upper bound. We employ a mix of probabilistic techniques and dynamic programming to compute these bounds.", "authors": [{"name": "saeed alaei", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436601482"}, {"name": "azarakhsh malekian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81361607360"}, {"name": "aravind srinivasan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100407793"}], "title": "On Random Sampling Auctions for Digital Goods", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "26\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "62\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland", "city": null, "Name": "saeed alaei"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland", "city": null, "Name": "azarakhsh malekian"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland", "city": null, "Name": "aravind srinivasan"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Pablo Daniel Azar , Silvio Micali, Rational proofs, Proceedings of the forty-fourth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing, May 19-22, 2012, New York, New York, USA[doi>10.1145/2213977.2214069]\n", "G.

To compute this reward, a scoring rule queries the distribution X at various states. The number of these queries is thus a natural measure of thecomplexityof the scoring rule.We prove that any bounded and strictly proper scoring rule that is deterministic must make a number of queries to its input distribution that is a quarter of the number of states of the world. When the state space is very large, this makes the computation of such scoring rules impractical. We also show a new stochastic scoring rule that is bounded, strictly proper, and which makes only two queries to its input distribution.

Individuals that own the data incur a cost for their loss of privacy proportional to the differential privacy guarantee given by the analyst at the time of the release. The analyst incentivizes individuals by compensating them, giving rise to aprivacyauction. Motivated by recommender systems, the statistic we consider is a linear predictor function with publicly known weights. The statistic can be viewed as a prediction of the unknown data of a new individual, based on the data of individuals in the database. We formalize the trade-off between privacy and accuracy in this setting, and show that a simple class of estimates achieves an order-optimal trade-off. It thus suffices to focus on auction mechanisms that output such estimates. We use this observation to design a truthful, individually rational, proportional-purchase mechanism under a fixed budget constraint. We show that our mechanism is 5-approximate in terms of accuracy compared to the optimal mechanism, and that no truthful mechanism can achieve a 2\u2009\u2212\u03b5approximation, for any\u03b5>\u20090.", "authors": [{"name": "pranav dandekar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81472646150"}, {"name": "nadia fawaz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81470653459"}, {"name": "stratis ioannidis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100425341"}], "title": "Privacy Auctions for Recommender Systems", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "56\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "113\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "stanford university and technicolor", "city": null, "Name": "pranav dandekar"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "nadia fawaz"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "stratis ioannidis"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["Gagan Aggarwal , Ashish Goel , Rajeev Motwani, Truthful auctions for pricing search keywords, Proceedings of the 7th ACM conference on Electronic commerce, p.1-7, June 11-15, 2006, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA[doi>10.1145/1134707.1134708]\n", "Susan Athey and Glenn Ellison. 2011.

We characterizestrictlyproperdecision making, where experts have an incentive to accurately reveal their beliefs about the outcome of each action. However, strictly proper decision making requires the decision maker use a completely mixed strategy to choose an action. To address this limitation, we consider a second method where the decision maker asks a single expert to recommend an action.

We introduce the study of signaling when conducting a second price auction of a probabilistic good whose actual instantiation is known to the auctioneer but not to the bidders. This framework can be used to model impressions selling in display advertising. We establish several results within this framework. First, we study the problem of computing a signaling scheme that maximizes the auctioneer\u2019s revenue in a Bayesian setting. We show that this problem is polynomially solvable for some interesting special cases, but computationally hard in general. Second, we establish a tight bound on the minimum number of signals required to implement an optimal signaling scheme.

We focus on a generalization of the classical voter model by introducing nodes (stubborn agents) that have a fixed state. We show that the presence of stubborn agents with opposing opinions precludes convergence to consensus; instead, opinions converge in distribution with disagreement and fluctuations. In addition to the first moment of this distribution typically studied in the literature, we study the behavior of the second moment in terms of network properties and the opinions and locations of stubborn agents. We also study the problem of optimal placement of stubborn agents where the location of a fixed number of stubborn agents is chosen to have the maximum impact on the long-run expected opinions of agents.", "authors": [{"name": "ercan yildiz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84758712957"}, {"name": "asuman ozdaglar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81327490750"}, {"name": "daron acemoglu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81327487446"}, {"name": "amin saberi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100527689"}, {"name": "anna scaglione", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100141603"}], "title": "Binary Opinion Dynamics with Stubborn Agents", "citations": [{"Name": "L.

Recent years have seen the design of various truthful approximation mechanisms that rely on payments. In this article, we advocate the reconsideration of highly structured optimization problems in the context of mechanism design. We explicitly argue for the first time that, in such domains, approximation can be leveraged to obtain truthfulness without resorting to payments. This stands in contrast to previous work where payments are almost ubiquitous and (more often than not) approximation is a necessary evil that is required to circumvent computational complexity.We present a case study in approximate mechanism design without money. In our basic setting, agents are located on the real line and the mechanism must select the location of a public facility; the cost of an agent is its distance to the facility. We establish tight upper and lower bounds for the approximation ratio given by strategyproof mechanisms without payments, with respect to both deterministic and randomized mechanisms, under two objective functions: the social cost and the maximum cost. We then extend our results in two natural directions: a domain where two facilities must be located and a domain where each agent controls multiple locations.", "authors": [{"name": "ariel d procaccia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81318490750"}, {"name": "moshe tennenholtz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100560143"}], "title": "Approximate Mechanism Design without Money", "citations": [{"Name": "Paolo Serafino", "Country": "turkey", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Simina Br\u00e2nzei ", "Country": "israel", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ariel D.

Altruistic behavior is modeled by a linear trade-off between selfish and social objectives. Our model can be embedded in the framework of congestion games with player-specific latency functions. Stable states are the pure Nash equilibria of these games, and we examine their existence and the convergence of sequential best-response dynamics. In general, pure Nash equilibria are often absent, and existence is NP-hard to decide. Perhaps surprisingly, if all delay functions are affine, the games remain potential games, even when agents are arbitrarily altruistic. The construction underlying this result can be extended to a class of general potential games and social cost functions, and we study a number of prominent examples. These results give important insights into the robustness of multi-agent systems with heterogeneous altruistic incentives. Furthermore, they yield a general technique to prove that stabilization is robust, even with partly altruistic agents, which is of independent interest.In addition to these results for uncoordinated dynamics, we consider a scenario with a central altruistic institution that can set incentives for the agents. We provide constructive and hardness results for finding the minimum number of altruists to stabilize an optimal congestion profile and more general mechanisms to incentivize agents to adopt favorable behavior. These results are closely related to Stackelberg routing and answer open questions raised recently in the literature.", "authors": [{"name": "martin hoefer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350574405"}, {"name": "alexander skopalik", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351607975"}], "title": "Altruism in Atomic Congestion Games", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "27\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "98\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "max-planck-institut fur informatik", "city": null, "Name": "martin hoefer"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of paderborn", "city": null, "Name": "alexander skopalik"}]}}, "date": {"month": "December", "year": "2013"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Lada A.

The ESP game, developed byy von Ahn and Dabbish [2004], is an example of such a game devised to label images on the web. Since labeling images is a hard problem for computer vision algorithms and can be tedious and time-consuming for humans, the ESP game provides humans with incentive to do useful work by being enjoyable to play. We present a simple game-theoretic model of the ESP game and characterize the equilibrium behavior in our model. Our equilibrium analysis supports the fact that users appear to coordinate on low effort words. We provide an alternate model of user preferences, modeling a change that could be induced through a different scoring method, and show that equilibrium behavior in this model coordinates on high-effort words. We also give sufficient conditions for coordinating on high-effort words to be a Bayesian-Nash equilibrium.

However, due to the presence of computationally-bounded players and the asymptotic nature of cryptographic security, a definition of sequential rationality for this setting has thus far eluded researchers.We propose a new framework for overcoming these obstacles, and provide the first definitions of computational solution concepts that guarantee sequential rationality. We argue that natural computational variants of subgame perfection are too strong for cryptographic protocols. As an alternative, we introduce a weakening called threat-free Nash equilibrium that is more permissive but still eliminates the undesirable \u201cempty threats\u201d of nonsequential solution concepts.To demonstrate the applicability of our framework, we revisit the problem of implementing a mediator for correlated equilibria [Dodis et al 2000], and propose a variant of their protocol that is sequentially rational for a nontrivial class of correlated equilibria. Our treatment provides a better understanding of the conditions under which mediators in a correlated equilibrium can be replaced by a stable protocol.", "authors": [{"name": "ronen gradwohl", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81363595071"}, {"name": "noam livne", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81416601684"}, {"name": "alon rosen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409592873"}], "title": "Sequential rationality in cryptographic protocols", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "31\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "282\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "cambodia", "university": "western university", "affiliation_string": "northwestern university evanston il", "city": "phnum penh", "Name": "ronen gradwohl"}, {"country": "israel", "university": "weizmann institute of science", "affiliation_string": "weizmann institute of science tel-aviv israel", "city": "rehovot", "Name": "noam livne"}, {"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "idc herzliya herzliya israel", "city": "herzliya", "Name": "alon rosen"}]}}, "date": {"month": "January", "year": "2013"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 16": {"references": ["Orna Agmon Ben-Yehuda , Muli Ben-Yehuda , Assaf Schuster , Dan Tsafrir, Deconstructing Amazon EC2 Spot Instance Pricing, Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE Third International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science, p.304-311, November 29-December 01, 2011[doi>10.1109/CloudCom.2011.48]\n", "J\u00f6rn Altmann , Costas Courcoubetis , George D.

We call this thePrice of Uncertaintyand study it in a wide variety of potential games including fair cost-sharing games, set-cover games, routing games, and job-scheduling games. We show that in certain cases, even extremely small fluctuations can have the ability to cause these dynamics to spin out of control and move to states of much higher social cost, whereas in other cases these dynamics are much more stable even to large degrees of fluctuation.We also consider the resilience of these dynamics to a small number of Byzantine players about which no assumptions are made. We show again a contrast between different games. In certain cases (e.g., fair cost-sharing, set-cover, job-scheduling) even a single Byzantine player can cause best-response dynamics to transition from low-cost states to states of substantially higher cost, whereas in others (e.g., the class of\u03b2-nice games, which includes routing, market-sharing and many others) these dynamics are much more resilient.Overall, our work can be viewed as analyzing the inherent resilience orsafetyof games to different kinds of imperfections in player behavior, player information, or in modeling assumptions made.", "authors": [{"name": "maria-florina balcan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81300252501"}, {"name": "avrim blum", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81492652191"}, {"name": "yishay mansour", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81492647371"}], "title": "The Price of Uncertainty", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "30\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "169\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "georgia", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "georgia institute of technology", "city": null, "Name": "maria-florina balcan"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university", "city": null, "Name": "avrim blum"}, {"country": "israel", "university": "tel aviv university", "affiliation_string": "tel aviv university", "city": "tel aviv yafo", "Name": "yishay mansour"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Jacob Abernethy , Yiling Chen , Jennifer Wortman Vaughan, An optimization-based framework for automated market-making, Proceedings of the 12th ACM conference on Electronic commerce, June 05-09, 2011, San Jose, California, USA[doi>10.1145/1993574.1993621]\n", "Shipra Agrawal , Erick Delage , Mark Peters , Zizhuo Wang , Yinyu Ye, A unified framework for dynamic pari-mutuel information market design, Proceedings of the 10th ACM conference on Electronic commerce, July 06-10, 2009, Stanford, California, USA[doi>10.1145/1566374.1566412]\n", "Artzner, P., Delbaen, F., Eber, J., and Heath, D. 1999.

They have been widely and successfully applied in artificial-money settings, like some Internet prediction markets. Automated market makers from the literature suffer from two problems that contribute to their impracticality and impair their use beyond artificial-money settings: first, they are unable to adapt to liquidity, so that trades cause prices to move the same amount in both heavily and lightly traded markets, and second, in typical circumstances, they run at a deficit. In this article, we construct a market maker that is both sensitive to liquidity and can run at a profit. Our market maker has bounded loss for any initial level of liquidity and, as the initial level of liquidity approaches zero, worst-case loss approaches zero. For any level of initial liquidity we can establish a boundary in market state space such that, if the market terminates within that boundary, the market maker books a profit regardless of the realized outcome.", "authors": [{"name": "abraham othman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81448594724"}, {"name": "david m pennock", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100186104"}, {"name": "daniel m reeves", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100228888"}, {"name": "tuomas sandholm", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100367056"}], "title": "A Practical Liquidity-Sensitive Automated Market Maker", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "46\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "184\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university", "city": null, "Name": "abraham othman"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research", "city": null, "Name": "david m pennock"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "daniel m reeves"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "david m pennock", "city": null, "Name": "tuomas sandholmcarnegie mellon university"}]}, "Article No.: 17": {"references": ["Armstrong, M. 2006.

As in today\u2019s markets, the agents do not charge buyers for their services but rather benefit from payments obtained from sellers upon the execution of a transaction. The agents aim at maximizing their expected benefit, taking into consideration the cost incurred by the search and competition dynamics that arise in the multi-agent setting. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of such models, based on search theory principles. The analysis results in a characterization of the buyers\u2019 and agents\u2019 search strategies in equilibrium. The main result of this article is that the use of self-interested comparison-shopping agents can result in a beneficial equilibrium, where both buyers and sellers benefit, in comparison to the case where buyers control the comparison-shopping agent, and the comparison-shopping agents necessarily do not lose. This, despite the fact that the service is offered for free to buyers and its cost is essentially covered by sellers. The analysis generalizes to any setting where buyers can use self-interested agents capable of effectively performing the search (e.g., evaluating opportunities) on their behalf.", "authors": [{"name": "david sarne", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81365596751"}], "title": "Competitive Shopbots-Mediated Markets", "citations": [{"Name": "Chen Hajaj ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "David Sarne", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Avshalom Elmalech ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "David Sarne ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Barbara J.

We further investigate the more traditional best fixed price profit benchmark and show that there are mechanisms that compete with it in any downward-closed settings.", "authors": [{"name": "anna r karlin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100344510"}, {"name": "c thach nguyen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81410594330"}, {"name": "yuval peres", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100478265"}], "title": "Selling in Exclusive Markets: Some Observations on Prior-Free Mechanism Design", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "20\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "145\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of washington", "city": null, "Name": "anna r karlin"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of washington", "city": null, "Name": "c thach nguyen"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research", "city": null, "Name": "yuval peres"}]}, "Article No.: 12": {"references": ["Abernethy, J. and Frongillo, R.

The framework enables the design of computationally efficient markets tailored to an arbitrary, yet relatively small, space of securities with bounded payoff. We prove that any market satisfying a set of intuitive conditions must price securities via a convex cost function, which is constructed via conjugate duality. Rather than deal with an exponentially large or infinite outcome space directly, our framework only requires optimization over a convex hull. By reducing the problem of automated market making to convex optimization, where many efficient algorithms exist, we arrive at a range of new polynomial-time pricing mechanisms for various problems. We demonstrate the advantages of this framework with the design of some particular markets. We also show that by relaxing the convex hull we can gain computational tractability without compromising the market institution\u2019s bounded budget. Although our framework was designed with the goal of deriving efficient automated market makers for markets with very large outcome spaces, this framework also provides new insights into the relationship between market design and machine learning, and into the complete market setting. Using our framework, we illustrate the mathematical parallels between cost-function-based markets and online learning and establish a correspondence between cost-function-based markets and market scoring rules for complete markets.", "authors": [{"name": "jacob abernethy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350570005"}, {"name": "yiling chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100127631"}, {"name": "jennifer wortman vaughan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81458648434"}], "title": "Efficient Market Making via Convex Optimization, and a Connection to Online Learning", "citations": [{"Name": "Xi Alice Gao ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jie Zhang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yiling Chen", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hoda Heidari ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sebastien Lahaie ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "David M.

Externalities pose many issues that are hard to address with traditional techniques; our work shows how to resolve these issues in a specific setting of particular interest. We operate in a Bayesian environment and so assume private values are drawn according to known distributions. We prove that the optimal auction is NP-hard to approximate pointwise, and APX-hard on average. Thus we instead design auctions whose revenue approximates that of the optimal auction.

In this article, we study properties of near-potential games, that is, games that are close in terms of payoffs to potential games, and show that such games admit similar limiting dynamics.We first focus on finite games in strategic form. We introduce a distance notion in the space of games and study the geometry of potential games and sets of games that are equivalent, with respect to various equivalence relations, to potential games. We discuss how, given an arbitrary game, one can find a nearby game in these sets. We then study dynamics in near-potential games by focusing on continuous-time perturbed best response dynamics. We characterize the limiting behavior of this dynamics in terms of the upper contour sets of the potential function of a close potential game and approximate equilibria of the game. Exploiting structural properties of approximate equilibrium sets, we strengthen our result and show that for games that are sufficiently close to a potential game, the sequence of mixed strategies generated by this dynamics converges to a small neighborhood of equilibria whose size is a function of the distance from the set of potential games.In the second part of the article, we study continuous games and show that our approach for characterizing the limiting sets in near-potential games extends to continuous games. In particular, we consider continuous-time best response dynamics and a variant of it (where players update their strategies only if there is at least\u03b5utility improvement opportunity) in near-potential games where the strategy sets are compact and convex subsets of a Euclidean space. We show that these update rules converge to a neighborhood of equilibria (or the maximizer of the potential function), provided that the potential function of the nearby potential game satisfies some structural properties. Our results generalize the known convergence results for potential games to near-potential games.", "authors": [{"name": "ozan candogan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81479661517"}, {"name": "asuman ozdaglar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81327490750"}, {"name": "pablo a parrilo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100543854"}], "title": "Near-Potential Games: Geometry and Dynamics", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "54\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "232\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "massachusetts institute of technology", "city": null, "Name": "ozan candogan"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "massachusetts institute of technology", "city": null, "Name": "asuman ozdaglar"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "massachusetts institute of technology", "city": null, "Name": "pablo a parrilo"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Allen, F. and Babus, A. 2008.

Financial contagion, epidemic disease, the exposure of covert organizations to discovery, and electrical power networks are all settings in which such issues have been articulated.Here we formulate the problem in terms of strategic network formation, and provide asymptotically tight bounds on the welfare of both optimal and stable networks. We find that socially optimal networks are, in a precise sense, situated just beyond a phase transition in the behavior of the cascading failures, and that stable graphs lie slightly further beyond this phase transition, at a point where most of the available welfare has been lost. Our analysis enables us to explore such issues as the trade-offs between clustered and anonymous market structures, and it exposes a fundamental sense in which very small amounts of \u201cover-linking\u201d in networks with contagious risk can have strong consequences for the welfare of the participants.", "authors": [{"name": "lawrence blume", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331489145"}, {"name": "david easley", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331492159"}, {"name": "jon kleinberg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100288264"}, {"name": "robert kleinberg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100287473"}, {"name": "eva tardos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100610119"}], "title": "Network Formation in the Presence of Contagious Risk", "citations": [{"Name": "Othon Michail ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Paul G.

These results show that our techniques can be widely applied and suggest that the PSPACE-completeness of implementing homotopy methods is a general principle.", "authors": [{"name": "paul w goldberg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100491564"}, {"name": "christos h papadimitriou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100635501"}, {"name": "rahul savani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100139820"}], "title": "The Complexity of the Homotopy Method, Equilibrium Selection, and Lemke-Howson Solutions", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "43\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "210\n", "Citation Count": "5\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of liverpool", "affiliation_string": "university of liverpool", "city": "liverpool", "Name": "paul w goldberg"}, {"country": "Trinidad and Tobago", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california at berkeley", "city": "california", "Name": "christos h papadimitriou"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of liverpool", "affiliation_string": "university of liverpool", "city": "liverpool", "Name": "rahul savani"}]}}, "date": {"month": "May", "year": "2013"}}}}}}
