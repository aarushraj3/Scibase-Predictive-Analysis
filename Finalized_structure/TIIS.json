Instead of recognizing gestures only after they have been entirely completed, as happens in classic gesture recognition systems, GIDE exploits the full potential of gestural interaction by tracking gestures continuously and synchronously, allowing users to both control the target application moment to moment and also receive immediate and synchronous feedback about system recognition states. By this means, they quickly learn how to interact with the system in order to develop better performances. Furthermore, rather than learning the predefined gestures of others, GIDE allows users to design their own gestures, making interaction more natural and also allowing the applications to be tailored by users' specific needs. We describe our system that demonstrates these new qualities\u2014that combine to provide fluid gesture interaction design\u2014through evaluations with a range of performers and artists.", "authors": [{"name": "bruno zamborlin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81479649579"}, {"name": "frederic bevilacqua", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100077889"}, {"name": "marco gillies", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100109346"}, {"name": "mark dinverno", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100588827"}], "title": "Fluid gesture interaction design: Applications of continuous recognition for the design of modern gestural interfaces", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "127\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "423\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of london", "affiliation_string": "goldsmiths university of london and ircam stms-cnrs-upmc london uk", "city": "london", "Name": "bruno zamborlin"}, {"country": "France", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ircam stms-cnrs-upmc paris france", "city": "paris", "Name": "frederic bevilacqua"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of london", "affiliation_string": "goldsmiths university of london london uk", "city": "london", "Name": "marco gillies"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of london", "affiliation_string": "goldsmiths university of london london uk", "city": "london", "Name": "mark dinverno"}]}, "Article No.: 25": {"references": ["Ricardo A.

The proposed approach comprises a content-based tag propagation method to address the sparsity and \u201ccold start\u201d problems, which often occur in social tagging systems and decrease the quality of recommendations. The proposed method exploits (a) the content of items and (b) users' tag assignments through a relevance feedback mechanism in order to automatically identify the optimal number of content-based and conceptually similar items. The relevance degrees between users, tags, and conceptually similar items are calculated in order to ensure accurate tag propagation and consequently to address the issue of \u201clearning tag relevance.\u201d Moreover, the ternary relation among users, tags, and items is preserved by performing tag propagation in the form of triplets based on users' personal preferences and \u201ccold start\u201d degree. The latent associations among users, tags, and items are revealed based on a tensor factorization model in order to build personalized item recommendations. In our experiments with real-world social data, we show the superiority of the proposed approach over other state-of-the-art methods, since several problems in social tagging systems are successfully tackled. Finally, we present the recommendation methodology in the multimodal engine of I-SEARCH, where users' interaction capabilities are demonstrated.", "authors": [{"name": "dimitrios rafailidis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418598894"}, {"name": "apostolos axenopoulos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81317490817"}, {"name": "jonas etzold", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81501683667"}, {"name": "stavroula manolopoulou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81487654750"}, {"name": "petros daras", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100320257"}], "title": "Content-based tag propagation and tensor factorization for personalized item recommendation based on social tagging", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "57\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "257\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "apostolos axenopoulos", "city": null, "Name": "dimitrios rafailidis"}, {"country": "estonia", "university": "university of applied sciences", "affiliation_string": "fulda university of applied sciences fulda germany", "city": "tallinn", "Name": "jonas etzold"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "petros daras", "city": null, "Name": "stavroula manolopoulou"}]}, "Article No.: 24": {"references": ["Apple. 2013.

Prior work has demonstrated advantages in terms of learning gains and satisfaction scores when groups learning together online have been supported by conversational agents that employ Balesian social strategies. This prior work raises two important questions that are addressed in this article. The first question is one of generality. Specifically, are the positive effects of the designed support specific to learning contexts&quest; Or are they in evidence in other collaborative task domains as well&quest; We present a study conducted within a collaborative decision-making task where we see that the positive effects of the Balesian social strategies extend to this new context. The second question is whether it is possible to increase the effectiveness of the Balesian social strategies by increasing the context sensitivity with which the social strategies are triggered. To this end, we present technical work that increases the sensitivity of the triggering. Next, we present a user study that demonstrates an improvement in performance of the support agent with the new, more sensitive triggering policy over the baseline approach from prior work.The technical contribution of this article is that we extend prior work where such support agents were modeled using a composition of conversational behaviors integrated within an event-driven framework. Within the present approach, conversation is orchestrated through context-sensitive triggering of the composed behaviors. The core effort involved in applying this approach involves building a set of triggering policies that achieve this orchestration in a time-sensitive and coherent manner. In line with recent developments in data-driven approaches for building dialog systems, we present a novel technique for learning behavior-specific triggering policies, deploying it as part of our efforts to improve a socially capable conversational tutor agent that supports collaborative learning.", "authors": [{"name": "rohit kumar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384597604"}, {"name": "carolyn p rose", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100481340"}], "title": "Triggering effective social support for online groups", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "56\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "231\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "raytheon bbn technologies cambridge ma usa", "city": "cambridge", "Name": "rohit kumar"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa usa", "city": "pittsburgh", "Name": "carolyn p rose"}]}, "Article No.: 21": {"references": ["Tomohiro Amemiya , Jun Yamashita , Koichi Hirota , Michitaka Hirose, Virtual Leading Blocks for the Deaf-Blind: A Real-Time Way-Finder by Verbal-Nonverbal Hybrid Interface and High-Density RFID Tag Space, Proceedings of the IEEE Virtual Reality 2004, p.165, March 27-31, 2004[doi>10.1109/VR.2004.83]\n", "E.

This work describes a system able to guide people with VIs through indoor environments using inexpensive sensors, such as accelerometers and compasses, which are available in portable devices like smart phones. The method takes advantage of feedback from the human user, who confirms the presence of landmarks, something that users with VIs already do when navigating in a building. The system calculates the user's location in real time and uses it to provide audio instructions on how to reach the desired destination. Initial early experiments suggested that the accuracy of the localization depends on the type of directions and the availability of an appropriate transition model for the user. A critical parameter for the transition model is the user's step length. Consequently, this work also investigates different schemes for automatically computing the user's step length and reducing the dependence of the approach on the definition of an accurate transition model. In this way, the direction provision method is able to use the localization estimate and adapt to failed executions of paths by the users. Experiments are presented that evaluate the accuracy of the overall integrated system, which is executed online on a smart phone. Both people with VIs and blindfolded sighted people participated in the experiments, which included paths along multiple floors that required the use of stairs and elevators.", "authors": [{"name": "ilias apostolopoulos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502810783"}, {"name": "navid fallah", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81456625118"}, {"name": "eelke folmer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81377590840"}, {"name": "kostas e bekris", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100299463"}], "title": "Integrated online localization and navigation for people with visual impairments using smart phones", "citations": [{"Name": "Raja S.

It integrates crowds using evolutionary algorithms. The method increases the creativity of ideas across generations, and it works better than greenfield idea generation. Specifically, a design space of internet-scale idea generation systems is defined, and one instance is tested: a crowd idea generation system that uses combination to improve previous designs. The key process of the system is the following: A crowd generates designs, then another crowd combines the designs of the previous crowd. In an experiment with 540 participants, the combined designs were compared to the initial designs and to the designs produced by a greenfield idea generation system. The results show that the sequential combination system produced more creative ideas in the last generation and outperformed the greenfield idea generation system. The design space of crowdsourced idea generation developed here may be used to instantiate systems that can be applied to a wide range of design problems. The work has both pragmatic and theoretical implications: New forms of coordination are now possible, and, using the crowd, it is possible to test existing and emerging theories of coordination and participatory design. Moreover, it may be possible for human designers, organized as a crowd, to codesign with each other and with automated algorithms.", "authors": [{"name": "lixiu yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474683819"}, {"name": "jeffrey v nickerson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100161587"}], "title": "An internet-scale idea generation system", "citations": [{"Name": "Salvatore Andolina ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daniel Lee ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Steven Dow", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Aniket Kittur ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jeffrey V.

We target outdoor environments, aiming to transform a region into a smart environment that can share its cultural heritage with people, promoting itself and its special qualities. Using the applications developed in the framework, people can interact with things, listen to the stories that these things tell them, and make their own contributions. The things are intelligent in the sense that they aggregate information provided by users and behave in a socially active way. They can autonomously establish social relationships on the basis of their properties and their interaction with users. Hence when a user gets in touch with a thing, she is also introduced to its social network consisting of other things and of users; she can navigate this network to discover and explore the world around the thing itself. Thus the system supports serendipitous navigation in a network of things and people that evolves according to the behavior of users. An innovative interaction model was defined that allows users to interact with objects in a natural, playful way using smartphones without the need for a specially created infrastructure.The framework was instantiated into a suite of applications called WantEat, in which objects from the domain of tourism and gastronomy (such as cheese wheels or bottles of wine) are taken as testimonials of the cultural roots of a region. WantEat includes an application that allows the definition and registration of things, a mobile application that allows users to interact with things, and an application that supports stakeholders in getting feedback about the things that they have registered in the system. WantEat was developed and tested in a real-world context which involved a region and gastronomy-related items from it (such as products, shops, restaurants, and recipes), through an early evaluation with stakeholders and a final evaluation with hundreds of users.", "authors": [{"name": "luca console", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100323027"}, {"name": "fabrizio antonelli",

Our approach marries a machine translation system with the popular picture book. Users interact with picoTrans by pointing at pictures as if it were a picture book; the system generates natural language from these icons and the user is able to interact with the icon sequence to refine the meaning of the words that are generated. When users are satisfied that the sentence generated represents what they wish to express, they tap a translate button and picoTrans displays the translation. Structuring the process of communication in this way has many advantages. First, tapping icons is a very natural method of user input on mobile devices; typing is cumbersome and speech input errorful. Second, the sequence of icons which is annotated both with pictures and bilingually with words is meaningful to both users, and it opens up a second channel of communication between them that conveys the gist of what is being expressed. We performed a number of evaluations of picoTrans to determine: its coverage of a corpus of in-domain sentences; the input efficiency in terms of the number of key presses required relative to text entry; and users' overall impressions of using the system compared to using a picture book. Our results show that we are able to cover 74&percnt; of the expressions in our test corpus using a 2000-icon set; we believe that this icon set size is realistic for a mobile device. We also found that picoTrans requires fewer key presses than typing the input and that the system is able to predict the correct, intended natural language sentence from the icon sequence most of the time, making user interaction with the icon sequence often unnecessary. In the user evaluation, we found that in general users prefer using picoTrans and are able to communicate more rapidly and expressively. Furthermore, users had more confidence that they were able to communicate effectively using picoTrans.", "authors": [{"name": "wei song", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81557443656"}, {"name": "andrew finch", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100186839"}, {"name": "kumiko tanaka-ishii", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100162913"}, {"name": "keiji yasuda", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100610706"}, {"name": "eiichiro sumita", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502766558"}], "title": "picoTrans: An intelligent icon-driven interface for cross-lingual communication", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "37\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "180\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "canon inc tokyo japan", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "wei song"}, {"country": "japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of communication technology nict japan", "city": null, "Name": "andrew finch"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "kyushu university", "affiliation_string": "kyushu university japan", "city": "fukuoka", "Name": "kumiko tanaka-ishii"}, {"country": "japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of communication technology nict japan", "city": null, "Name": "keiji yasuda"}, {"country": "japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of communication technology nict japan", "city": null, "Name": "eiichiro sumita"}]}}, "date": {"month": "April", "year": "2013"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 19": {"references": ["Adomavicius, G. and Tuzhilin, A. 2011.

We present a methodology for developing computational models of quality that can assist users in assessing Web resources. The methodology consists of four steps: 1) a meta-analysis of previous studies to decompose quality into high-level dimensions and low-level indicators, 2) an expert study to identify the key low-level indicators of quality in the target domain, 3) human annotation to provide a collection of example resources where the presence or absence of quality indicators has been tagged, and 4) training of a machine learning model to predict quality indicators based on content and link features of Web resources. We find that quality is a multifaceted construct, with different aspects that may be important to different users at different times. We show that machine learning models can predict this multifaceted nature of quality, both in the context of aiding curators as they evaluate resources submitted to digital libraries, and in the context of aiding teachers as they develop online educational resources. Finally, we demonstrate how computational models of quality can be provided as a service, and embedded into applications such as Web search.", "authors": [{"name": "philipp wetzler", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418595603"}, {"name": "steven bethard", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81372591198"}, {"name": "heather leary", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435599254"}, {"name": "kirsten butcher", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332491877"}, {"name": "soheil danesh bahreini", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84459179357"}, {"name": "jin zhao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84458911557"}, {"name": "james h martin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81406597036"}, {"name": "tamara sumner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339531152"}], "title": "Characterizing and Predicting the Multifaceted Nature of Quality in Educational Web Resources", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "35\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "159\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado boulder", "city": null, "Name": "philipp wetzler"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado boulder", "city": null, "Name": "steven bethard"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado boulder", "city": null, "Name": "heather leary"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of utah", "city": null, "Name": "kirsten butcher"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado boulder", "city": null, "Name": "soheil danesh bahreini"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": "national university of singapore", "affiliation_string": "national university of singapore", "city": "singapore", "Name": "jin zhao"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado boulder", "city": null, "Name": "james h martin"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado boulder", "city": null, "Name": "tamara sumner"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Eytan Adar , Jaime Teevan , Susan T.

These systems often rely on people to (1)identify the tasksthey want automated and (2)specify the procedural stepsnecessary to accomplish those tasks (i.e., to create task models). However, our interviews with users of a Web task automation system reveal that people find it difficult to identify tasks to automate and most do not even believe they perform repetitive tasks worthy of automation. Furthermore, even when automatable tasks are identified, the well-recognized difficulties of specifying task steps often prevent people from taking advantage of these automation systems.In this research, we analyze real Web usage data and find that people do in fact repeat behaviors on the Web and that automating these behaviors, regardless of their complexity, would reduce the overall number of actions people need to perform when completing their tasks, potentially saving time. Motivated by these findings, we developed LiveAction, a fully-automated approach to generating task models from Web usage data. LiveAction models can be used to populate the task model repositories required by many automation systems, helping us take advantage of automation in our everyday lives.", "authors": [{"name": "saleema amershi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502661593"}, {"name": "jalal mahmud", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319496986"}, {"name": "jeffrey nichols", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100204766"}, {"name": "tessa lau", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84460004357"}, {"name": "german attanasio ruiz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84459157357"}], "title": "LiveAction: Automating Web Task Model Generation", "citations": [{"Name": "Oscar D\u00edaz ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Crist\u00f3bal Arellano", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "30\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "146\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of washington", "city": null, "Name": "saleema amershi"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm research almaden", "city": null, "Name": "jalal mahmud"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm research almaden", "city": null, "Name": "jeffrey nichols"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "german attanasio ruiz", "city": null, "Name": "tessa lau"}]}, "Article No.: 18": {"references": ["Agnar Aamodt , Enric Plaza, Case-based reasoning: foundational issues, methodological variations, and system approaches, AI Communications, v.7 n.1, p.39-59, March 1994\n", "Adam Anthony , Mitch Raney, Bayesian network analysis of computer science grade distributions, Proceedings of the 43rd ACM technical symposium on Computer Science Education, February 29-March 03, 2012, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA[doi>10.1145/2157136.2157320]\n", "Paolo Avesani , Anna Perini , Francesco Ricci, Interactive Case-Based Planning for Forest Fire Management, Applied Intelligence, v.13 n.1, p.41-57, July-August 2000[doi>10.1023/A:1008327312956]\n", "Bellman, R. 1957.Dynamic Programming.

They provide people with suggestions for items which are likely to be of interest for them; hence, a primary function of recommender systems is to help people make good choices and decisions. However, most previous research has focused on recommendation techniques and algorithms, and less attention has been devoted to the decision making processes adopted by the users and possibly supported by the system. There is still a gap between the importance that the community gives to the assessment of recommendation algorithms and the current range of ongoing research activities concerning human decision making. Different decision-psychological phenomena can influence the decision making of users of recommender systems, and research along these lines is becoming increasingly important and popular. This special issue highlights how the coupling of recommendation algorithms with the understanding of human choice and decision making theory has the potential to benefit research and practice on recommender systems and to enable users to achieve a good balance between decision accuracy and decision effort.", "authors": [{"name": "li chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84458733157"}, {"name": "marco de gemmis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81381593766"}, {"name": "alexander felfernig", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548022696"}, {"name": "pasquale lops", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100585382"}, {"name": "francesco ricci", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100016050"}, {"name": "giovanni semeraro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548022699"}], "title": "Human Decision Making and Recommender Systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Francesco Ricci", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "120\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "23\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "438\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "hong kong", "university": "hong kong baptist university", "affiliation_string": "hong kong baptist university", "city": "jiulong", "Name": "li chen"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of bari", "affiliation_string": "university of bari aldo moro", "city": "bari", "Name": "marco de gemmis"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "graz university of technology", "city": null, "Name": "alexander felfernig"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of bari", "affiliation_string": "university of bari aldo moro", "city": "bari", "Name": "pasquale lops"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "free university of bozen", "affiliation_string": "free university of bozen-bolzano", "city": "bolzano", "Name": "francesco ricci"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of bari", "affiliation_string": "university of bari aldo moro", "city": "bari", "Name": "giovanni semeraro"}]}}, "date": {"month": "October", "year": "2013"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 8": {"references": ["Gregory D.

People today consume information and services on the go, through smart phones applications capable of exploiting their location in order to adapt the content according to the context of use. As location-based services gain traction and reveal their limitations, we argue there is a need for intelligent systems to be created to better support people's activities in their experience of the city, especially regarding their decision-making processes. In this article, we explore the opportunity to move closer to the realization of the ubiquitous computing vision by turning physical places into smart environments capable of cooperatively and autonomously collecting, processing, and transporting information about their characteristics (e.g., practical information, presence of people, and ambience). Following a multidisciplinary approach which leverages psychology, design, and computer science, we propose to investigate the potential of building communication and interaction spaces, calledinformation spheres, on top of physical places such as businesses, homes, and institutions. We argue that, if the latter are exposed on the Web, they can act as a platform delivering information and services and mediating interactions with smart objects without requiring too much effort for the deployment of the architecture. After presenting the inherent challenges of our vision, we go through the protocol of two preliminary experiments that aim to evaluate users' perception of different types of information (i.e., reviews, check-in information, video streams, and real-time representations) and their influence on the decision-making process. Results of this study lead us to elaborate the design considerations that must be taken into account to ensure the intelligibility and user acceptance of information spheres. We finally describe a research prototype application calledEnvironment Browser (Env-B)and present the underlying smart space middleware, before evaluating the user experience with our system through quantitative and qualitative methods.", "authors": [{"name": "pierrick thebault", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81479641591"}, {"name": "dominique decotter", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81486654893"}, {"name": "mathieu boussard", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81486644695"}, {"name": "monique lu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82458671057"}], "title": "Embodying services into physical places: Toward the design of a mobile environment browser", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "82\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "356\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "France", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "alcatel-lucent bell labs france arts et metiers paristech", "city": "france", "Name": "pierrick thebault"}, {"country": "france", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "alcatel-lucent bell labs france", "city": null, "Name": "dominique decotter"}, {"country": "france", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "alcatel-lucent bell labs france", "city": null, "Name": "mathieu boussard"}, {"country": "france", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "alcatel-lucent bell labs france", "city": null, "Name": "monique lu"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2499474.2499479", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "This editorial introduction first explains the origin of this special section.

We propose to redress this input-output imbalance by augmentation of smart objects with projected displays, that\u2014unlike physical displays\u2014allow seamless integration with the natural appearance of an object. In this article, we investigate how, in a ubiquitous computing world, smart objects can acquire and control a projection. We consider that projectors and cameras are ubiquitous in the environment, and we develop a novel conception and system that enables smart objects to spontaneously associate with projector-camera systems for cooperative augmentation. Projector-camera systems are conceived as generic, supporting standard computer vision methods for different appearance cues, and smart objects provide a model of their appearance for method selection at runtime, as well as sensor observations to constrain the visual detection process. Cooperative detection results in accurate location and pose of the object, which is then tracked for visual augmentation in response to display requests by the smart object. In this article, we define the conceptual framework underlying our approach; report on computer vision experiments that give original insight into natural appearance-based detection of everyday objects; show how object sensing can be used to increase speed and robustness of visual detection; describe and evaluate a fully implemented system; and describe two smart object applications to illustrate the system's cooperative augmentation process and the embodied interactions it enables with smart objects.", "authors": [{"name": "david molyneaux", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81388595328"}, {"name": "hans gellersen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452616827"}, {"name": "joe finney", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100156307"}], "title": "Cooperative augmentation of mobile smart objects with projected displays", "citations": [{"Name": "Clara Mancini ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Janet van der Linden ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gerd Kortuem ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Guy Dewsbury ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daniel Mills ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Paula Boyden", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "86\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "434\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "lancaster university uk", "city": null, "Name": "david molyneaux"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "lancaster university uk", "city": null, "Name": "hans gellersen"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "lancaster university uk", "city": null, "Name": "joe finney"}]}, "Article No.: 12": {"references": ["Allwood, J. 1976.

Hence, the key challenge for making smart objects successful is to design usable and useful interactions with them.

Understanding this input-output relation (IO relation) is a prerequisite for the design of meaningful interaction. A meaningful IO relation allows the user to know what to do with a system to achieve a certain goal and to evaluate the outcome. The work discussed in this article followed a design research process in which four concepts were developed and prototyped. An evaluation was performed using these prototypes to investigate the effect of highly different IO relations on the user's understanding of the interaction. The evaluation revealed two types of IO relations differing in functionality and the number of mappings between the user and system actions. These two types of relations are described by two IO models that provide an overview of these mappings. Furthermore, they illustrate the role of the user and the influence of the system in the process of understanding the interaction. The analysis of the two types of IO models illustrates the value of understanding IO relations for the design of smart tangible objects.", "authors": [{"name": "evelien van de garde-perik", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350598144"}, {"name": "serge offermans", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81488663865"}, {"name": "koen van boerdonk", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81385600211"}, {"name": "kars-michiel lenssen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82458776957"}, {"name": "elise van den hoven", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384611571"}], "title": "An analysis of input-output relations in interaction with smart tangible objects", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "46\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "215\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "netherlands", "university": "eindhoven university of technology", "affiliation_string": "eindhoven university of technology the netherlands", "city": "eindhoven", "Name": "evelien van de garde-perik"}, {"country": "netherlands", "university": "eindhoven university of technology", "affiliation_string": "eindhoven university of technology the netherlands", "city": "eindhoven", "Name": "serge offermans"}, {"country": "netherlands", "university": "eindhoven university of technology", "affiliation_string": "eindhoven university of technology the netherlands", "city": "eindhoven", "Name": "koen van boerdonk"}, {"country": "Turkey", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "elise van den hoven", "city": "van", "Name": "kars-michiel lenssen"}]}}, "date": {"month": "July", "year": "2013"}}}, "Volume6": {"Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 8": {"references": ["Rakesh Agrawal , Tomasz Imieli\u0144ski , Arun Swami, Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases, Proceedings of the 1993 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data, p.207-216, May 25-28, 1993, Washington, D.C., USA[doi>10.1145/170035.170072]\n", "Szymon Bobek, Mateusz Baran, Krzysztof Kluza, and Grzegorz J.

RapidMiner is a widely used software tool for the development and execution of such analytics workflows. Unlike many other algorithm toolkits, it comprises a visual editor that allows the user to design processes on a conceptual level. This conceptual and visual approach helps the user to abstract from the technical details during the development phase and to retain a focus on the core modeling task. The large set of preimplemented data analysis and machine learning operations available in the tool, as well as their logical dependencies, can, however, be overwhelming in particular for novice users.In this work, we present an add-on to the RapidMiner framework that supports the user during the modeling phase by recommending additional operations to insert into the currently developed machine learning workflow. First, we propose different recommendation techniques and evaluate them in an offline setting using a pool of several thousand existing workflows. Second, we present the results of a laboratory study, which show that our tool helps users to significantly increase the efficiency of the modeling process. Finally, we report on analyses using data that were collected during the real-world deployment of the plug-in component and compare the results of the live deployment of the tool with the results obtained through an offline analysis and a replay simulation.", "authors": [{"name": "dietmar jannach", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100081930"}, {"name": "michael jugovac", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658693680"}, {"name": "lukas lerche", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658641476"}], "title": "Supporting the Design of Machine Learning Workflows with a Recommendation System", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "71\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "36\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "71\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "tu dortmund dortmund germany", "city": "dortmund", "Name": "dietmar jannach"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "tu dortmund dortmund germany", "city": "dortmund", "Name": "michael jugovac"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "tu dortmund dortmund germany", "city": "dortmund", "Name": "lukas lerche"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["David Andrzejewski , Xiaojin Zhu , Mark Craven, Incorporating domain knowledge into topic modeling via Dirichlet Forest priors, Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Conference on Machine Learning, p.25-32, June 14-18, 2009, Montreal, Quebec, Canada[doi>10.1145/1553374.1553378]\n", "David M.

Driving intervention in individuals with ASD is a growing area of study, but it is still widely under-researched. We present the development and preliminary assessment of a gaze-contingent adaptive virtual reality driving simulator that uses real-time gaze information to adapt the driving environment with the aim of providing a more individualized method of driving intervention. We conducted a small pilot study of 20 adolescents with ASD using our system: 10 with the adaptive gaze-contingent version of the system and 10 in a purely performance-based version. Preliminary results suggest that the novel intervention system may be beneficial in teaching driving skills to individuals with ASD.", "authors": [{"name": "joshua wade", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82858810957"}, {"name": "lian zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82858804857"}, {"name": "dayi bian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82858761057"}, {"name": "jing fan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658991179"}, {"name": "amy swanson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81556215456"}, {"name": "amy weitlauf", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658977338"}, {"name": "medha sarkar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100596846"}, {"name": "zachary warren", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442614182"}, {"name": "nilanjan sarkar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100596835"}], "title": "A Gaze-Contingent Adaptive Virtual Reality Driving Environment for Intervention in Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "40\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "40\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "40\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "department of electrical engineering and computer science vanderbilt university tn usa", "city": null, "Name": "joshua wade"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "department of electrical engineering and computer science vanderbilt university tn usa", "city": null, "Name": "lian zhang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "department of electrical engineering and computer science vanderbilt university tn usa", "city": null, "Name": "dayi bian"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "department of electrical engineering and computer science vanderbilt university tn usa", "city": null, "Name": "jing fan"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "treatment and research institute for autism spectrum disorders kennedy center vanderbilt university tn usa", "city": null, "Name": "amy swanson"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "treatment and research institute for autism spectrum disorders kennedy center vanderbilt university tn usa", "city": null, "Name": "amy weitlauf"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "department of computer science middle tennessee state university tn usa", "city": null, "Name": "medha sarkar"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "department of pediatrics and psychiatry vanderbilt university tn usa", "city": null, "Name": "zachary warren"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "department of mechanical engineering vanderbilt university tn usa", "city": null, "Name": "nilanjan sarkar"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Olivier Bousquet , Andr\u00e9 Elisseeff, Stability and generalization, The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 2, p.499-526, 3/1/2002[doi>10.1162/153244302760200704]\n", "Carl Brunner , Andreas Fischer , Klaus Luig , Thorsten Thies, Pairwise support vector machines and their application to large scale problems, The Journal of Machine Learning Research, v.13 n.1, p.2279-2292, January 2012\n", "Antonio Camurri , Paolo Coletta , Giovanna Varni , Simone Ghisio, Developing multimodal interactive systems with EyesWeb XMI, Proceedings of the 7th international conference on New interfaces for musical expression, June 06-10, 2007, New York, New York[doi>10.1145/1279740.1279806]\n", "C.

Three-dimensional motion data of full-body movements are obtained either from professional optical motion-capture systems (Qualisys) or from low-cost RGB-D sensors (Kinect and Kinect2). A number of features are then automatically extracted at different levels, from kinematics of a single joint to more global expressive features inspired by psychology and humanistic theories (e.g., contraction index, fluidity, and impulsiveness). An abstraction layer based on dictionary learning further processes these movement features to increase the model generality and to deal with intraclass variability, noise, and incomplete information characterizing emotion expression in human movement. The resulting feature vector is the input for a classifier performing real-time automatic emotion recognition based on linear support vector machines. The recognition performance of the proposed model is presented and discussed, including the tradeoff between precision of the tracking measures (we compare the Kinect RGB-D sensor and the Qualisys motion-capture system) versus dimension of the training dataset. The resulting model and system have been successfully applied in the development of serious games for helping autistic children learn to recognize and express emotions by means of their full-body movement.", "authors": [{"name": "stefano piana", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453628823"}, {"name": "alessandra stagliano", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81482660433"}, {"name": "francesca odone", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100442887"}, {"name": "antonio camurri", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100035696"}], "title": "Adaptive Body Gesture Representation for Automatic Emotion Recognition", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "38\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "38\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "38\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "dibrisuniversita degli studi di genova genova - italy", "city": null, "Name": "stefano piana"}, {"country": "italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "dibrisuniversita degli studi di genova genova - italy", "city": null, "Name": "alessandra stagliano"}, {"country": "italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "dibrisuniversita degli studi di genova genova - italy", "city": null, "Name": "francesca odone"}, {"country": "italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "dibrisuniversita degli studi di genova genova - italy", "city": null, "Name": "antonio camurri"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieli\u0144ski, and Arun Swami. 1993.

Given two groups of event sequence data, researchers test a single hypothesis (e.g., does the group taking Medication A exhibit more deaths than the group taking Medication B?). Recently, however, researchers have been moving toward more exploratory methods of retrospective analysis with existing data. In this article, we begin by showing that the task of cohort comparison is specific enough to support automatic computation against a bounded set of potential questions and objectives, a method that we refer to as High-Volume Hypothesis Testing (HVHT). From this starting point, we demonstrate that the diversity of these objectives, both across and within different domains, as well as the inherent complexities of real-world datasets, still requires human involvement to determine meaningful insights. We explore how visualization and interaction better support the task of exploratory data analysis and the understanding of HVHT results (how significant they are, why they are meaningful, and whether the entire dataset has been exhaustively explored). Through interviews and case studies with domain experts, we iteratively design and implement visualization and interaction techniques in a visual analytics tool, CoCo. As a result of our evaluation, we propose six design guidelines for enabling users to explore large result sets of HVHT systematically and flexibly in order to glean meaningful insights more quickly. Finally, we illustrate the utility of this method with three case studies in the medical domain.", "authors": [{"name": "sana malik", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=86158661357"}, {"name": "ben shneiderman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100146468"}, {"name": "fan du", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87658692957"}, {"name": "catherine plaisant", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100041782"}, {"name": "margret bjarnadottir", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418599364"}], "title": "High-Volume Hypothesis Testing: Systematic Exploration of Event Sequence Comparisons", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "11\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "11\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "11\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland college park md", "city": null, "Name": "sana malik"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland college park md", "city": null, "Name": "ben shneiderman"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland college park md", "city": null, "Name": "fan du"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland college park md", "city": null, "Name": "catherine plaisant"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland college park md", "city": null, "Name": "margret bjarnadottir"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2016"}}}, "Volume4": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Article No.: 19": {"references": ["Robert Axelrod. 1984.

In particular, social intelligence in recognizing affectionate behavior will offer value by allowing companion robots to bond meaningfully with interacting persons. The current article addresses the issue of designing an affectionate haptic interaction between a person and a companion robot by exploring how a small humanoid robot can behave to elicit affection while recognizing touches. We report on an experiment conducted to gain insight into how people perceive three fundamental interactive strategies in which a robot is either always highly affectionate, appropriately affectionate, or superficially unaffectionate (emphasizing positivity, contingency, and challenge, respectively). Results provide insight into the structure of affectionate interaction between humans and humanoid robots\u2014underlining the importance of an interaction design expressing sincere liking, stability and variation\u2014and suggest the usefulness of novel modalities such as warmth and cold.", "authors": [{"name": "martin cooney", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658666407"}, {"name": "shuichi nishio", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81456613369"}, {"name": "hiroshi ishiguro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100572813"}], "title": "Affectionate Interaction with a Small Humanoid Robot Capable of Recognizing Social Touch Behavior", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "107\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "166\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "advanced telecommunications research institute international atr japan", "city": null, "Name": "martin cooney"}, {"country": "japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "advanced telecommunications research institute international atr japan", "city": null, "Name": "shuichi nishio"}, {"country": "japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "advanced telecommunications research institute international atr japan", "city": null, "Name": "hiroshi ishiguro"}]}, "Article No.: 18": {"references": ["M.S.

We describe a template-based recognition method that simultaneously aligns the input gesture to the templates using a Sequential Monte Carlo inference technique. Contrary to standard template-based methods based on dynamic programming, such as Dynamic Time Warping, the algorithm has an adaptation process that tracks gesture variation in real time. The method continuously updates, during execution of the gesture, the estimated parameters and recognition results, which offers key advantages for continuous human--machine interaction. The technique is evaluated in several different ways: Recognition and early recognition are evaluated on 2D onscreen pen gestures; adaptation is assessed on synthetic data; and both early recognition and adaptation are evaluated in a user study involving 3D free-space gestures. The method is robust to noise, and successfully adapts to parameter variation. Moreover, it performs recognition as well as or better than nonadapting offline template-based methods.", "authors": [{"name": "baptiste caramiaux", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81461646439"}, {"name": "nicola montecchio", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81387607836"}, {"name": "atau tanaka", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100132447"}, {"name": "frederic bevilacqua", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100077889"}], "title": "Adaptive Gesture Recognition with Variation Estimation for Interactive Systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Jan C.

Understanding what the user is doing in the environment is important for adapting the environment's behavior, as well as for identifying situations that could be problematic for the user. Enabling the environment to exploit models of the user's most common behaviors is an important step toward this objective. In particular, models of the daily routines of a user can be exploited not only for predicting his/her needs, but also for comparing the actual situation at a given moment with the expected one, in order to detect anomalies in his/her behavior. While manually setting up process models in business and factory environments may be cost-effective, building models of the processes involved in people's everyday life is infeasible. This fact fully justifies the interest of the Ambient Intelligence community in automatically learning such models from examples of actual behavior. Incremental adaptation of the models and the ability to express/learn complex conditions on the involved tasks are also desirable. This article describes how process mining can be used for learning users\u2019 daily routines from a dataset of annotated sensor data. The solution that we propose relies on a First-Order Logic learning approach. Indeed, First-Order Logic provides a single, comprehensive and powerful framework for supporting all the previously mentioned features. Our experiments, performed both on a proprietary toy dataset and on publicly available real-world ones, indicate that this approach is efficient and effective for learning and modeling daily routines in Smart Home Environments.", "authors": [{"name": "berardina de carolis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658675325"}, {"name": "stefano ferilli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339499228"}, {"name": "domenico redavid", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310492888"}], "title": "Incremental Learning of Daily Routines as Workflows in a Smart Home Environment", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "149\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "28\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "192\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "italy", "university": "university of bari", "affiliation_string": "university of bari italy", "city": "bari", "Name": "berardina de carolis"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of bari", "affiliation_string": "university of bari italy", "city": "bari", "Name": "stefano ferilli"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of bari", "affiliation_string": "university of bari italy", "city": "bari", "Name": "domenico redavid"}]}, "Article No.: 16": {"references": ["Ling Bao and Stephen S.

Research in this area has grown alongside advances in sensing and communications, and experiments have yielded sensor traces coupled with ground truth annotations about the underlying environmental conditions and user actions. Traditional machine learning has had some success in recognising human activities; but the need for large volumes of annotated data and the danger of overfitting to specific conditions represent challenges in connection with the building of models applicable to a wide range of users, activities, and environments. We present USMART, a novel unsupervised technique that combines data- and knowledge-driven techniques. USMART uses a general ontology model to represent domain knowledge that can be reused across different environments and users, and we augment a range of learning techniques with ontological semantics to facilitate the unsupervised discovery of patterns in how each user performs daily activities. We evaluate our approach against four real-world third-party datasets featuring different user populations and sensor configurations, and we find that USMART achieves up to 97.5&percnt; accuracy in recognising daily activities.", "authors": [{"name": "juan ye", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658619174"}, {"name": "graeme stevenson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319502073"}, {"name": "simon dobson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100486612"}], "title": "USMART: An Unsupervised Semantic Mining Activity Recognition Technique", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "148\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "35\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "292\n", "Citation Count": "4\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of st andrews", "affiliation_string": "university of st andrews uk", "city": "saint andrews", "Name": "juan ye"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of st andrews", "affiliation_string": "university of st andrews uk", "city": "saint andrews", "Name": "graeme stevenson"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of st andrews", "affiliation_string": "university of st andrews uk", "city": "saint andrews", "Name": "simon dobson"}]}, "Article No.: 17": {"references": ["C.

In such cases, the visitors\u2019 social context has an impact on their museum visit experience. Knowing the social context may allow a system to provide socially aware services to the visitors. Evidence of the social context can be gained from observing/monitoring the visitors\u2019 social behavior. However, automatic identification of a social context requires, on the one hand, identifying typical social behavior patterns and, on the other, using relevant sensors that measure various signals and reason about them to detect the visitors\u2019 social behavior. We present such typical social behavior patterns of visitor pairs, identified by observations, and then the instrumentation, detection process, reasoning, and analysis of measured signals that enable us to detect the visitors\u2019 social behavior. Simple sensors\u2019 data, such as proximity to other visitors, proximity to museum points of interest, and visitor orientation are used to detect social synchronization, attention to the social companion, and interest in museum exhibits. The presented approach may allow future research to offer adaptive services to museum visitors based on their social context to support their group visit experience better.", "authors": [{"name": "eyal dim", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81456636724"}, {"name": "tsvi kuflik", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100095887"}], "title": "Automatic Detection of Social Behavior of Museum Visitor Pairs", "citations": [{"Name": "Eyal Dim ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tsvi Kuflik ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Iris Reinhartz-Berger", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "129\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "228\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "israel", "university": "university of haifa", "affiliation_string": "university of haifa israel", "city": "haifa", "Name": "eyal dim"}, {"country": "israel", "university": "university of haifa", "affiliation_string": "university of haifa israel", "city": "haifa", "Name": "tsvi kuflik"}]}, "Article No.: 21": {"references": ["A.

In an autonomous system, we expect a robot to be able to deal with the whole system of stimuli and to use them to regulate its behavior in real-world applications. The proposed framework contributes to the state of the art of robot planning and high-level control in that it provides a novel perspective on the interaction between robot and environment. Our approach is inspired by Gibson\u2019s constructive view of the concept of a stimulus and by the cognitive control paradigm of task switching. We model the robot\u2019s response to a stimulus in three stages. We start by defining the stimuli as perceptual functions yielded by the active robot processes and learned via an informed logistic regression. Then we model the stimulus-response relationship by estimating a score matrix that leads to the selection of a single response task for each stimulus, basing the estimation on low-rank matrix factorization. The decision about switching takes into account both an interference cost and a reconfiguration cost. The interference cost weighs the effort of discontinuing the current robot mental state to switch to a new state, whereas the reconfiguration cost weighs the effort of activating the response task. A choice is finally made based on the payoff of switching. Because processes play such a crucial role both in the stimulus model and in the stimulus-response model, and because processes are activated by actions, we address also the process model, which is built on a theory of action. The framework is validated by several experiments that exploit a full implementation on an advanced robotic platform and is compared with two known approaches to replanning. Results demonstrate the practical value of the system in terms of robot autonomy, flexibility, and usability.", "authors": [{"name": "mario gianni", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87258619057"}, {"name": "geert-jan m kruijff", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436593209"}, {"name": "fiora pirri", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100588224"}], "title": "A Stimulus-Response Framework for Robot Control", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "92\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "145\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "alcor laboratory diiag sapienza university of rome italy", "city": "rome", "Name": "mario gianni"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "fiora pirri", "city": null, "Name": "geert-jan m kruijff"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "geert-jan m kruijff", "city": null, "Name": "alcor laboratory diiag sapienza university of rome italy"}]}}, "date": {"month": "January", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Leon M.

We introduce an interactive 3D extension of scatterplots called the Regression Cube (RC), which augments a 3D scatterplot with three facets on which the correlations between the two variables are revealed by sensitivity lines and sensitivity streamlines. The sensitivity visualization of local regression on the 2D projections provides insights about the shape of the data through its orientation and continuity cues. We also introduce a series of visual operations such as clustering, brushing, and selection supported in RC. By iteratively refining the selection of data points of interest, RC is able to reveal salient local correlation patterns that may otherwise remain hidden with a global analysis. We have demonstrated our system with two examples and a user-oriented evaluation, and we show how RCs enable interactive visual exploration of multidimensional datasets via a variety of classification and information retrieval tasks.

The unmediated discussion that often ensues during a shared cultural experience, especially when it is with a small group whose members already know each other, has been shown by ethnographers to be important for a more enriching experience. We present DRAMATRIC, a mobile presentation system that delivers hour-long dramas to small groups of museum visitors. DRAMATRIC continuously receives sensor data from the museum environment during a museum visit and analyzes group behavior from that data. On the basis of that analysis, DRAMATRIC delivers a series of dynamically coordinated dramatic scenes about exhibits that the group walks near, each designed to stimulate group discussion. Each drama presentation contains small, complementary differences in the narrative content heard by the different members of the group, leveraging the tension/release cycle of narrative to naturally lead visitors to fill in missing pieces in their own drama by interacting with their fellow group members. Using four specific techniques to produce these coordinated narrative variations, we describe two experiments: one in a neutral, nonmobile environment, and the other a controlled experiment with a full-scale drama in an actual museum. The first experiment tests the hypothesis that narrative differences will lead to increased conversation compared to hearing identical narratives, whereas the second experiment tests whether switching from presenting a drama using one technique to using another technique for the subsequent drama will result in increased conversation. The first experiment shows that hearing coordinated narrative variations can in fact lead to significantly increased conversation. The second experiment also serves as a framework for future studies that evaluate strategies for similar adaptive systems.", "authors": [{"name": "charles callaway", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100150998"}, {"name": "oliviero stock", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81498644730"}, {"name": "elyon dekoven", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100179079"}], "title": "Experiments with Mobile Drama in an Instrumented Museum for Inducing Conversation in Small Groups", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "31\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "144\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "oliviero stock", "city": null, "Name": "charles callaway"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "elyon dekoven", "city": null, "Name": "fbk-irst povo tn italy"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["Gediminas Adomavicius , Alexander Tuzhilin, Using Data Mining Methods to Build Customer Profiles, Computer, v.34 n.2, p.74-82, February 2001[doi>10.1109/2.901170]\n", "Eija Airio, Word normalization and decompounding in mono- and bilingual IR, Information Retrieval, v.9 n.3, p.249-271, June      2006[doi>10.1007/s10791-006-0884-2]\n", "P.

PromotionRank consists of four phases. First, information retrieval techniques are used to map shopping list items onto potentially relevant product categories. Second, since customers typically buy more items than what appear on their shopping lists, the set of potentially relevant categories is expanded using collaborative filtering. Third, we calculate a rank score for each category using a statistical interest criterion. Finally, the available promotions are ranked using the newly computed rank scores. To validate the different phases, we consider 12 months of anonymized shopping basket data from a large national supermarket. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PromotionRank, we also present results from two user studies. The first user study was conducted in a controlled setting using shopping lists of different lengths, whereas the second study was conducted within a large national supermarket using real customers and their personal shopping lists. The results of the two studies demonstrate that PromotionRank is able to identify promotions that are considered both relevant and interesting. As part of the second study, we used PromotionRank to identify relevant promotions to advertise and measure the influence of the advertisements on purchases. The results of this evaluation indicate that PromotionRank is also capable of targeting advertisements, improving sales compared to a baseline that selects random advertisements.", "authors": [{"name": "petteri nurmi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330496266"}, {"name": "antti salovaara", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100551588"}, {"name": "andreas forsblom", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413604613"}, {"name": "fabian bohnert", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384608093"}, {"name": "patrik floreen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100325457"}], "title": "PromotionRank: Ranking and Recommending Grocery Product Promotions Using Personal Shopping Lists", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "91\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "16\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "283\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "finland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "helsinki institute for information technology finland", "city": null, "Name": "petteri nurmi"}, {"country": "finland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "helsinki institute for information technology finland", "city": null, "Name": "antti salovaara"}, {"country": "finland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "helsinki institute for information technology finland", "city": null, "Name": "andreas forsblom"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "monash university", "affiliation_string": "monash university australia", "city": "clayton", "Name": "fabian bohnert"}, {"country": "finland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "helsinki institute for information technology finland", "city": null, "Name": "patrik floreen"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Keith Andrews. 2008.

Timely detection of anomalous objects or situations that need further investigation may reduce operators\u2019 cognitive load. Surveillance applications may include anomaly detection capabilities, but their use is not widespread, as they usually generate a high number of false alarms, they do not provide appropriate cognitive support for operators, and their outcomes can be difficult to comprehend and trust. Visual analytics can bridge the gap between computational and human approaches to detecting anomalous behavior in traffic data, making this process more transparent. As a step toward this goal of transparency, this article presents an evaluation that assesses whether visualizations of normal behavioral models of vessel traffic support two of the main analytical tasks specified during our field work in maritime control centers. The evaluation combines quantitative and qualitative usability assessments. The quantitative evaluation, which was carried out with a proof-of-concept prototype, reveals that participants who used the visualization of normal behavioral models outperformed the group that did not do so. The qualitative assessment shows that domain experts have a positive attitude toward the provision of automatic support and the visualization of normal behavioral models, as these aids may reduce reaction time and increase trust in and comprehensibility of the system.", "authors": [{"name": "maria riveiro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375605061"}], "title": "Evaluation of Normal Model Visualization for Anomaly Detection in Maritime Traffic", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "63\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "196\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Haiti", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "informatics research centre university of skovde sweden", "city": "centre", "Name": "maria riveiro"}]}, "Article No.: 3": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2594648", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "This editorial introduction describes the aims and scope ofACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems's special issue on interactive computational visual analytics.

This approach combines a script language to capture and encode the analytic process and a parametrically controlled symbolic model to represent and reuse the logic of the analysis process. Our approach first appeared in a visual analytics system called CZSaw. Using a script to capture the analyst\u2019s interactions at a meaningful system action level allows the creation of a parametrically controlled symbolic model in the form of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Using the DAG allows propagating changes. Graph nodes correspond to variables in CZSaw scripts, which are results (data and data visualizations) generated from user interactions. The user interacts with variables representing entities or relations to create the next step\u2019s results. Graph edges represent dependency relationships among nodes. Any change to a variable triggers the propagation mechanism to update downstream dependent variables and in turn updates data views to reflect the change. The analyst can reuse parts of the analysis process by assigning new values to a node in the graph. We evaluated this symbolic model approach by solving three IEEE VAST Challenge contest problems (from IEEE VAST 2008, 2009, and 2010). In each of these challenges, the analyst first created a symbolic model to explore, understand, analyze, and solve a particular subproblem and then reused the model via its dependency graph propagation mechanism to solve similar subproblems. With the script and model, CZSaw supports the analytic provenance by capturing, encoding, and reusing the analysis process. The analyst can recall the chronological states of the analysis process with the CZSaw script and may interpret the underlying rationale of the analysis with the symbolic model.", "authors": [{"name": "yingjie victor chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87958868457"}, {"name": "zhenyu cheryl qian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87958852457"}, {"name": "robert woodbury", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100405797"}, {"name": "john dill", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409591991"}, {"name": "chris d shaw", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81496656545"}], "title": "Employing a Parametric Model for Analytic Provenance", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "31\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "88\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "india", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "purdue university indiana usa", "city": null, "Name": "yingjie victor chen"}, {"country": "india", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "purdue university indiana usa", "city": null, "Name": "zhenyu cheryl qian"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "simon fraser university", "affiliation_string": "simon fraser university british columbia canada", "city": "burnaby", "Name": "robert woodbury"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "simon fraser university", "affiliation_string": "simon fraser university british columbia canada", "city": "burnaby", "Name": "john dill"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "simon fraser university", "affiliation_string": "simon fraser university british columbia canada", "city": "burnaby", "Name": "chris d shaw"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["A.

This problem has been addressed either by using function approximation techniques that estimate the approximate true value function of a policy or by using a hierarchical decomposition of a learning task into subtasks. We present a novel approach for dialogue policy optimization that combines the benefits of both hierarchical control and function approximation and that allows flexible transitions between dialogue subtasks to give human users more control over the dialogue. To this end, each reinforcement learning agent in the hierarchy is extended with a subtask transition function and a dynamic state space to allow flexible switching between subdialogues. In addition, the subtask policies are represented with linear function approximation in order to generalize the decision making to situations unseen in training. Our proposed approach is evaluated in an interactive conversational robot that learns to play quiz games. Experimental results, using simulation and real users, provide evidence that our proposed approach can lead to more flexible (natural) interactions than strict hierarchical control and that it is preferred by human users.", "authors": [{"name": "heriberto cuayahuitl", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81443593357"}, {"name": "ivana kruijff-korbayova", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310489559"}, {"name": "nina dethlefs", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81470655170"}], "title": "Nonstrict Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Interactive Systems and Robots", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "49\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "120\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "heriot-watt university united kingdom", "city": null, "Name": "heriberto cuayahuitl"}, {"country": "Haiti", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "german research centre for artificial intelligence germany", "city": "centre", "Name": "ivana kruijff-korbayova"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "heriot-watt university united kingdom", "city": null, "Name": "nina dethlefs"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["David W.

UCWL combines the upper confidence bound (UCB) framework with the soft confidence-weighted (SCW) online learning scheme. In UCB, each instance is classified using both score and uncertainty. For a given instance in the sequence, the algorithm might guess its class label primarily to reduce the class uncertainty. This is a form of informed exploration, which enables the performance to improve with lower sample complexity compared to the case without exploration. Combining UCB with SCW leads to the ability to deal well with noisy and nonseparable data, and state-of-the-art performance is achieved without increasing the computational cost. A potential application setting is human-robot interaction (HRI), where the robot is learning to classify some set of inputs while the human teaches it by providing only binary feedback\u2014or sometimes even the wrong answer entirely. Experimental results in the HRI setting and with two benchmark datasets from other settings show that UCWL outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in the online binary feedback setting\u2014andsurprisinglyeven sometimes outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms that get full feedback (e.g., the true class label), whereas UCWL gets only binary feedback on the same data sequence.", "authors": [{"name": "hung ngo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84458612557"}, {"name": "matthew luciw", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442617978"}, {"name": "jawas nagi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81500645516"}, {"name": "alexander forster", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474690648"}, {"name": "jurgen schmidhuber", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409592380"}, {"name": "ngo anh vien", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81361606917"}], "title": "Efficient Interactive Multiclass Learning from Binary Feedback", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "39\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "182\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "switzerland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "idsia dalle molle institute for artificial intelligence usi-supsi manno-lugano switzerland", "city": null, "Name": "hung ngo"}, {"country": "switzerland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "idsia dalle molle institute for artificial intelligence usi-supsi manno-lugano switzerland", "city": null, "Name": "matthew luciw"}, {"country": "switzerland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "idsia dalle molle institute for artificial intelligence usi-supsi manno-lugano switzerland", "city": null, "Name": "jawas nagi"}, {"country": "switzerland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "idsia dalle molle institute for artificial intelligence usi-supsi manno-lugano switzerland", "city": null, "Name": "alexander forster"}, {"country": "switzerland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "idsia dalle molle institute for artificial intelligence usi-supsi manno-lugano switzerland", "city": null, "Name": "jurgen schmidhuber"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "mlr lab university of stuttgart germany", "city": "stuttgart", "Name": "ngo anh vien"}]}, "Article No.: 12e": {"references": ["Luciana Benotti , Tessa Lau , Mart\u00edn Villalba, Interpreting Natural Language Instructions Using Language, Vision, and Behavior, ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS), v.4 n.3, October 2014[doi>10.1145/2629632]\n", "Heriberto Cuay\u00e1huitl , Ivana Kruijff-Korbayov\u00e1 , Nina Dethlefs, Nonstrict Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Interactive Systems and Robots, ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS), v.4 n.3, October 2014[doi>10.1145/2659003]\n", "Heriberto Cuay\u00e1huitl , Martijn van Otterlo , Nina Dethlefs , Lutz Frommberger, Machine learning for interactive systems and robots: a brief introduction, Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Machine Learning for Interactive Systems: Bridging the Gap Between Perception, Action and Communication, p.19-28, August 04-04, 2013, Beijing, China[doi>10.1145/2493525.2493530]\n", "Anthony Jameson , John Riedl, Introduction to the Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS), v.1 n.1, p.1-6, October 2011[doi>10.1145/2030365.2030366]\n", "Simon Keizer , Mary Ellen Foster , Zhuoran Wang , Oliver Lemon, Machine Learning for Social Multiparty Human--Robot Interaction, ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS), v.4 n.3, October 2014[doi>10.1145/2600021]\n", "Hung Ngo , Matthew Luciw , Jawas Nagi , Alexander Forster , J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber , Ngo Anh Vien, Efficient Interactive Multiclass Learning from Binary Feedback, ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS), v.4 n.3, October 2014[doi>10.1145/2629631]\n", "Kiri Wagstaff. 2012.

Given a natural language instruction, can we automatically predict what an instruction follower, such as a robot, should do in the environment to follow that instruction&quest; Previous approaches to automatic instruction interpretation have required either extensive domain-dependent rule writing or extensive manually annotated corpora. This article presents a novel approach that leverages a large amount of unannotated, easy-to-collect data from humans interacting in a game-like environment. Our approach uses an automatic annotation phase based on artificial intelligence planning, for which two different annotation strategies are compared: one based on behavioral information and the other based on visibility information. The resulting annotations are used as training data for different automatic classifiers. This algorithm is based on the intuition that the problem of interpreting a situated instruction can be cast as a classification problem of choosing among the actions that are possible in the situation. Classification is done by combining language, vision, and behavior information. Our empirical analysis shows that machine learning classifiers achieve 77&percnt; accuracy on this task on available English corpora and 74&percnt; on similar German corpora. Finally, the inclusion of human feedback in the interpretation process is shown to boost performance to 92&percnt; for the English corpus and 90&percnt; for the German corpus.", "authors": [{"name": "luciana benotti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442617808"}, {"name": "tessa lau", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658632725"}, {"name": "martin villalba", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548991756"}], "title": "Interpreting Natural Language Instructions Using Language, Vision, and Behavior", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "37\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "159\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "costa rica", "university": "universidad nacional", "affiliation_string": "universidad nacional de cordoba argentinaconicet argentina", "city": "heredia", "Name": "luciana benotti"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "martin villalba", "city": null, "Name": "tessa lau"}]}}, "date": {"month": "October", "year": "2014"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Robert Amar , James Eagan , John Stasko, Low-Level Components of Analytic Activity in Information Visualization, Proceedings of the Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization, p.15, October 23-25, 2005[doi>10.1109/INFOVIS.2005.24]\n", "D.

However, recent research has indicated that visualization performance could be improved by adapting aspects of the visualization to the individual user. To this end, this article presents research aimed at supporting the design of novel user-adaptive visualization systems. In particular, we discuss results on using information on user eye gaze patterns while interacting with a given visualization to predict properties of the user's visualization task; the user's performance (in terms of predicted task completion time); and the user's individual cognitive abilities, such as perceptual speed, visual working memory, and verbal working memory. We provide a detailed analysis of different eye gaze feature sets, as well as over-time accuracies. We show that these predictions are significantly better than a baseline classifier even during the early stages of visualization usage. These findings are then discussed with a view to designing visualization systems that can adapt to the individual user in real time.", "authors": [{"name": "ben steichen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436602697"}, {"name": "cristina conati", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100274362"}, {"name": "giuseppe carenini", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100417032"}], "title": "Inferring Visualization Task Properties, User Performance, and User Cognitive Abilities from Eye Gaze Data", "citations": [{"Name": "C.

To enable recommender systems to suggest items that are useful to a particular user, it can be essential to understand the user and his or her interactions with the system. These interactions typically manifest themselves as explicit and implicit user feedback that provides the key indicators for modeling users\u2019 preferences for items and essential information for personalizing recommendations. In this article, we propose a classification framework for the use of explicit and implicit user feedback in recommender systems based on a set of distinct properties that include Cognitive Effort, User Model, Scale of Measurement, and Domain Relevance. We develop a set of comparison criteria for explicit and implicit user feedback to emphasize the key properties. Using our framework, we provide a classification of recommender systems that have addressed questions about user feedback, and we review state-of-the-art techniques to improve such user feedback and thereby improve the performance of the recommender system. Finally, we formulate challenges for future research on improvement of user feedback.", "authors": [{"name": "gawesh jawaheer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100551816"}, {"name": "peter weller", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453626797"}, {"name": "patty kostkova", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100628567"}], "title": "Modeling User Preferences in Recommender Systems: A Classification Framework for Explicit and Implicit User Feedback", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "588\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "54\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "1248\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "city university", "affiliation_string": "city university london uk", "city": "london", "Name": "gawesh jawaheer"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "city university", "affiliation_string": "city university london uk", "city": "london", "Name": "peter weller"}, {"country": "Canada", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university college london ucl uk", "city": "london", "Name": "patty kostkova"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["S.

Affect-sensitive robots are more likely to be able to establish and maintain believable interactions over extended periods of time. Nevertheless, the integration of affect recognition frameworks in real-time human-robot interaction scenarios is still underexplored. In this article, we propose and evaluate a context-sensitive affect recognition framework for a robotic game companion for children. The robot can automatically detect affective states experienced by children in an interactive chess game scenario. The affect recognition framework is based on the automatic extraction of task features and social interaction-based features. Vision-based indicators of the children\u2019s nonverbal behaviour are merged with contextual features related to the game and the interaction and given as input to support vector machines to create a context-sensitive multimodal system for affect recognition. The affect recognition framework is fully integrated in an architecture for adaptive human-robot interaction. Experimental evaluation showed that children\u2019s affect can be successfully predicted using a combination of behavioural and contextual data related to the game and the interaction with the robot. It was found that contextual data alone can be used to successfully predict a subset of affective dimensions, such as interest toward the robot. Experiments also showed that engagement with the robot can be predicted using information about the user\u2019s valence, interest and anticipatory behaviour. These results provide evidence that social engagement can be modelled as a state consisting of affect and attention components in the context of the interaction.", "authors": [{"name": "ginevra castellano", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81335488884"}, {"name": "iolanda leite", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367599529"}, {"name": "andre pereira", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367593336"}, {"name": "carlos martinho", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100515442"}, {"name": "ana paiva", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436595004"}, {"name": "peter w mcowan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100583803"}], "title": "Context-Sensitive Affect Recognition for a Robotic Game Companion", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "91\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "171\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of birmingham", "affiliation_string": "university of birmingham united kingdom", "city": "birmingham", "Name": "ginevra castellano"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "yale university new haven ct usa", "city": "new haven", "Name": "iolanda leite"}, {"country": "Portugal", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "inesc-id and instituto superior tecnico technical university of lisbon porto salvo portugal", "city": "lisbon", "Name": "andre pereira"}, {"country": "Portugal", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "inesc-id and instituto superior tecnico technical university of lisbon porto salvo portugal", "city": "lisbon", "Name": "carlos martinho"}, {"country": "Portugal", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "inesc-id and instituto superior tecnico technical university of lisbon porto salvo portugal", "city": "lisbon", "Name": "ana paiva"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of london", "affiliation_string": "queen mary university of london united kingdom", "city": "london", "Name": "peter w mcowan"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["Eytan Adar , Daniel S.

This problem subsumes many interesting personalized web applications such as personalization for buzz query detection, for query expansion, and for query recommendation. These personalized applications can greatly enhance user interaction with web search engines by providing more customized information discovered from user input (i.e., queries), but the LQP task has rarely been investigated in the literature. Although exist abundant work on estimatingglobalweb search trends does exist, it often encounters the big challenge of data sparsity when personalization comes into play.In this article, we tackle the LQP task by proposing a series of collaborative language models (CLMs). CLMs alleviate the data sparsity issue by collaboratively collecting queries and trend information from the other locations. The traditional statistical language models assume a fixed background language model, which loses the taste of personalization. In contrast, CLMs are personalized language models with flexible background language models customized to various locations.

The combined low-level 3D postural features and high-level kinematic and geometrical features are fed to a Random Forests classifier through summarization (statistical values) or aggregation (bag of features). In order to improve the generalization capability and the robustness of the system, a novel semisupervised adaptive algorithm is built on top of the conventional Random Forests classifier. The MoCap UCLIC affective gesture database (labeled with four emotions) was used to train the Random Forests classifier, which led to an overall recognition rate of 78&percnt; using a 10-fold cross-validation. Subsequently, the trained classifier was used in a stream-based semisupervised Adaptive Random Forests method for continuous unlabeled Kinect data classification. The very low update cost of our adaptive classifier makes it highly suitable for data stream applications. Tests performed on the publicly available emotion datasets (body gestures and facial expressions) indicate that our new classifier outperforms existing algorithms for data streams in terms of accuracy and computational costs.", "authors": [{"name": "weiyi wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658657061"}, {"name": "valentin enescu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418593939"}, {"name": "hichem sahli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100062413"}], "title": "Adaptive Real-Time Emotion Recognition from Body Movements", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "185\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "39\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "185\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "belgium", "university": "vrije universiteit brussel", "affiliation_string": "avsp-etro vrije universiteit brussel vub brussels belgium", "city": "brussels", "Name": "weiyi wang"}, {"country": "belgium", "university": "vrije universiteit brussel", "affiliation_string": "avsp-etro vrije universiteit brussel vub brussels belgium", "city": "brussels", "Name": "valentin enescu"}, {"country": "belgium", "university": "vrije universiteit brussel", "affiliation_string": "avsp-etro vrije universiteit brussel vub and interuniversity microelectronics center imec brussels belgium", "city": "brussels", "Name": "hichem sahli"}]}, "Article No.: 22": {"references": ["Michael Argyle and Mark Cook. 1976.

It is well known that gaze behaviors differ depending on participation role: speaker, addressee, or side participant. In this study, we focus on dominance as another factor that affects gaze. First, we conducted an empirical study and analyzed its results that showed how gaze behaviors are affected by both dominance and participation roles. Then, using speech and gaze information that was statistically significant for distinguishing the more dominant and less dominant person in an empirical study, we established a regression-based model for estimating conversational dominance. On the basis of the model, we implemented a dominance estimation mechanism that processes online speech and head direction data. Then we applied our findings to human-robot interaction. To design robot gaze behaviors, we analyzed gaze transitions with respect to participation roles and dominance and implemented gaze-transition models as robot gaze behavior generation rules. Finally, we evaluated a humanoid robot that has dominance estimation functionality and determines its gaze based on the gaze models, and we found that dominant participants had a better impression of less dominant robot gaze behaviors. This suggests that a robot using our gaze models was preferred to a robot that was simply looking at the speaker. We have demonstrated the importance of considering dominance in human-robot multiparty interaction.", "authors": [{"name": "yukiko i nakano", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100627480"}, {"name": "takashi yoshino", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658648904"}, {"name": "misato yatsushiro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84459065057"}, {"name": "yutaka takase", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81485652285"}], "title": "Generating Robot Gaze on the Basis of Participation Roles and Dominance Estimation in Multiparty Interaction", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "51\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "51\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "japan", "university": "seikei university", "affiliation_string": "seikei university tokyo japan", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "yukiko i nakano"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "seikei university", "affiliation_string": "seikei university tokyo japan", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "takashi yoshino"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "seikei university", "affiliation_string": "seikei university tokyo japan", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "misato yatsushiro"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "seikei university", "affiliation_string": "seikei university tokyo japan", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "yutaka takase"}]}, "Article No.: 20": {"references": ["John R.

These approaches provide promising results in terms of recognition performance, coping with the uncertainty of observations, and model size explosion when complex problems are modelled. But experience has shown that it is not always intuitive to model even seemingly simple problems. To date, there are no guidelines for developing such models. To address this problem, in this work we present a development process for building symbolic models that is based on experience acquired so far as well as on existing engineering and data analysis workflows. The proposed process is a first attempt at providing structured guidelines and practices for designing, modelling, and evaluating human behaviour in the form of symbolic models for AR. As an illustration of the process, a simple example from the office domain was developed. The process was evaluated in a comparative study of an intuitive process and the proposed process. The results showed a significant improvement over the intuitive process. Furthermore, the study participants reported greater ease of use and perceived effectiveness when following the proposed process. To evaluate the applicability of the process to more complex AR problems, it was applied to a problem from the kitchen domain. The results showed that following the proposed process yielded an average accuracy of 78&percnt;. The developed model outperformed state-of-the-art methods applied to the same dataset in previous work, and it performed comparably to a symbolic model developed by a model expert without following the proposed development process.", "authors": [{"name": "kristina yordanova", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490680872"}, {"name": "thomas kirste", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100196779"}], "title": "A Process for Systematic Development of Symbolic Models for Activity Recognition", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "111\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "32\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "111\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of rostock rostock germany", "city": "rostock", "Name": "kristina yordanova"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of rostock rostock germany", "city": "rostock", "Name": "thomas kirste"}]}, "Article No.: 21": {"references": ["Maren Bennewitz, Felix Faber, Dominik Joho, Michael Schreiber, and Sven Behnke. 2005.

In one case, when an elderly person requested assistance, the gaze of the care worker communicated that he/she would serve that client next in turn. In the other case, the gaze conveyed a request to the service seeker to wait until the care worker finished attending the current client. Each gaze function depended on the care worker's current engagement and other behaviors. We sought to integrate these findings into the development of a robot that might function more effectively in multiple human-robot party settings. We focused on the multiple functions of gaze and bodily actions, implementing those functions into our robot. We conducted three experiments to gauge a combination of gestures and gazes performed by our robot. This article demonstrates that the employment of gaze is an important consideration when developing robots that can interact effectively in multiple human-robot party settings.", "authors": [{"name": "keiichi yamazaki", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350572857"}, {"name": "akiko yamazaki", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100620449"}, {"name": "keiko ikeda", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81500661373"}, {"name": "chen liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658969155"}, {"name": "mihoko fukushima", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81555625856"}, {"name": "yoshinori kobayashi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100604144"}, {"name": "yoshinori kuno", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100082332"}], "title": "\u201cI\u2019ll Be There Next\u201d: A Multiplex Care Robot System that Conveys Service Order Using Gaze Gestures", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "53\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "17\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "53\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "philippines", "university": "ama university", "affiliation_string": "saitama university saitama japan", "city": "manila", "Name": "keiichi yamazaki"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "tokyo university", "affiliation_string": "tokyo university of technology tokyo japan", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "akiko yamazaki"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "kansai university", "affiliation_string": "kansai university osaka japan", "city": "osaka", "Name": "keiko ikeda"}, {"country": "philippines", "university": "ama university", "affiliation_string": "saitama university saitama japan", "city": "manila", "Name": "chen liu"}, {"country": "Japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of miyazaki miyazaki japan", "city": "miyazaki", "Name": "mihoko fukushima"}, {"country": "philippines", "university": "ama university", "affiliation_string": "saitama university", "city": "manila", "Name": "yoshinori kobayashi"}, {"country": "philippines", "university": "ama university", "affiliation_string": "saitama university saitama japan", "city": "manila", "Name": "yoshinori kuno"}]}}, "date": {"month": "January", "year": "2016"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Sam S.

Some of these methods generate examples that require the learner to generalize appropriately. When procedures are complex, however, it becomes unmanageable to induce the procedures from examples alone. An alternative and very common method for teaching procedures is tutorial instruction, where a teacher describes in general terms what actions to perform and possibly includes explanations of the rationale for the actions. This article provides an overview of the challenges in using human tutorial instruction for teaching procedures to computers. First, procedures can be very complex and can involve many different types of interrelated information, including (1) situating the instruction in the context of relevant objects and their properties, (2) describing the steps involved, (3) specifying the organization of the procedure in terms of relationships among steps and substeps, and (4) conveying control structures. Second, human tutorial instruction is naturally plagued with omissions, oversights, unintentional inconsistencies, errors, and simply poor design. The article presents a survey of work from the literature that highlights the nature of these challenges and illustrates them with numerous examples of instruction in many domains. Major research challenges in this area are highlighted, including the difficulty of the learning task when procedures are complex, the need to overcome omissions and errors in the instruction, the design of a natural user interface to specify procedures, the management of the interaction of a human with a learning system, and the combination of tutorial instruction with other teaching modalities.", "authors": [{"name": "yolanda gil", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100348498"}], "title": "Human Tutorial Instruction in the Raw", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "56\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "58\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Singapore", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of southern california admiralty way marina del rey ca usa", "city": "admiralty", "Name": "yolanda gil"}]}, "Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Y.

Gaze cues in particular are integral in mechanisms for communication and management of attention in social interactions, which can trigger important social and cognitive processes, such as establishment of affiliation between people or learning new information. The fundamental building blocks of gaze behaviors aregaze shifts: coordinated movements of the eyes, head, and body toward objects and information in the environment. In this article, we present a novel computational model for gaze shift synthesis for ECAs that supports parametric control over coordinated eye, head, and upper body movements. We employed the model in three studies with human participants. In the first study, we validated the model by showing that participants are able to interpret the agent\u2019s gaze direction accurately. In the second and third studies, we showed that by adjusting the participation of the head and upper body in gaze shifts, we can control the strength of the attention signals conveyed, thereby strengthening or weakening their social and cognitive effects. The second study shows that manipulation of eye--head coordination in gaze enables an agent to convey more information or establish stronger affiliation with participants in a teaching task, while the third study demonstrates how manipulation of upper body coordination enables the agent to communicate increased interest in objects in the environment.", "authors": [{"name": "tomislav pejsa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384600775"}, {"name": "sean andrist", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81481650937"}, {"name": "michael gleicher", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100342764"}, {"name": "bilge mutlu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310500023"}], "title": "Gaze and Attention Management for Embodied Conversational Agents", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "140\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "147\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wisconsin-madison department of computer sciences w dayton st madison wi", "city": "madison", "Name": "tomislav pejsa"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wisconsin-madison department of computer sciences w dayton st madison wi", "city": "madison", "Name": "sean andrist"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wisconsin-madison department of computer sciences w dayton st madison wi", "city": "madison", "Name": "michael gleicher"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wisconsin-madison department of computer sciences w dayton st madison wi", "city": "madison", "Name": "bilge mutlu"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["Mohammed Al-Rousan, Omar Al-Jarrah, and Mohammed Al-Hammouri. 2010.

Specifically, our work develops and evaluates three strategies for incorporating context into 3D gesture recognizers. These strategies include modifying the well-known Rubine linear classifier to handle unsegmented input streams and per-frame retraining using contextual information (CA-Linear); a GPU implementation of dynamic time warping (DTW) that reduces the overhead of traditional DTW by utilizing context to evaluate only relevant time sequences inside of a multithreaded kernel (CA-DTW); and a multiclass SVM with per-class probability estimation that is combined with a contextually based prior probability distribution (CA-SVM).We evaluate each strategy using a Kinect-based third-person perspective VE game prototype that combines parkour-style navigation with hand-to-hand combat. Using a simple gesture collection application to collect a set of 57 gestures and the game prototype that implements 37 of these gestures, we conduct three experiments. In the first experiment, we evaluate the effectiveness of several established classifiers on our gesture set and demonstrate state-of-the-art results using our proposed method. In our second experiment, we generate 500 random scenarios having between 5 and 19 of the 57 gestures in context. We show that the contextually aware classifiers CA-Linear, CA-DTW, and CA-SVM significantly outperform their non--contextually aware counterparts by 37.74&percnt;, 36.04&percnt;, and 20.81&percnt;, respectively. On the basis of the results of the second experiment, we derive upper-bound expectations for in-game performance for the three CA classifiers: 96.61&percnt;, 86.79&percnt;, and 96.86&percnt;, respectively. Finally, our third experiment is an in-game evaluation of the three CA classifiers with and without context. Our results show that through the use of context, we are able to achieve an average in-game recognition accuracy of 89.67&percnt; with CA-Linear compared to 65.10&percnt; without context, 79.04&percnt; for CA-DTW compared to 58.1&percnt; without context, and 90.85&percnt; with CA-SVM compared to 75.2&percnt; without context.", "authors": [{"name": "eugene m taranta ii", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=89558635157"}, {"name": "thaddeus k simons", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658694872"}, {"name": "rahul sukthankar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100139048"}, {"name": "joseph j laviola jr", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100283513"}], "title": "Exploring the Benefits of Context in 3D Gesture Recognition for Game-Based Virtual Environments", "citations": [{"Name": "Joseph J.

The contributions are (1) a new three-dimensional resonance-arousal-valence model for the representation of emotion expressed in music, together with methods for automatically classifying a piece of music in terms of this model, using robust regression methods applied to musical/acoustic features; (2) methods for predicting a listener\u2019s emotional state on the assumption that the emotional state has been determined entirely by a sequence of pieces of music recently listened to, using conditional random fields and taking into account the decay of emotion intensity over time; and (3) a method for selecting a ranked list of pieces of music that match a particular emotional state, using a minimization iteration method. A series of experiments yield information about the validity of our operationalizations of these contributions. Throughout the article, we refer to an illustrative usage scenario in which all of these contributions can be exploited, where it is assumed that (1) a listener\u2019s emotional state is being determined entirely by the music that he or she has been listening to and (2) the listener wants to hear additional music that matches his or her current emotional state. The contributions are intended to be useful in a variety of other scenarios as well.", "authors": [{"name": "james j deng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658693472"}, {"name": "clement h c leung", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81322499716"}, {"name": "alfredo milani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100179087"}, {"name": "li chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323488898"}], "title": "Emotional States Associated with Music: Classification, Prediction of Changes, and Consideration in Recommendation", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "246\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "13\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "259\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "hong kong", "university": "hong kong baptist university", "affiliation_string": "hong kong baptist university hong kong", "city": "jiulong", "Name": "james j deng"}, {"country": "hong kong", "university": "hong kong baptist university", "affiliation_string": "hong kong baptist university hong kong", "city": "jiulong", "Name": "clement h c leung"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of perugia", "affiliation_string": "university of perugia italy", "city": "perugia", "Name": "alfredo milani"}, {"country": "hong kong", "university": "hong kong baptist university", "affiliation_string": "hong kong baptist university hong kong", "city": "jiulong", "Name": "li chen"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Hande Alemdar , Cem Ersoy, Wireless sensor networks for healthcare: A survey, Computer Networks: The International Journal of Computer and Telecommunications Networking, v.54 n.15, p.2688-2710, October, 2010[doi>10.1016/j.comnet.2010.05.003]\n", "N.

Commonly, short periods of motor blocks occur during walking, known as freezing of gait (FoG). To slow the progressive decline of motor abilities, people with PD usually undertake stationary motor-training exercises in the clinics or supervised by physiotherapists. We present a wearable system for the support of people with PD and FoG. The system is designed for independent use. It enables motor training and gait assistance at home and other unsupervised environments. The system consists of three components. First, FoG episodes are detected in real time using wearable inertial sensors and a smartphone as the processing unit. Second, a feedback mechanism triggers a rhythmic auditory signal to the user to alleviate freeze episodes in an assistive mode. Third, the smartphone-based application features support for training exercises. Moreover, the system allows unobtrusive and long-term monitoring of the user\u2019s clinical condition by transmitting sensing data and statistics to a telemedicine service.We investigate the at-home acceptance of the wearable system in a study with nine PD subjects. Participants deployed and used the system on their own, without any clinical support, at their homes during three protocol sessions in 1 week. Users\u2019 feedback suggests an overall positive attitude toward adopting and using the system in their daily life, indicating that the system supports them in improving their gait. Further, in a data-driven analysis with sensing data from five participants, we study whether there is an observable effect on the gait during use of the system. In three out of five subjects, we observed a decrease in FoG duration distributions over the protocol days during gait-training exercises. Moreover, sensing data-driven analysis shows a decrease in FoG duration and FoG number in four out of five participants when they use the system as a gait-assistive tool during normal daily life activities at home.", "authors": [{"name": "sinziana mazilu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81492655739"}, {"name": "ulf blanke", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436603027"}, {"name": "moran dorfman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658693401"}, {"name": "eran gazit", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81555726456"}, {"name": "anat mirelman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658693378"}, {"name": "jeffrey m hausdorff", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81444608333"}, {"name": "gerhard troster", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100164451"}], "title": "A Wearable Assistant for Gait Training for Parkinson\u2019s Disease with Freezing of Gait in Out-of-the-Lab Environments", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "259\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "19\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "306\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Switzerland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "wearable computing laboratory eth zurich switzerland", "city": "zurich", "Name": "sinziana mazilu"}, {"country": "Switzerland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "wearable computing laboratory eth zurich switzerland", "city": "zurich", "Name": "ulf blanke"}, {"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "laboratory of gait and neurodynamics tel aviv sourasky medical center israel", "city": "tel aviv", "Name": "moran dorfman"}, {"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "laboratory of gait and neurodynamics tel aviv sourasky medical center israel", "city": "tel aviv", "Name": "eran gazit"}, {"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "laboratory of gait and neurodynamics tel aviv sourasky medical center israel", "city": "tel aviv", "Name": "anat mirelman"}, {"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "laboratory of gait and neurodynamics tel aviv sourasky medical center israel", "city": "tel aviv", "Name": "jeffrey m hausdorff"}, {"country": "Switzerland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "wearable computing laboratory eth zurich switzerland", "city": "zurich", "Name": "gerhard troster"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 15": {"references": ["Christine Alvarado , Randall Davis, SketchREAD: a multi-domain sketch recognition engine, Proceedings of the 17th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology, October 24-27, 2004, Santa Fe, NM, USA[doi>10.1145/1029632.1029637]\n", "Lisa Anthony. 2008.

However, designing and building an accurate and sophisticated sketch recognition system is a time-consuming and daunting task. Since sketch recognition mistakes are still common, it is important to understand how users perceive and tolerate recognition errors and other user interface elements with these imperfect systems. In order to solve this problem, we developed a Wizard of Oz sketch recognition tool, the WOZ Recognizer, that supports controlled recognition accuracy, multiple recognition modes, and multiple sketching domains for performing controlled experiments. We present the design of the WOZ Recognizer and our process for representing recognition domains using graphs and symbol alphabets. In addition, we discuss how sketches are altered, how to control the WOZ Recognizer, and how users interact with it. Finally, we present an expert user case study that examines the WOZ Recognizer\u2019s usability.", "authors": [{"name": "jared n bott", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435603205"}, {"name": "joseph j laviola jr", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100283513"}], "title": "The WOZ Recognizer: A Wizard of Oz Sketch Recognition System", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "45\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "45\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Mongolia", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of central florida orlando fl", "city": "central", "Name": "jared n bott"}, {"country": "Mongolia", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of central florida orlando fl", "city": "central", "Name": "joseph j laviola jr"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Nadav Aharony , Wei Pan , Cory Ip , Inas Khayal , Alex Pentland, Social fMRI: Investigating and shaping social mechanisms in the real world, Pervasive and Mobile Computing, v.7 n.6, p.643-659, December, 2011[doi>10.1016/j.pmcj.2011.09.004]\n", "Louis Atallah , Guang-Zhong Yang, Review: The use of pervasive sensing for behaviour profiling - a survey, Pervasive and Mobile Computing, v.5 n.5, p.447-464, October, 2009[doi>10.1016/j.pmcj.2009.06.009]\n", "Davide Anguita , Alessandro Ghio , Luca Oneto , Xavier Parra , Jorge L.

Movement qualities convey information revealing movement expressiveness; their use has strong potential for movement-based interaction with applications in arts, entertainment, education, or rehabilitation. The purpose of our research is to design and evaluate interactive reflexive visuals for movement qualities. The theoretical basis for this research is drawn from a collaboration with the members of the international dance company Emio Greco&verbar;PC to study their formalization of movement qualities. We designed a pedagogical interactive installation calledDouble Skin/Double Mind (DS/DM)for the analysis and visualization of movement qualities through physical model-based interactive renderings.In this article, we first evaluate dancers\u2019 perception of the visuals as metaphors for movement qualities. This evaluation shows that, depending on the physical model parameterization, the visuals are capable of generating dynamic behaviors that the dancers associate withDS/DMmovement qualities. Moreover, we evaluate dance students\u2019 and professionals\u2019 experience of the interactive visuals in the context of a dance pedagogical workshop and a professional dance training. The results of these evaluations show that the dancers consider the interactive visuals to be a reflexive system that encourages them to perform, improves their experience, and contributes to a better understanding of movement qualities. Our findings support research on interactive systems for real-time analysis and visualization of movement qualities, which open new perspectives in movement-based interaction design.", "authors": [{"name": "sarah fdili alaoui", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81503669684"}, {"name": "frederic bevilacqua", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100077889"}, {"name": "christian jacquemin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100639064"}], "title": "Interactive Visuals as Metaphors for Dance Movement Qualities", "citations": [{"Name": "Jeroen Peeters ", "Country": "netherlands", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ambra Trotto ", "Country": "netherlands", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Stoffel Kuenen", "Country": "netherlands", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "MoCap Tango: Traces of Complexity", "Country": "netherlands", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "85\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "85\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "canada", "university": "simon fraser university", "affiliation_string": "school of interactive arts and technologies simon fraser university vancouver canada", "city": "burnaby", "Name": "sarah fdili alaoui"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "sciences et technologies de la musique et du son stms ircam - cnrs - upmc paris", "city": null, "Name": "frederic bevilacqua"}, {"country": "france", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university paris-sud and limsi-cnrs orsay france", "city": null, "Name": "christian jacquemin"}]}, "Article No.: 16": {"references": ["Richard Arias-Hernandez , Linda T.

These interactive methods are used for solving optimization problems. The interaction with an end user or decision maker aims at improving the efficiency of the optimization procedure, enriching the optimization model, or informing the user regarding the solutions proposed by the optimization system. First, we present the challenges of using optimization methods as a tool for supporting decision making, and we justify the integration of the user in the optimization process. This integration is generally achieved via a dynamic interaction between the user and the system. Next, the different classes of interactive optimization approaches are presented. This detailed review includes trial and error, interactive reoptimization, interactive multiobjective optimization, interactive evolutionary algorithms, human-guided search, and other approaches that are less well covered in the research literature. On the basis of this review, we propose a classification that aims to better describe and compare interaction mechanisms. This classification offers two complementary views on interactive optimization methods. The first perspective focuses on the user\u2019s contribution to the optimization process, and the second concerns the components of interactive optimization systems. Finally, on the basis of this review and classification, we identify some open issues and potential perspectives for interactive optimization methods.", "authors": [{"name": "david meignan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81438597921"}, {"name": "sigrid knust", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100363677"}, {"name": "jean-marc frayret", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100396279"}, {"name": "gilles pesant", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81343502516"}, {"name": "nicolas gaud", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81385598570"}], "title": "A Review and Taxonomy of Interactive Optimization Methods in Operations Research", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "147\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "20\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "147\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "germany", "university": "universitat osnabruck", "affiliation_string": "universitat osnabruck osnabruck deutschland", "city": "osnabruck", "Name": "david meignan"}, {"country": "germany", "university": "universitat osnabruck", "affiliation_string": "universitat osnabruck osnabruck deutschland", "city": "osnabruck", "Name": "sigrid knust"}, {"country": "france", "university": "ecole polytechnique", "affiliation_string": "ecole polytechnique de montreal montreal canada", "city": "palaiseau", "Name": "jean-marc frayret"}, {"country": "france", "university": "ecole polytechnique", "affiliation_string": "ecole polytechnique de montreal montreal canada", "city": "palaiseau", "Name": "gilles pesant"}, {"country": "France", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universite de technologie de belfort-monteliard belfort france", "city": "belfort", "Name": "nicolas gaud"}]}}, "date": {"month": "October", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 8": {"references": ["D.

There is little to no dispute about this belief: Regardless of the artwork, genre, time, and origin of creation, people from different backgrounds are able to read the emotional messages. This holds true even for the most abstract paintings. Could this idea be applied to machines as well? Can machines learn what makes a work of art \u201cemotional\u201d? In this work, we employ a state-of-the-art recognition system to learn which statistical patterns are associated with positive and negative emotions on two different datasets that comprise professional and amateur abstract artworks. Moreover, we analyze and compare two different annotation methods in order to establish the ground truth of positive and negative emotions in abstract art. Additionally, we use computer vision techniques to quantify which parts of a painting evoke positive and negative emotions. We also demonstrate how the quantification of evidence for positive and negative emotions can be used to predict which parts of a painting people prefer to focus on. This method opens new opportunities of research on why a specific painting is perceived as emotional at global and local scales.", "authors": [{"name": "andreza sartori", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548383156"}, {"name": "victoria yanulevskaya", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490690102"}, {"name": "almila akdag salah", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81458649159"}, {"name": "jasper uijlings", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81485640565"}, {"name": "elia bruni", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81496687697"}, {"name": "nicu sebe", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100502198"}], "title": "Affective Analysis of Professional and Amateur Abstract Paintings Using Statistical Analysis and Art Theory", "citations": [{"Name": "Andreza Sartori ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dubravko Culibrk ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yan Yan ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nicu Sebe", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andreza Sartori ", "Country": "argentina", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yan Yan ", "Country": "argentina", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "G\u00f6zde \u00d6zbal ", "Country": "argentina", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alkim Almila Akda\u011f Salah ", "Country": "argentina", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Albert Ali Salah ", "Country": "argentina", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nicu Sebe", "Country": "argentina", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "147\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "14\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "147\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "italy", "university": "university of trento", "affiliation_string": "disi university of trento italy  telecom italia - skil trento italy", "city": "trento", "Name": "andreza sartori"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of trento", "affiliation_string": "disi university of trento italy", "city": "trento", "Name": "victoria yanulevskaya"}, {"country": "netherlands", "university": "university of amsterdam", "affiliation_string": "university of amsterdam the netherlands", "city": "amsterdam", "Name": "almila akdag salah"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of edinburgh", "affiliation_string": "calvin group university of edinburgh united kingdom", "city": "edinburgh", "Name": "jasper uijlings"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "free university of bozen", "affiliation_string": "free university of bozen bolzano italy", "city": "bolzano", "Name": "elia bruni"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of trento", "affiliation_string": "disi university of trento italy", "city": "trento", "Name": "nicu sebe"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Dragomir Anguelov , Carole Dulong , Daniel Filip , Christian Frueh , St\u00e9phane Lafon , Richard Lyon , Abhijit Ogale , Luc Vincent , Josh Weaver, Google Street View: Capturing the World at Street Level, Computer, v.43 n.6, p.32-38, June 2010[doi>10.1109/MC.2010.170]\n", "Jan Anlauff , Tobias Gro\u00dfhauser , Thomas Hermann, tacTiles: a low-cost modular tactile sensing system for floor interactions, Proceedings of the 6th Nordic Conference on Human-Computer Interaction: Extending Boundaries, October 16-20, 2010, Reykjavik, Iceland[doi>10.1145/1868914.1868981]\n", "M.

Through the combination of individual user videos to form a digital crowd, strangers are connected through the graphic display. Our work is inspired by the way distant people can interact with each other through technology and influenced by artists working in the realm of interactive art. We deployed VideoMob in a variety of settings, locations, and contexts to observe hundreds of visitors\u2019 reactions. By analyzing behavioral data collected through depth cameras from our 1,068 recordings across eight venues, we studied how participants behave when given the opportunity to record their own video portrait into the artwork. We report the specific activity performed in front of the camera and the influences that existing crowds impose on new participants. Our analysis informs the integration of a series of possible novel interaction paradigms based on real-time analysis of the visitors\u2019 behavior through specific computer vision and machine learning techniques that have the potential to increase the engagement of the artwork's visitors and to impact user experience.", "authors": [{"name": "emily grenader", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81556687156"}, {"name": "danilo gasques rodrigues", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658732356"}, {"name": "fernando nos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81556532956"}, {"name": "nadir weibel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100240198"}], "title": "The VideoMob Interactive Art Installation Connecting Strangers through Inclusive Digital Crowds", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "103\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "21\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "103\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Mali", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california san diego la jolla ca", "city": "san", "Name": "emily grenader"}, {"country": "brazil", "university": "universidade federal de sao carlos", "affiliation_string": "universidade federal de sao carlos brazil", "city": "sao carlos", "Name": "danilo gasques rodrigues"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "nadir weibel", "city": null, "Name": "fernando nos"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "danilo gasques rodrigues", "city": null, "Name": "university of california san diego la jolla ca"}]}, "Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Keith Anderson , Elisabeth Andr\u00e9 , T.

This view takes on new relevance given the emergence of conversational social video as a popular genre among viewers looking for entertainment and among video contributors as a channel for debate, expertise sharing, and artistic expression. From the perspective of human behavior understanding, in conversational social video both verbal and nonverbal information is conveyed by speakers and decoded by viewers. We present a systematic study of classification and ranking of mood impressions in social video, using vlogs from YouTube. Our approach considers eleven natural mood categories labeled through crowdsourcing by external observers on a diverse set of conversational vlogs. We extract a comprehensive number of nonverbal and verbal behavioral cues from the audio and video channels to characterize the mood of vloggers. Then we implement and validate vlog classification and vlog ranking tasks using supervised learning methods. Following a reliability and correlation analysis of the mood impression data, our study demonstrates that, while the problem is challenging, several mood categories can be inferred with promising performance. Furthermore, multimodal features perform consistently better than single-channel features. Finally, we show that addressing mood as a ranking problem is a promising practical direction for several of the mood categories studied.", "authors": [{"name": "dairazalia sanchez-cortes", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81447601944"}, {"name": "shiro kumano", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81416595109"}, {"name": "kazuhiro otsuka", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100500908"}, {"name": "daniel gatica-perez", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100273781"}], "title": "In the Mood for Vlog: Multimodal Inference in Conversational Social Video", "citations": [{"Name": "Gilberto Ch\u00e1vez-Mart\u00ednez ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Salvador Ruiz-Correa ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daniel Gatica-Perez", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "100\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "15\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "100\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "switzerland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "idiap research institute martigny switzerland", "city": null, "Name": "dairazalia sanchez-cortes"}, {"country": "japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ntt communication science laboratories atsugi-shi japan", "city": null, "Name": "shiro kumano"}, {"country": "japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ntt communication science laboratories atsugi-shi japan", "city": null, "Name": "kazuhiro otsuka"}, {"country": "france", "university": "ecole polytechnique", "affiliation_string": "idiap research institute and ecole polytechnique federale de lausanne epfl martigny switzerland", "city": "palaiseau", "Name": "daniel gatica-perez"}]}}, "date": {"month": "July", "year": "2015"}}}, "Volume2": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Article No.: 22": {"references": ["Alibali, M.

Over the last five years, our research has focused on using the multimodal interaction paradigm to detect fluctuations in cognitive load in user behavior during system interaction. Cognitive load variations have been found to impact interactive behavior: by monitoring variations in specific modal input features executed in tasks of varying complexity, we gain an understanding of the communicative changes that occur when cognitive load is high. So far, we have identified specific changes in: speech, namely acoustic, prosodic, and linguistic changes; interactive gesture; and digital pen input, both interactive and freeform. As ground-truth measurements, galvanic skin response, subjective, and performance ratings have been used to verify task complexity.The data suggest that it is feasible to use features extracted from behavioral changes in multiple modal inputs as indices of cognitive load. The speech-based indicators of load, based on data collected from user studies in a variety of domains, have shown considerable promise. Scenarios include single-user and team-based tasks; think-aloud and interactive speech; and single-word, reading, and conversational speech, among others. Pen-based cognitive load indices have also been tested with some success, specifically with pen-gesture, handwriting, and freeform pen input, including diagraming. After examining some of the properties of these measurements, we present a multimodal fusion model, which is illustrated with quantitative examples from a case study.The feasibility of employing user input and behavior patterns as indices of cognitive load is supported by experimental evidence. Moreover, symptomatic cues of cognitive load derived from user behavior such as acoustic speech signals, transcribed text, digital pen trajectories of handwriting, and shapes pen, can be supported by well-established theoretical frameworks, including O'Donnell and Eggemeier's workload measurement [1986] Sweller's Cognitive Load Theory [Chandler and Sweller 1991], and Baddeley's model of modal working memory [1992] as well as McKinstry et al.'s [2008] and Rosenbaum's [2005] action dynamics work. The benefit of using this approach to determine the user's cognitive load in real time is that the data can be collected implicitly that is, during day-to-day use of intelligent interactive systems, thus overcomes problems of intrusiveness and increases applicability in real-world environments, while adapting information selection and presentation in a dynamic computer interface with reference to load.", "authors": [{"name": "fang chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81551981256"}, {"name": "natalie ruiz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81341496177"}, {"name": "eric choi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81552508056"}, {"name": "julien epps", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339498387"}, {"name": "m asif khawaja", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81342500019"}, {"name": "ronnie taib", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309495249"}, {"name": "bo yin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81540358056"}, {"name": "yang wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81551612156"}], "title": "Multimodal behavior and interaction as indicators of cognitive load", "citations": [{"Name": "Syed Arshad ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yang Wang ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fang Chen", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Analysing mouse activity for cognitive load detection", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Davide Maria Calandra ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Antonio Caso ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Francesco Cutugno ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Antonio Origlia ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Silvia Rossi", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Matthew Turk", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "143\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "14\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "705\n", "Citation Count": "6\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "australia", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "nicta australia", "city": null, "Name": "fang chen"}, {"country": "australia", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "nicta australia", "city": null, "Name": "natalie ruiz"}, {"country": "australia", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "nicta australia", "city": null, "Name": "eric choi"}, {"country": "australia", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "nicta australia", "city": null, "Name": "julien epps"}, {"country": "australia", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "nicta australia", "city": null, "Name": "m asif khawaja"}, {"country": "australia", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "nicta australia", "city": null, "Name": "ronnie taib"}, {"country": "australia", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "nicta australia", "city": null, "Name": "bo yin"}, {"country": "australia", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "nicta australia", "city": null, "Name": "yang wang"}]}, "Article No.: 19": {"references": ["Anthony Jameson , John Riedl, Introduction to the Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS), v.1 n.1, p.1-6, October 2011[doi>10.1145/2030365.2030366]\n"], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2395123.2395124", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "This editorial introduction explains the motivation and origin of the TiiS special issue on Highlights of the Decade in Interactive Intelligent Systems and shows how its five articles exemplify the types of research contribution that TiiS aims to encourage and publish.", "authors": [{"name": "anthony jameson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100202818"}, {"name": "john riedl", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100096968"}], "title": "Introduction to the special issue on highlights of the decade in interactive intelligent systems", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "16\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "210\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "german research center for artificial intelligence dfki", "city": null, "Name": "anthony jameson"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of minnesota", "city": null, "Name": "john riedl"}]}, "Article No.: 23": {"references": ["Afzal, S. and Robinson, P. 2011.

AutoTutor is an intelligent tutoring system that helps students compose explanations of difficult concepts in Newtonian physics and enhances computer literacy and critical thinking by interacting with them in natural language with adaptive dialog moves similar to those of human tutors. AutoTutor constructs a cognitive model of students' knowledge levels by analyzing the text of their typed or spoken responses to its questions. The model is used to dynamically tailor the interaction toward individual students' zones of proximal development. Affective AutoTutor takes the individualized instruction and human-like interactivity to a new level by automatically detecting and responding to students' emotional states in addition to their cognitive states. Over 20 controlled experiments comparing AutoTutor with ecological and experimental controls such reading a textbook have consistently yielded learning improvements of approximately one letter grade after brief 30--60-minute interactions. Furthermore, Affective AutoTutor shows even more dramatic improvements in learning than the original AutoTutor system, particularly for struggling students with low domain knowledge. In addition to providing a detailed description of the implementation and evaluation of AutoTutor and Affective AutoTutor, we also discuss new and exciting technologies motivated by AutoTutor such as AutoTutor-Lite, Operation ARIES, GuruTutor, DeepTutor, MetaTutor, and AutoMentor. We conclude this article with our vision for future work on interactive and engaging intelligent tutoring systems.", "authors": [{"name": "sidney dmello", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350567903"}, {"name": "art graesser", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100112113"}], "title": "AutoTutor and affective autotutor: Learning by talking with cognitively and emotionally intelligent computers that talk back", "citations": [{"Name": "Timothy J.

It is estimated that the number of persons with Alzheimer's disease, for example, will top 100 million worldwide by the year 2050 [Alzheimer's Disease International 2009]. It will become harder and harder to provide needed health services to this population of older adults. Further, patients are becoming more aware and involved in their own healthcare decisions. This is creating a void in which technology has an increasingly important role to play as a tool to connect providers with recipients. Examples of interactive technologies range from telecare for remote regions to computer games promoting fitness in the home. Currently, such technologies are developed for specific applications and are difficult to modify to suit individual user needs. The future potential economic and social impact of technology in the healthcare field therefore lies in our ability to make intelligent devices that are customizable by healthcare professionals and their clients, that are adaptive to users over time, and that generalize across tasks and environments.A wide application area for technology in healthcare is for assistance and monitoring in the home. As the population ages, it becomes increasingly dependent on chronic healthcare, such as assistance for tasks of everyday life (washing, cooking, dressing), medication taking, nutrition, and fitness. This article will present a summary of work over the past decade on the development of intelligent systems that provide assistance to persons with cognitive disabilities. These systems are unique in that they are all built using a common framework, a decision-theoretic model for general-purpose assistance in the home. In this article, we will show how this type of general model can be applied to a range of assistance tasks, including prompting for activities of daily living, assistance for art therapists, and stroke rehabilitation. This model is a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that can be customized by end-users, that can integrate complex sensor information, and that can adapt over time. These three characteristics of the POMDP model will allow for increasing uptake and long-term efficiency and robustness of technology for assistance.", "authors": [{"name": "jesse hoey", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339505018"}, {"name": "craig boutilier", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100049948"}, {"name": "pascal poupart", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100464266"}, {"name": "patrick olivier", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100295667"}, {"name": "andrew monk", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100473970"}, {"name": "alex mihailidis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384607433"}], "title": "People, sensors, decisions: Customizable and adaptive technologies for assistance in healthcare", "citations": [{"Name": "Pete Sawyer ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alistair Sutcliffe ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Paul Rayson ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chris Bull", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Thomas Dodson ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nicholas Mattei ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Joshua T.

The personalization in these systems is driven by information about the user, auser model. Moreover, as computers become both ubiquitous and pervasive, personalization operates across the many devices and information stores that constitute the user's personal digital ecosystem. This enables personalization, and the user models driving it, to play an increasing role in people's everyday lives. This makes it critical to establish ways to address key problems of personalization related toprivacy,invisibilityof personalization,errors in user models,wasted user models, and the broad issue of enabling people tocontroltheir user models and associated personalization. We offerscrutable user modelsas a foundation for tackling these problems.This article argues the importance of scrutable user modeling and personalization, illustrating key elements in case studies from our work. We then identify the broad roles for scrutable user models. The article describes how to tackle the technical and interface challenges of designing and building scrutable user modeling systems, presenting design principles and showing how they were established over our twenty years of work on the Personis software framework. Our contributions are the set of principles for scrutable personalization linked to our experience from creating and evaluating frameworks and associated applications built upon them. These constitute a general approach to tackling problems of personalization by enabling users to scrutinize their user models as a basis for understanding and controlling personalization.", "authors": [{"name": "judy kay", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100544712"}, {"name": "bob kummerfeld", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100142265"}], "title": "Creating personalized systems that people can scrutinize and control: Drivers, principles and experience", "citations": [{"Name": "Elizabeth F.

Physiological signals such as the electroencephalogram (EEG) and peripheral physiological signals have been less considered for emotion recognition in comparison to other modalities such as facial expression and speech, although they have a potential interest as alternative or supplementary channels. This article presents our work on: (1) constructing a dataset containing EEG and peripheral physiological signals acquired during presentation of music video clips, which is made publicly available, and (2) conducting binary classification of induced positive/negative valence, high/low arousal, and like/dislike by using the aforementioned signals. The procedure for the dataset acquisition, including stimuli selection, signal acquisition, self-assessment, and signal processing is described in detail. Especially, we propose a novel asymmetry index based on relative wavelet entropy for measuring the asymmetry in the energy distribution of EEG signals, which is used for EEG feature extraction. Then, the classification systems based on EEG and peripheral physiological signals are presented. Single-trial and single-run classification results indicate that, on average, the performance of the EEG-based classification outperforms that of the peripheral physiological signals. However, the peripheral physiological signals can be considered as a good alternative to EEG signals in the case of assessing a user's preference for a given music video clip (like/dislike) since they have a comparable performance to EEG signals while being more easily measured.", "authors": [{"name": "ashkan yazdani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81444606911"}, {"name": "jong-seok lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81444603502"}, {"name": "jean-marc vesin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100545039"}, {"name": "touradj ebrahimi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100284035"}], "title": "Affect recognition based on physiological changes during the watching of music videos", "citations": [{"Name": "Takumi Shirokura ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nagisa Munekata ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tetsuo Ono", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alessandro L.

Whereas some robots use faces to display (simplified) emotional expressions, for other robots such as Nao, body language is the best medium available given their inability to convey facial expressions. Displaying emotional body language that can be interpreted whilst interacting with the robot should significantly improve naturalness. This research investigates the creation of an affect space for the generation of emotional body language to be displayed by humanoid robots. To do so, three experiments investigating how emotional body language displayed by agents is interpreted were conducted. The first experiment compared the interpretation of emotional body language displayed by humans and agents. The results showed that emotional body language displayed by an agent or a human is interpreted in a similar way in terms of recognition. Following these results, emotional key poses were extracted from an actor's performances and implemented in a Nao robot. The interpretation of these key poses was validated in a second study where it was found that participants were better than chance at interpreting the key poses displayed. Finally, an affect space was generated by blending key poses and validated in a third study. Overall, these experiments confirmed that body language is an appropriate medium for robots to display emotions and suggest that an affect space for body expressions can be used to improve the expressiveness of humanoid robots.", "authors": [{"name": "aryel beck", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81472650099"}, {"name": "brett stevens", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81542293456"}, {"name": "kim a bard", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442615628"}, {"name": "lola canamero", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100320029"}], "title": "Emotional body language displayed by artificial agents", "citations": [{"Name": "Yang Xiao ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zhijun Zhang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Aryel Beck ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Junsong Yuan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daniel Thalmann", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Human: Robot interaction by understanding upper body gestures", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yang Xiao ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zhijun Zhang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Aryel Beck ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Junsong Yuan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daniel Thalmann", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Human-robot interaction by understanding upper body gestures", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Junchao Xu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Joost Broekens ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Koen Hindriks ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mark A.

We present a new approach to gesture recognition that attends to both body and hands, and interprets gestures continuously from an unsegmented and unbounded input stream. This article describes the whole procedure of continuous body and hand gesture recognition, from the signal acquisition to processing, to the interpretation of the processed signals.Our system takes a vision-based approach, tracking body and hands using a single stereo camera. Body postures are reconstructed in 3D space using a generative model-based approach with a particle filter, combining both static and dynamic attributes of motion as the input feature to make tracking robust to self-occlusion. The reconstructed body postures guide searching for hands. Hand shapes are classified into one of several canonical hand shapes using an appearance-based approach with a multiclass support vector machine. Finally, the extracted body and hand features are combined and used as the input feature for gesture recognition. We consider our task as an online sequence labeling and segmentation problem. A latent-dynamic conditional random field is used with a temporal sliding window to perform the task continuously. We augment this with a novel technique called multilayered filtering, which performs filtering both on the input layer and the prediction layer. Filtering on the input layer allows capturing long-range temporal dependencies and reducing input signal noise; filtering on the prediction layer allows taking weighted votes of multiple overlapping prediction results as well as reducing estimation noise.We tested our system in a scenario of real-world gestural interaction using the NATOPS dataset, an official vocabulary of aircraft handling gestures. Our experimental results show that: (1) the use of both static and dynamic attributes of motion in body tracking allows statistically significant improvement of the recognition performance over using static attributes of motion alone; and (2) the multilayered filtering statistically significantly improves recognition performance over the nonfiltering method. We also show that, on a set of twenty-four NATOPS gestures, our system achieves a recognition accuracy of 75.37&percnt;.", "authors": [{"name": "yale song", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81500657518"}, {"name": "david demirdjian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100236659"}, {"name": "randall davis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100602780"}], "title": "Continuous body and hand gesture recognition for natural human-computer interaction", "citations": [{"Name": "Andrew Gardner ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Christian A.

The caregiver can choose to either calm the robot down by providing it with comfort, or to leave the robot coping with the situation on its own. When the arousal of the robot has decreased, the robot moves on to further explore the play mat. We gathered results from two experiments using this arousal-driven control architecture. In the first setting, we show that such a robotic architecture allows the human caregiver to influence greatly the learning outcomes of the exploration episode, with some similarities to a primary caregiver during early childhood. In a second experiment, we tested how human adults behaved in a similar setup with two different robots: one \u201cneedy\u201d, often demanding attention, and one more independent, requesting far less care or assistance. Our results show that human adults recognise each profile of the robot for what they have been designed, and behave accordingly to what would be expected, caring more for the needy robot than for the other. Additionally, the subjects exhibited a preference and more positive affect whilst interacting and rating the robot we designed as needy. This experiment leads us to the conclusion that our architecture and setup succeeded in eliciting positive and caregiving behavior from adults of different age groups and technological background. Finally, the consistency and reactivity of the robot during this dyadic interaction appeared crucial for the enjoyment and engagement of the human partner.", "authors": [{"name": "antoine hiolle", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384610800"}, {"name": "lola canamero", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100320029"}, {"name": "marina davila-ross", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81500664153"}, {"name": "kim a bard", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442615628"}], "title": "Eliciting caregiving behavior in dyadic human-robot attachment-like interactions", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "40\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "246\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of hertfordshire", "affiliation_string": "university of hertfordshire uk", "city": "hatfield", "Name": "antoine hiolle"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of hertfordshire", "affiliation_string": "university of hertfordshire uk", "city": "hatfield", "Name": "lola canamero"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of portsmouth", "affiliation_string": "university of portsmouth uk", "city": "portsmouth", "Name": "marina davila-ross"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of portsmouth", "affiliation_string": "university of portsmouth uk", "city": "portsmouth", "Name": "kim a bard"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Anton Batliner , Stefan Steidl , Dino Seppi , Bj\u00f6rn Schuller, Segmenting into adequate units for automatic recognition of emotion-related episodes: a speech-based approach, Advances in Human-Computer Interaction, 2010, p.1-15, January 2010[doi>10.1155/2010/782802]\n", "Anton Batliner , Stefan Steidl , Bj\u00f6rn Schuller , Dino Seppi , Thurid Vogt , Johannes Wagner , Laurence Devillers , Laurence Vidrascu , Vered Aharonson , Loic Kessous , Noam Amir, Whodunnit - Searching for the most important feature types signalling emotion-related user states in speech, Computer Speech and Language, v.25 n.1, p.4-28, January, 2011[doi>10.1016/j.csl.2009.12.003]\n", "Burkhardt, F., Paeschke, A., Rolfes, M., Sendlmeier, W., and Weiss, B. 2005.

In recent years there has been a shift in the field of affect recognition from \u201cin the lab\u201d experiments with acted data to \u201cin the wild\u201d experiments with spontaneous and naturalistic data. Two major issues thereby are the proper segmentation of the input and adequate description and modeling of affective states. The first issue is crucial for responsive, real-time systems such as virtual agents and robots, where the latency of the analysis must be as small as possible. To address this issue we introduce a novel method of incremental segmentation to be used in combination with supra-segmental modeling. For modeling of continuous affective states we use Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks, with which we can show an improvement in performance over standard recurrent neural networks and feed-forward neural networks as well as Support Vector Regression. For experiments we use the SEMAINE database, which contains recordings of spontaneous and natural human to Wizard-of-Oz conversations. The recordings are annotated continuously in time and magnitude with FeelTrace for five affective dimensions, namely activation, expectation, intensity, power/dominance, and valence. To exploit dependencies between the five affective dimensions we investigate multitask learning of all five dimensions augmented with inter-rater standard deviation. We can show improvements for multitask over single-task modeling. Correlation coefficients of up to 0.81 are obtained for the activation dimension and up to 0.58 for the valence dimension. The performance for the remaining dimensions were found to be in between that for activation and valence.", "authors": [{"name": "florian eyben", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81377594462"}, {"name": "martin wollmer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384616656"}, {"name": "bjorn schuller", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409595458"}], "title": "A multitask approach to continuous five-dimensional affect sensing in natural speech", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "26\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "265\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "martin wollmer", "city": null, "Name": "florian eyben"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Akinori Ito , Xinyue Wang , Motoyuki Suzuki , Shozo Makino, Smile and Laughter Recognition using Speech Processing and Face Recognition from Conversation Video, Proceedings of the 2005 International Conference on Cyberworlds, p.437-444, November 23-25, 2005[doi>10.1109/CW.2005.82]\n", "Bachorowski, J.-A., Smoski, M.

RSs play an important persuasion role, as they can potentially augment the users\u2019 trust towards in an application and orient their decisions or actions towards specific directions. This article explores the persuasiveness of RSs, presenting two vast empirical studies that address a number of research questions.First, we investigate if a design property of RSs, defined by the statistically measured quality of algorithms, is a reliable predictor of their potential for persuasion. This factor is measured in terms of perceived quality, defined by the overall satisfaction, as well as by how users judge the accuracy and novelty of recommendations. For our purposes, we designed an empirical study involving 210 subjects and implemented seven full-sized versions of a commercial RS, each one using the same interface and dataset (a subset of Netflix), but each with a different recommender algorithm. In each experimental configuration we computed the statistical quality (recall and F-measures) and collected data regarding the quality perceived by 30 users. The results show us that algorithmic attributes are less crucial than we might expect in determining the user\u2019s perception of an RS\u2019s quality, and suggest that the user\u2019s judgment and attitude towards a recommender are likely to be more affected by factors related to the user experience.Second, we explore the persuasiveness of RSs in the context of large interactive TV services. We report a study aimed at assessing whether measurable persuasion effects (e.g., changes of shopping behavior) can be achieved through the introduction of a recommender. Our data, collected for more than one year, allow us to conclude that, (1) the adoption of an RS can affect both the lift factor and the conversion rate, determining an increased volume of sales and influencing the user\u2019s decision to actually buy one of the recommended products, (2) the introduction of an RS tends to diversify purchases and orient users towards less obvious choices (the long tail), and (3) the perceived novelty of recommendations is likely to be more influential than their perceived accuracy.Overall, the results of these studies improve our understanding of the persuasion phenomena induced by RSs, and have implications that can be of interest to academic scholars, designers, and adopters of this class of systems.", "authors": [{"name": "paolo cremonesi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100653829"}, {"name": "franca garzotto", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100037686"}, {"name": "roberto turrin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81365594882"}], "title": "Investigating the Persuasion Potential of Recommender Systems from a Quality Perspective: An Empirical Study", "citations": [{"Name": "Paolo Cremonesi ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Antonella Di Rienzo ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Cristina Fr\u00e0 ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Franca Garzotto ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Luigi Oliveto ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Massimo Valla", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Petteri Nurmi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Antti Salovaara ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andreas Forsblom ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fabian Bohnert ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Patrik Flor\u00e9en", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dietmar Jannach ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lukas Lerche ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Iman Kamehkhosh ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michael Jugovac", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Douglas V\u00e9ras ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Thiago Prota ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alysson Bispo ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ricardo Prud\u00eancio ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Carlos Ferraz", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "A literature review of recommender systems in the television domain", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "120\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "824\n", "Citation Count": "12\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "politecnico di milano", "city": null, "Name": "paolo cremonesi"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "politecnico di milano", "city": null, "Name": "franca garzotto"}]}, "Article No.: 8": {"references": ["Aldenderfer, M.

The media bias problem has been studied extensively in mass communications and social science.

First, we describe the development and validation (N=\u2009215) of a questionnaire to measure individual susceptibility to different social influence strategies. To evaluate the external validity of this Susceptibility to Persuasion Scale (STPS) we set up a two week text-messaging intervention that used text messages implementing social influence strategies as prompts to reduce snacking behavior. In this experiment (N=\u200973) we show that messages that are personalized (tailored) to the individual based on their scores on the STPS, lead to a higher decrease in snacking consumption than randomized messages or messages that are not tailored (contra-tailored) to the individual. We discuss the importance of this finding for the design of persuasive systems and detail how designers can use tailoring at the level of social influence strategies to increase the effects of their persuasive technologies.", "authors": [{"name": "maurits kaptein", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435598360"}, {"name": "boris de ruyter", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100057549"}, {"name": "panos markopoulos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350577812"}, {"name": "emile aarts", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100007287"}], "title": "Adaptive Persuasive Systems: A Study of Tailored Persuasive Text Messages to Reduce Snacking", "citations": [{"Name": "Marc Busch ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Johann Schrammel ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Manfred Tscheligi", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marc Busch ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Elke Mattheiss ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rita Orji ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andrzej Marczewski ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wolfgang Hochleitner ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michael Lankes ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lennart E.

Persuasive technologies aim to modify user attitudes, intentions, or behavior through computer-human dialogue and social influence. While both personalized and persuasive technologies influence user interaction and behavior, we posit that this influence could be significantly increased if the two technologies were combined to createpersonalized and persuasivesystems. For example, the persuasive power of a one-size-fits-all persuasive intervention could be enhanced by considering the users being influenced and their susceptibility to the persuasion being offered. Likewise, personalized technologies could cash in on increased success, in terms of user satisfaction, revenue, and user experience, if their services used persuasive techniques. Hence, the coupling of personalization and persuasion has the potential to enhance the impact of both technologies.

We collected eye movements from subjects instructed to drive predetermined routes in a driving simulator. While driving, the subjects performed various cognitive tasks designed to divert their attention away from the road. The 30 subjects were equally divided in two groups, a control and a gaze guidance group. For the latter, potentially dangerous events, such as a pedestrian suddenly crossing the street, were highlighted with temporally transient gaze-contingent cues, which were triggered if the subject did not look at the pedestrian. For the group that drove with gaze guidance, eye movements have a reduced variability after the gaze-capturing event and shorter reaction times to it. More importantly, gaze guidance leads to a safer driving behavior and a significantly reduced number of collisions.", "authors": [{"name": "laura pomarjanschi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490693346"}, {"name": "michael dorr", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81311484681"}, {"name": "erhardt barth", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100581819"}], "title": "Gaze guidance reduces the number of collisions with pedestrians in a driving simulator", "citations": [{"Name": "Sandra Tr\u00f6sterer ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Martin Wuchse ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Christine D\u00f6ttlinger ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alexander Meschtscherjakov ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Manfred Tscheligi", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hyungil Kim ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alexandre Miranda Anon ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Teruhisa Misu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nanxiang Li ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ashish Tawari ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kikuo Fujimura", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "33\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "370\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of lubeck", "city": null, "Name": "laura pomarjanschi"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "harvard medical school", "city": null, "Name": "michael dorr"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of lubeck", "city": null, "Name": "erhardt barth"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Nikolaus Bee , Elisabeth Andr\u00e9, Writing with Your Eye: A Dwell Time Free Writing System Adapted to the Nature of Human Eye Gaze, Proceedings of the 4th IEEE tutorial and research workshop on Perception and Interactive Technologies for Speech-Based Systems: Perception in Multimodal Dialogue Systems, June 16-18, 2008, Kloster Irsee, Germany[doi>10.1007/978-3-540-69369-7_13]\n", "Amit Bleiweiss , Dagan Eshar , Gershom Kutliroff , Alon Lerner , Yinon Oshrat , Yaron Yanai, Enhanced interactive gaming by blending full-body tracking and gesture animation, ACM SIGGRAPH ASIA 2010 Sketches, p.1-2, December 15-18, 2010, Seoul, Republic of Korea[doi>10.1145/1899950.1899984]\n", "Andreas Bulling , Daniel Roggen , Gerhard Tr\u00f6ster, It's in your eyes: towards context-awareness and mobile HCI using wearable EOG goggles, Proceedings of the 10th international conference on Ubiquitous computing, September 21-24, 2008, Seoul, Korea[doi>10.1145/1409635.1409647]\n", "Chau, M. and Betke, M. 2005.

Gaze gestures can be tracked noninvasively employing a video-based eye tracking system. Gaze gestures hold the potential to become an emerging input paradigm in the context of human-computer interaction (HCI) as low-cost eye trackers become more ubiquitous. The viability of gaze gestures as an innovative way to control a computer rests on how easily they can be assimilated by potential users and also on the ability of machine learning algorithms to discriminate in real time intentional gaze gestures from typical gaze activity performed during standard interaction with electronic devices. In this work, through a set of experiments and user studies, we evaluate the performance of two different gaze gestures modalities, gliding gaze gestures and saccadic gaze gestures, and their corresponding real-time recognition algorithms, Hierarchical Temporal Memory networks and the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for sequence alignment. Our results show that a specific combination of gaze gesture modality, namely saccadic gaze gestures, and recognition algorithm, Needleman-Wunsch, allows for reliable usage of intentional gaze gestures to interact with a computer with accuracy rates higher than 95&percnt; and completion speeds of around 1.5 to 2.5 seconds per gesture. The optimal gaze gesture modality and recognition algorithm do not interfere with otherwise standard human-computer gaze interaction, generating very few false positives during real time recognition and positive feedback from the users. These encouraging results and the low cost eye tracking equipment used, open up a new HCI paradigm for the fields of accessibility and interaction with smartphones, tablets, projected displays and traditional desktop computers.", "authors": [{"name": "david rozado", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474697615"}, {"name": "javier s agustin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81416601511"}, {"name": "francisco b rodriguez", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81406599259"}, {"name": "pablo varona", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100266080"}], "title": "Gliding and saccadic gaze gesture recognition in real time", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "61\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "647\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "spain", "university": "universidad autonoma de madrid", "affiliation_string": "universidad autonoma de madrid spain", "city": "madrid", "Name": "david rozado"}, {"country": "denmark", "university": "it university of copenhagen", "affiliation_string": "it university of copenhagen denmark", "city": "kbenhavn", "Name": "javier s agustin"}, {"country": "spain", "university": "universidad autonoma de madrid", "affiliation_string": "universidad autonoma de madrid spain", "city": "madrid", "Name": "francisco b rodriguez"}, {"country": "spain", "university": "universidad autonoma de madrid", "affiliation_string": "universidad autonoma de madrid spain", "city": "madrid", "Name": "pablo varona"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2070719.2070720", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "Given the recent advances in eye tracking technology and the availability of nonintrusive and high-performance eye tracking devices, there has never been a better time to explore new opportunities to incorporate eye gaze in intelligent and natural human-machine communication.

Gaze cues and mechanisms are particularly instrumental in establishing the participant roles of interlocutors, managing speaker turns, and signaling discourse structure. If humanlike robots are to have fluent conversations with people, they will need to use these gaze mechanisms effectively. The current work investigates people's use of key conversational gaze mechanisms, how they might be designed for and implemented in humanlike robots, and whether these signals effectively shape human-robot conversations. We focus particularly on whether humanlike gaze mechanisms might help robots signal different participant roles, manage turn-exchanges, and shape how interlocutors perceive the robot and the conversation. The evaluation of these mechanisms involved 36 trials of three-party human-robot conversations. In these trials, the robot used gaze mechanisms to signal to its conversational partners their roles either of two addressees, an addressee and a bystander, or an addressee and a nonparticipant. Results showed that participants conformed to these intended roles 97&percnt; of the time. Their conversational roles affected their rapport with the robot, feelings of groupness with their conversational partners, and attention to the task.", "authors": [{"name": "bilge mutlu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310500023"}, {"name": "takayuki kanda", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81311482839"}, {"name": "jodi forlizzi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100492013"}, {"name": "jessica hodgins", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100049661"}, {"name": "hiroshi ishiguro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100572813"}], "title": "Conversational gaze mechanisms for humanlike robots", "citations": [{"Name": "Henny Admoni ", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bradley Hayes ", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "David Feil-Seifer ", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daniel Ullman ", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Brian Scassellati", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Elena Torta ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jim van Heumen ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Raymond H.

Moment-by-moment eye gaze plays an important role in such interaction and collaboration. In light of this, we used a novel experimental paradigm to systematically investigate gaze patterns in both human-human and human-agent interactions. Participants in the study were asked to interact with either another human or an embodied agent in a joint attention task. Fine-grained multimodal behavioral data were recorded including eye movement data, speech, first-person view video, which were then analyzed to discover various behavioral patterns. Those patterns show that human participants are highly sensitive to momentary multimodal behaviors generated by the social partner (either another human or an artificial agent) and they rapidly adapt their gaze behaviors accordingly. Our results from this data-driven approach provide new findings for understanding micro-behaviors in human-human communication which will be critical for the design of artificial agents that can generate human-like gaze behaviors and engage in multimodal interactions with humans.", "authors": [{"name": "chen yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100474961"}, {"name": "paul schermerhorn", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100573922"}, {"name": "matthias scheutz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100029514"}], "title": "Adaptive eye gaze patterns in interactions with human and artificial agents", "citations": [{"Name": "Henny Admoni ", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bradley Hayes ", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "David Feil-Seifer ", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daniel Ullman ", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Brian Scassellati", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lawrence Cavedon ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Christian Kroos ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Damith Herath ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Denis Burnham ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Laura Bishop ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yvonne Leung ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Catherine J.

Gaze has been shown to matter for a number of aspects of communication and dialogue, especially for managing the flow of the dialogue and participant attention, for deictic referencing, and for the communication of attitude. When developing embodied conversational agents (ECAs) and talking heads, modeling and delivering accurate gaze targets is crucial. Traditionally, systems communicating through talking heads have been displayed to the human conversant using 2D displays, such as flat monitors. This approach introduces severe limitations for an accurate communication of gaze since 2D displays are associated with several powerful effects and illusions, most importantly the Mona Lisa gaze effect, where the gaze of the projected head appears to follow the observer regardless of viewing angle. We describe the Mona Lisa gaze effect and its consequences in the interaction loop, and propose a new approach for displaying talking heads using a 3D projection surface (a physical model of a human head) as an alternative to the traditional flat surface projection. We investigate and compare the accuracy of the perception of gaze direction and the Mona Lisa gaze effect in 2D and 3D projection surfaces in a five subject gaze perception experiment. The experiment confirms that a 3D projection surface completely eliminates the Mona Lisa gaze effect and delivers very accurate gaze direction that is independent of the observer's viewing angle. Based on the data collected in this experiment, we rephrase the formulation of the Mona Lisa gaze effect. The data, when reinterpreted, confirms the predictions of the new model for both 2D and 3D projection surfaces. Finally, we discuss the requirements on different spatially interactive systems in terms of gaze direction, and propose new applications and experiments for interaction in a human-ECA and a human-robot settings made possible by this technology.", "authors": [{"name": "samer al moubayed", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81458649950"}, {"name": "jens edlund", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81381603781"}, {"name": "jonas beskow", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100428426"}], "title": "Taming Mona Lisa: Communicating gaze faithfully in 2D and 3D facial projections", "citations": [{"Name": "Samer Al Moubayed ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gabriel Skantze ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jonas Beskow", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gabriel Skantze ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Samer Al Moubayed", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "K.

Eye tracking can provide information on what document parts users read, and how they were read. This article aims at generating implicit relevance feedback from eye movements that can be used for information retrieval personalization and further applications.We report the findings from two studies which examine the relation between several eye movement measures and user-perceived relevance of read text passages. The results show that the measures are generally noisy, but after personalizing them we find clear relations between the measures and relevance. In addition, the second study demonstrates the effect of using reading behavior as implicit relevance feedback for personalizing search. The results indicate that gaze-based feedback is very useful and can greatly improve the quality of Web search. The article concludes with an outlook introducing attentive documents keeping track of how users consume them. Based on eye movement feedback, we describe a number of possible applications to make working with documents more effective.", "authors": [{"name": "georg buscher", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100009613"}, {"name": "andreas dengel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100610553"}, {"name": "ralf biedert", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81460653937"}, {"name": "ludger v elst", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350587120"}], "title": "Attentive documents: Eye tracking as implicit feedback for information retrieval and beyond", "citations": [{"Name": "Johannes Wagner ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Florian Lingenfelser ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Elisabeth Andr\u00e9 ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daniele Mazzei ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alessandro Tognetti ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Antonio Lanat\u00e0 ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Danilo De Rossi ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alberto Betella ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Riccardo Zucca ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Pedro Omedas ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Paul F.

In this work, we investigate the relevance feedback problem for interactive intelligent 3D object retrieval, with the focus on studying effective machine learning algorithms for improving the user's interaction in the retrieval task. One of the key challenges is to learn appropriate kernel similarity measure between 3D objects through the relevance feedback interaction with users. We address this challenge by presenting a novel framework ofActive multiple kernel learning(AMKL), which exploits multiple kernel learning techniques for relevance feedback in interactive 3D object retrieval. The proposed framework aims to efficiently identify an optimal combination of multiple kernels by asking the users to label the most informative 3D images. We evaluate the proposed techniques on a dataset of over 10,000 3D models collected from the World Wide Web. Our experimental results show that the proposed AMKL technique is significantly more effective for 3D object retrieval than the regular relevance feedback techniques widely used in interactive content-based image retrieval, and thus is promising for enhancing user's interaction in such interactive intelligent retrieval systems.", "authors": [{"name": "steven c h hoi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100337419"}, {"name": "rong jin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100054575"}], "title": "Active multiple kernel learning for interactive 3D object retrieval systems", "citations": [{"Name": "J.

To directly support end-user \u201cdebugging\u201d of assistant behaviors learned via statistical machine learning, we present a Why-oriented approach which allows users to ask questions about how the assistant made its predictions, provides answers to these \u201cwhy\u201d questions, and allows users to interactivelychangethese answers to debug the assistant's current and future predictions. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of this approach, we then conducted an exploratory study to investigate barriers that participants could encounter when debugging an intelligent assistant using our approach, and the information those participants requested to overcome these barriers. To help ensure the inclusiveness of our approach, we also explored how gender differences played a role in understanding barriers and information needs.

The first study looked at interaction styles and general features of robots. The second study looked at how the robot's attention influences children's behavior and engagement. Through activities familiar to young children (e.g., table setting, story telling), the first study found that cooperative interaction style elicited more oculesic behavior and social engagement. The second study found that quality of attention, type of attention, and length of interaction influences affective behavior and engagement. In the quality of attention, Wizard-of-Oz (woz) elicited the most affective behavior, but automatic attention worked as well as woz when the interaction was short. The type of attention going from nonverbal to verbal attention increased children's oculesic behavior, utterance, and physiological response. Affective interactions did not seem to depend on a single mechanism, but a well-chosen confluence of technical features.", "authors": [{"name": "sandra y okita", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81539605756"}, {"name": "victor ng-thow-hing", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100470377"}, {"name": "ravi k sarvadevabhatla", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490689260"}], "title": "Multimodal approach to affective human-robot interaction design with children", "citations": [{"Name": "Ginevra Castellano ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Laurel D.

Through recognition, sketches and diagrams can be interpreted and sent to simulators or other meaningful analyzers. Primitives are the basic building block shapes used by high-level visual grammars to describe the symbols of a given sketch domain. However, one limitation of these primitive recognizers is that they often only support basic shapes drawn with a single stroke. Furthermore, recognizers that do support multistroke primitives place additional constraints on users, such as temporal timeouts or modal button presses to signal shape completion. The goal of this research is twofold. First, we wanted to determine the drawing habits of most users. Our studies found multistroke primitives to be more prevalent than multiple primitives drawn in a single stroke. Additionally, our studies confirmed that threading is less frequent when there are more sides to a figure. Next, we developed an algorithm that is capable of recognizing multistroke primitives without requiring special drawing constraints. The algorithm uses a graph-building and search technique that takes advantage of Tarjan's linear search algorithm, along with principles to determine the goodness of a fit. Our novel, constraint-free recognizer achieves accuracy rates of 96&percnt; on freely-drawn primitives.", "authors": [{"name": "tracy hammond", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309486982"}, {"name": "brandon paulson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351599339"}], "title": "Recognizing sketched multistroke primitives", "citations": [{"Name": "Jie Wu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Changhu Wang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Liqing Zhang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yong Rui", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Melissa Roemmele ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Soja-Marie Morgens ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andrew S.
