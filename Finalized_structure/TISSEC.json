Despite the recent advances, location discovery for sensor networks inhostile environmentshas been mostly overlooked. Most of the existing localization protocols for sensor networks are vulnerable in hostile environments. The security of location discovery can certainly be enhanced by authentication. However, the possible node compromises and the fact that location determination uses certain physical features (e.g., received signal strength) of radio signals make authentication not as effective as in traditional security applications. This article presents two methods to tolerate malicious attacks against range-based location discovery in sensor networks. The first method filters out malicious beacon signals on the basis of the \u201cconsistency\u201d among multiple beacon signals, while the second method tolerates malicious beacon signals by adopting an iteratively refined voting scheme. Both methods can survive malicious attacks even if the attacks bypass authentication, provided that the benign beacon signals constitute the majority of the beacon signals. This article also presents the implementation and experimental evaluation (through both field experiments and simulation) of all the secure and resilient location estimation schemes that can be used on the current generation of sensor platforms (e.g., MICA series of motes), including the techniques proposed in this article, in a network of MICAz motes. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, and also give the secure and resilient location estimation scheme most suitable for the current generation of sensor networks.", "authors": [{"name": "donggang liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452595951"}, {"name": "peng ning", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332518403"}, {"name": "an liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339514272"}, {"name": "cliff wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81450593217"}, {"name": "wenliang kevin du", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81545376056"}], "title": "Attack-Resistant Location Estimation in Wireless Sensor Networks", "citations": [{"Name": "Yingpei Zeng ", "Country": "hungary", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jiannong Cao ", "Country": "hungary", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shigeng Zhang ", "Country": "hungary", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shanqing Guo ", "Country": "hungary", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Li Xie", "Country": "hungary", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Adnan M.

In this work we propose a novel framework for detection of intelligent adaptive adversaries in the IEEE 802.11 MAC by addressing the problem of detection of the worst-case scenario attacks. Utilizing the nature of this protocol we employ sequential detection methods for detecting greedy behavior and illustrate their performance for detection of least favorable attacks. By using robust statistics in our problem formulation, we attempt to utilize the precision given by parametric tests, while avoiding the specification of the adversarial distribution. This approach establishes the lowest performance bound of a given Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in terms of detection delay and is applicable in online detection systems where users who pay for their services want to obtain the information about the best and the worst case scenarios and performance bounds of the system. This framework is meaningful for studying misbehavior due to the fact that it does not focus on specific adversarial strategies and therefore is applicable to a wide class of adversarial strategies.", "authors": [{"name": "svetlana radosavac", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100438607"}, {"name": "george moustakides", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100342215"}, {"name": "john s baras", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100067511"}, {"name": "iordanis koutsopoulos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100573890"}], "title": "An Analytic Framework for Modeling and Detecting Access Layer Misbehavior in Wireless Networks", "citations": [{"Name": "Avesh K.

This toolbox includes protocols for secure pairwise and group synchronization of nodes that either lie in the neighborhood of each other or are separated by multiple hops.

Its main purpose is to identify potentially intrusive events and alert the security personnel to the danger. A typical intrusion detection system, however, is known to be imperfect in detection of intrusive events, resulting in high false-alarm rates. Nevertheless, current intrusion detection models unreasonably assume that upon alerts raised by a system, an information security officer responds to all alarms without any delay and avoids damages of hostile activities. This assumption of responding to all alarms with no time lag is often impracticable. As a result, the benefit of an intrusion detection system can be overestimated by current intrusion detection models. In this article, we extend previous models by including an information security officer's alarm inspection under a constraint as a part of the process in determining the optimal intrusion detection policy. Given a potentially hostile environment for a firm, in which the intrusion rates and costs associated with intrusion and security officers' inspection can be estimated, we outline a framework to establish the optimal operating points for intrusion detection systems under security officers' inspection constraint. The optimal solution to the model will provide not only a basis of better evaluation of intrusion detection systems but also useful insights into operations of intrusion detection systems. The firm can estimate expected benefits for running intrusion detection systems and establish a basis for increase in security personnel to relax security officers' inspection constraint.", "authors": [{"name": "young u ryu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100170356"}, {"name": "hyeun-suk rhee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452594648"}], "title": "Evaluation of Intrusion Detection Systems Under a Resource Constraint", "citations": [{"Name": "Chien-Cheng Huang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Feng-Yu Lin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Frank Yeong-Sung Lin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yeali S.

However, because individual sensor readings are lost in the per-hop aggregation process, compromised nodes in the network may forge false values as the aggregation results of other nodes, tricking the base station into accepting spurious aggregation results. Here a fundamental challenge is how can the base station obtain a good approximation of the fusion result when a fraction of sensor nodes are compromised?To answer this challenge, we propose SDAP, a Secure Hop-by-hop Data Aggregation Protocol for sensor networks. SDAP is a general-purpose secure data aggregation protocol applicable to multiple aggregation functions. The design of SDAP is based on the principles ofdivide-and-conquerandcommit-and-attest. First, SDAP uses a novel probabilistic grouping technique to dynamically partition the nodes in a tree topology into multiple logical groups (subtrees) of similar sizes. A commitment-based hop-by-hop aggregation is performed in each group to generate a group aggregate. The base station then identifies the suspicious groups based on the set of group aggregates. Finally, each group under suspect participates in an attestation process to prove the correctness of its group aggregate. The aggregate by the base station is calculated over all the group aggregates that are either normal or have passed the attestation procedure. Extensive analysis and simulations show that SDAP can achieve the level of efficiency close to an ordinary hop-by-hop aggregation protocol while providing high assurance on the trustworthiness of the aggregation result.

We especially provide a thorough analysis of the latter variant, whose performances have never been formally calculated yet. Our analysis leads to the concept of acharacteristicthat enables to measure the intrinsic quality of a trade-off. We finally introduce a new technique based oncheckpointsthat still reduces the cryptanalysis time by ruling out false alarms probabilistically.

This heterogeneous distribution of resources and the various modes of collaborations that exist between users, virtual organizations, and resource providers require scalable, flexible, and fine-grained access control to protect both individual and shared computing resources. In this article we propose a usage control (UCON) based security framework for collaborative applications, by following a layered approach with policy, enforcement, and implementation models, called the PEI framework. In the policy model layer, UCON policies are specified with predicates on subject and object attributes, along with system attributes as conditional constraints and user actions as obligations. General attributes include not only persistent attributes such as role and group memberships but also mutable usage attributes of subjects and objects. Conditions in UCON can be used to support context-based authorizations in ad hoc collaborations. In the enforcement model layer, our novel framework uses a hybrid approach for subject attribute acquisition with both push and pull modes. By leveraging attribute propagations between a centralized attribute repository and distributed policy decision points, our architecture supports decision continuity and attribute mutability of the UCON policy model, as well as obligation evaluations during policy enforcement. As a proof-of-concept, we implement a prototype system based on our proposed architecture and conduct experimental studies to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of our approach.", "authors": [{"name": "xinwen zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351603781"}, {"name": "masayuki nakae", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314490572"}, {"name": "michael j covington", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339495476"}, {"name": "ravi sandhu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81312485832"}], "title": "Toward a Usage-Based Security Framework for Collaborative Computing Systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Srijith K.

Researchers have shown that trust negotiation is indeed a viable solution for these environments by developing a number of policy languages and strategies for trust negotiation that have desirable theoretical properties. Further, existing protocols, such as TLS, have been altered to interact with prototype trust negotiation systems, thereby illustrating the utility of trust negotiation. Unfortunately, modifying existing protocols is often a time-consuming and bureaucratic process that can hinder the adoption of this promising technology.In this paper, we present Traust, a third-party authorization service that leverages the strengths of existing prototype trust negotiation systems. Traust acts as an authorization broker that issues access tokens for resources in an open system after entities use trust negotiation to satisfy the appropriate resource access policies. The Traust architecture was designed to allow Traust to be integrated either directly with newer trust-aware applications or indirectly with existing legacy applications; this flexibility paves the way for the incremental adoption of trust negotiation technologies without requiring widespread software or protocol upgrades. We discuss the design and implementation of Traust, the communication protocol used by the Traust system, and its performance. We also discuss our experiences using Traust to broker access to legacy resources, our proposal for a Traust-aware version of the GridFTP protocol, and Traust's resilience to attack.", "authors": [{"name": "adam j lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100385390"}, {"name": "marianne winslett", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100471278"}, {"name": "jim basney", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100041338"}, {"name": "von welch", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100043515"}], "title": "The Traust Authorization Service", "citations": [{"Name": "Anna C.

However, such networks are extremely vulnerable to message-dropping attacks by malicious or selfish nodes that intentionally drop the packets they are required to forward to others. It is difficult to detect such attacks both efficiently and effectively and to further identify the attackers, especially when members in the overlay switch between online/offline statuses frequently. In this article, we consider various attacking strategies of an attacker and propose an optimal sampling-based scheme to detect such attacks in the overlay network. We analyze the detection problem from a game-theoretical viewpoint and show that our scheme outperforms a random sampling-based scheme in terms of detection rate. In addition, based on a reputation system, we propose a sampling-based path-resolving scheme to identify compromised or selfish nodes. Unlike other existing approaches, our schemes do not assume global knowledge of the overlay hierarchy and work for dynamic overlay networks as well. Extensive analysis and simulation results show that besides being band width efficient, our schemes have high detection and identification rates and low false-positive rates.", "authors": [{"name": "liang xie", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409592491"}, {"name": "sencun zhu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100413888"}], "title": "Message Dropping Attacks in Overlay Networks: Attack Detection and Attacker Identification", "citations": [{"Name": "Mohamed Elsalih Mahmoud ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xuemin Shen", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jeff Seibert ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xin Sun ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Cristina Nita-Rotaru ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sanjay Rao", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "A design for securing data delivery in mesh-based peer-to-peer streaming", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "20\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "823\n", "Citation Count": "4\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the pennsylvania state university", "city": null, "Name": "liang xie"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the pennsylvania state university", "city": null, "Name": "sencun zhu"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Alfarez Abdul-Rahman , Stephen Hailes, A distributed trust model, Proceedings of the 1997 workshop on New security paradigms, p.48-60, September 23-26, 1997, Langdale, Cumbria, United Kingdom[doi>10.1145/283699.283739]\n", "Atmel. 8-bit AVR microcontroller with 128 KBytes in-system programmable flash --- ATmega128, ATmega128L. www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc2467.pdf.\n", "Bauer, K. and Lee, H.2005.

The severe resource constraints in each sensor make it very challenging to secure sensor networks. Moreover, sensors are usually deployed in hostile and unattended environments and hence are susceptible to various attacks, including node capture, physical tampering, and manipulation of the sensor program. Park and Shin [2005] proposed a soft tamper-proofing scheme that verifies the integrity of the program in each sensor device, called theprogram integrity verification(PIV), in which sensors authenticate PIV servers (PIVSs) using centralized and trusted third-party entities, such as authentication servers (ASs). This article presents a distributed authentication protocol of PIVSs (DAPP) without requiring the commonly used ASs. DAPP uses the Blundo scheme [Blundo et al. 1992] for sensors and PIVSs to establish pairwise keys and for PIVSs to authenticate one another. We also present a protocol for PIVSs to cooperatively detect and revoke malicious PIVSs in the network. We implement and evaluate both DAPP and PIV on Mica2 Motes and laptops, showing that DAPP reduces the sensors' communication traffic in the network by more than 90&percnt; and the energy consumption on each sensor by up to 85&percnt;, as compared to the case of using a centralized AS for authenticating PIVSs.

Such difficulties are particularly pronounced when uncontrolled or unknown platforms join public networks. Commonly practiced techniques used to vet these hosts, such as system scans, have the potential to infringe on the privacy of users. In this article, we show that it is possible for clients to prove both the presence and proper functioning of security infrastructure without allowing unrestricted access to their system. We demonstrate this approach, specifically applied to antivirus security, by requiring clients seeking admission to a network to positively identify the presence or absence of malcode in a series of puzzles. The implementation of this mechanism and its application to real networks are also explored. In so doing, we demonstrate that it is not necessary for an administrator to be invasive to determine whether a client implements required security practices.", "authors": [{"name": "patrick traynor", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309504558"}, {"name": "michael chien", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350568322"}, {"name": "scott weaver", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81536756856"}, {"name": "boniface hicks", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314489536"}, {"name": "patrick mcdaniel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100363624"}], "title": "Noninvasive Methods for Host Certification", "citations": [{"Name": "Fabrizio Baiardi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daniele Sgandurra", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Attestation of integrity of overlay networks", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "19\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "619\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "systems and internet infrastructure security siis lab the pennsylvania state university", "city": null, "Name": "patrick traynor"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "systems and internet infrastructure security siis lab the pennsylvania state university", "city": null, "Name": "michael chien"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "systems and internet infrastructure security siis lab the pennsylvania state university", "city": null, "Name": "scott weaver"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "systems and internet infrastructure security siis lab the pennsylvania state university", "city": null, "Name": "boniface hicks"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "systems and internet infrastructure security siis lab the pennsylvania state university", "city": null, "Name": "patrick mcdaniel"}]}, "Article No.: 12": {"references": ["Karl Aberer , Zoran Despotovic, Managing trust in a peer-2-peer information system, Proceedings of the tenth international conference on Information and knowledge management, October 05-10, 2001, Atlanta, Georgia, USA[doi>10.1145/502585.502638]\n", "Toru Araki , Yukio Shibata, (t, k)-Diagnosable System: A Generalization of the PMC Models, IEEE Transactions on Computers, v.52 n.7, p.971-975, July 2003[doi>10.1109/TC.2003.1214345]\n", "Prosenjit Bose , Pat Morin , Ivan Stojmenovi\u0107 , Jorge Urrutia, Routing with guaranteed delivery in ad hoc wireless networks, Wireless Networks, v.7 n.6, p.609-616, November 2001[doi>10.1023/A:1012319418150]\n", "Camtepe, S. and Yener, B.2004.

Once a node's cryptographic key is compromised, an attacker may completely impersonate it and introduce arbitrary false information into the network. Basic cryptographic mechanisms are often not effective in this situation. Most techniques to address this problem focus on detecting and tolerating false information introduced by compromised nodes. They cannot pinpoint exactly where the false information is introduced and who is responsible for it.In this article, we propose an application-independent framework for accurately identifying compromised sensor nodes. The framework provides an appropriate abstraction of application-specific detection mechanisms and models the unique properties of sensor networks. Based on the framework, we develop alert reasoning algorithms to identify compromised nodes. The algorithm assumes that compromised nodes may collude at will. We show that our algorithm is optimal in the sense that it identifies the largest number of compromised nodes without introducing false positives. We evaluate the effectiveness of the designed algorithm through comprehensive experiments.", "authors": [{"name": "qing zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350580546"}, {"name": "ting yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100471558"}, {"name": "peng ning", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332518403"}], "title": "A Framework for Identifying Compromised Nodes in Wireless Sensor Networks", "citations": [{"Name": "Cheryl V.

We also show how to set the parameters---pool and key ring size---in such a way that the network is not only connected with high probability via secure links but also provably resilient, in the following sense: We formally show that any adversary that captures sensors at random with the aim of compromising a constant fraction of the secure links must capture at least a constant fraction of the nodes of the network. In the context of wireless sensor networks where random predistribution of keys is employed, we are the first to provide a mathematically precise proof, with a clear indication of parameter choice, that two crucial properties---connectivity via secure links and resilience against malicious attacks---can be obtained simultaneously. We also show in a mathematically rigorous way that the network enjoys another strong security property. The adversary cannot partition the network into two linear size components, compromising all the links between them, unless it captures linearly many nodes. This implies that the network is also fault tolerant with respect to node failures. Our theoretical results are complemented by extensive simulations that reinforce our main conclusions.", "authors": [{"name": "roberto di pietro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100340827"}, {"name": "luigi v mancini", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100207839"}, {"name": "alessandro mei", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100215027"}, {"name": "alessandro panconesi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100071705"}, {"name": "jaikumar radhakrishnan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100434965"}], "title": "Redoubtable Sensor Networks", "citations": [{"Name": "Osman Ya\u011fan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Armand M.

In previous work, we analyzed the success of such attacks under various assumptions. Here, we evaluate the effects of these assumptions more closely. First, we analyze the Onion Routing-based model used in prior work in which a fixed set of nodes remains in the system indefinitely. We show that for this model, by removing the assumption of uniformly random selection of nodes for placement in the path, initiators can greatly improve their anonymity. Second, we show by simulation that attack times are significantly lower in practice than bounds given by analytical results from prior work. Third, we analyze the effects of a dynamic membership model, in which nodes are allowed to join and leave the system; we show that all known defenses fail more quickly when the assumption of a static node set is relaxed. Fourth, intersection attacks against peer-to-peer systems are shown to be an additional danger, either on their own or in conjunction with the predecessor attack. Finally, we address the question of whether the regular communication patterns required by the attacks exist in real traffic. We collected and analyzed the Web requests of users to determine the extent to which basic patterns can be found. We show that, for our study, frequent and repeated communication to the same Web site is common.", "authors": [{"name": "matthew k wright", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100659958"}, {"name": "micah adler", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100059176"}, {"name": "brian neil levine", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100230239"}, {"name": "clay shields", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100527773"}], "title": "Passive-Logging Attacks Against Anonymous Communications Systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Gauri Vakde ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Radhika Bibikar ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zhengyi Le ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Matthew Wright", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zhengyi Le ", "Country": "greece", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gauri Vakde ", "Country": "greece", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Matthew Wright", "Country": "greece", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "N.

The convenience of wireless network access at work may be extremely beneficial to employees, but can be a burden to network security personnel. This burden is magnified by the threat of inexpensive wireless access points being installed in a network without the knowledge of network administrators. These devices, termed <it>Rogue Wireless Access Points</it>, may allow a malicious outsider to access valuable network resources, including confidential communication and other stored data. For this reason, wireless connectivity detection is an essential capability, but remains a difficult problem. We present a method of detecting wireless hosts using a local RTT metric and a novel packet payload slicing technique. The local RTT metric provides the means to identify physical transmission media while packet payload slicing conditions network traffic to enhance the accuracy of the detections. Most importantly, the packet payload slicing method is transparent to both clients and servers and does not require direct communication between the monitoring system and monitored hosts.", "authors": [{"name": "chad d mano", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375610673"}, {"name": "andrew blaich", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350571724"}, {"name": "qi liao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81537326456"}, {"name": "yingxin jiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81312484485"}, {"name": "david a cieslak", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350572439"}, {"name": "david c salyers", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81337492915"}, {"name": "aaron striegel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100088737"}], "title": "RIPPS: Rogue Identifying Packet Payload Slicer Detecting Unauthorized Wireless Hosts Through Network Traffic Conditioning", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "38\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "610\n", "Citation Count": "7\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of notre dame", "city": null, "Name": "chad d mano"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of notre dame", "city": null, "Name": "andrew blaich"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of notre dame", "city": null, "Name": "qi liao"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of notre dame", "city": null, "Name": "yingxin jiang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of notre dame", "city": null, "Name": "david a cieslak"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of notre dame", "city": null, "Name": "david c salyers"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of notre dame", "city": null, "Name": "aaron striegel"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["R Blom, An optimal class of symmetric key generation systems, Proc. of the EUROCRYPT 84 workshop on Advances in cryptology: theory and application of cryptographic techniques, p.335-338, December 1985, Paris, France\n", "Carlo Blundo , Alfredo De Santis , Ugo Vaccaro , Amir Herzberg , Shay Kutten , Moti Yong, Perfectly secure key distribution for dynamic conferences, Information and Computation, v.146 n.1, p.1-23, Oct. 10, 1998[doi>10.1006/inco.1998.2717]\n", "Carmen, D., Kruus, P., and Matt, B.2000.

In particular, this paper focuses on <it>unconditional full privacy</it>, i.e., privacy that relies neither on trusted third parties (like auctioneers), nor on computational intractability assumptions (like the hardness of factoring). These constraints imply a scenario in which bidders exchange messages according to some predefined protocol in order to jointly determine the auction outcome without revealing any additional information. It turns out that the first-price sealed-bid auction can be emulated by an unconditionally fully private protocol. However, the protocol's round complexity is exponential in the bid size, and there is no more efficient protocol. On the other hand, we prove the impossibility of privately emulating the second-price sealed-bid auction for more than two bidders. This impossibility holds even when relaxing various privacy constraints such as allowing the revelation of all but one losing bid (while maintaining anonymity) or allowing the revelation of the second highest bidder's identity.", "authors": [{"name": "felix brandt", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100446474"}, {"name": "tuomas sandholm", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100367056"}], "title": "On the Existence of Unconditionally Privacy-Preserving Auction Protocols", "citations": [{"Name": "Arpita Ghosh ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Katrina Ligett", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Joan Feigenbaum ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Aaron D.

We then give several provably-secure constructions of timed-release encryption: a generic scheme based on any identity-based encryption scheme, and two more efficient schemes based on the existence of cryptographically admissible bilinear mappings. The first of these is essentially as efficient as the Boneh-Franklin Identity-Based encryption scheme, and is provably secure and authenticated in the random oracle model; the final scheme is not authenticated but is provably secure in the standard model (i.e., without random oracles).", "authors": [{"name": "jung hee cheon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100075160"}, {"name": "nicholas hopper", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100172412"}, {"name": "yongdae kim", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100658424"}, {"name": "ivan osipkov", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81317498712"}], "title": "Provably Secure Timed-Release Public Key Encryption", "citations": [{"Name": "Yohei Watanabe ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Takenobu Seito ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Junji Shikata", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yasumasa Nakai ", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Takahiro Matsuda ", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wataru Kitada ", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kanta Matsuura", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "A Generic Construction of Timed-Release Encryption with Pre-open Capability", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Keita Emura ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Akira Kanaoka ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Satoshi Ohta ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Takeshi Takahashi", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "32\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "1369\n", "Citation Count": "11\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "philippines", "university": "national university", "affiliation_string": "seoul national university korea", "city": "manila", "Name": "jung hee cheon"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of minnesota - twin cities", "city": null, "Name": "nicholas hopper"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of minnesota - twin cities", "city": null, "Name": "yongdae kim"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of minnesota - twin cities", "city": null, "Name": "ivan osipkov"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2008"}}}, "Volume9": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Pages: 391-420": {"references": ["Gail-Joon Ahn , Ravi Sandhu, Role-based authorization constraints specification, ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC), v.3 n.4, p.207-226, Nov. 2000[doi>10.1145/382912.382913]\n", "Crampton, J. 2002.

In order to administer such systems, decentralization of administration tasks by the use of delegation is an effective approach. While the use of delegation greatly enhances flexibility and scalability, it may reduce the control that an organization has over its resources, thereby diminishing a major advantage RBAC has over discretionary access control (DAC). We propose to use security analysis techniques to maintain desirable security properties while delegating administrative privileges. We give a precise definition of a family of security analysis problems in RBAC, which is more general than safety analysis that is studied in the literature. We show that two classes of problems in the family can be reduced to similar analysis in the RT[&Larr;\u2229] role-based trust-management language, thereby establishing an interesting relationship between RBAC and theRTframework. The reduction gives efficient algorithms for answering most kinds of queries in these two classes and establishes the complexity bounds for the intractable cases.", "authors": [{"name": "ninghui li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100475364"}, {"name": "mahesh v tripunitara", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100295811"}], "title": "Security analysis in role-based access control", "citations": [{"Name": "Puneet Gupta ", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Scott D.

Anomaly-based IDSs build models of the expected behavior of applications by analyzing events that are generated during the applications' normal operation. Once these models have been established, subsequent events are analyzed to identify deviations, on the assumption that anomalies represent evidence of an attack. Host-based anomaly detection systems often rely on system call sequences to characterize the normal behavior of applications. Recently, it has been shown how these systems can be evaded by launching attacks that execute legitimate system call sequences. The evasion is possible because existing techniques do not take into account all available features of system calls. In particular, system call arguments are not considered. We propose two primary improvements upon existing host-based anomaly detectors. First, we apply multiple detection models to system call arguments. Multiple models allow the arguments of each system call invocation to be evaluated from several different perspectives. Second, we introduce a sophisticated method of combining the anomaly scores from each model into an overall aggregate score. The combined anomaly score determines whether an event is part of an attack. Individual anomaly scores are often contradicting and, therefore, a simple weighted sum cannot deliver reliable results. To address this problem, we propose a technique that uses Bayesian networks to perform system call classification. We show that the analysis of system call arguments and the use of Bayesian classification improves detection accuracy and resilience against evasion attempts. In addition, the paper describes a tool based on our approach and provides a quantitative evaluation of its performance in terms of both detection effectiveness and overhead. A comparison with four related approaches is also presented.", "authors": [{"name": "darren mutz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100347732"}, {"name": "fredrik valeur", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100574475"}, {"name": "giovanni vigna", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100618984"}, {"name": "christopher kruegel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100422599"}], "title": "Anomalous system call detection", "citations": [{"Name": "Gianluca Dini ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fabio Martinelli ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andrea Saracino ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daniele Sgandurra", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "MADAM: a multi-level anomaly detector for android malware", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Proceedings of the 6th international conference on Mathematical Methods", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shekhar R.

Attacks to the security of a statistical database may be direct or indirect and, in order to repel them, the query system should audit queries by controlling the amount of information released by their responses. This paper focuses on sum-queries with a response variable of nonnegative real type and proposes a compact representation of answered sum-queries, called an information model in \u201cnormal form,\u201d which allows the query system to decide whether the value of a new sum-query can or cannot be safely answered. If it cannot, then the query system will issue the range of feasible values of the new sum-query consistent with previously answered sum-queries. Both the management of the information model and the answering procedure require solving linear-programming problems and, since standard linear-programming algorithms are not polynomially bounded (despite their good performances in practice), effective procedures that make a parsimonious use of them are stated for the general case. Moreover, in the special case that the information model is \u201cgraphical.\u201d It is shown that the answering procedure can be implemented in polynomial time.", "authors": [{"name": "francesco m malvestuto", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100097052"}, {"name": "mauro mezzini", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100597735"}, {"name": "marina moscarini", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100646570"}], "title": "Auditing sum-queries to make a statistical database secure", "citations": [{"Name": "Filippo Furfaro ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Giuseppe M.

We predict that fast and secure re-encryption will become increasingly popular as a method for managing encrypted file systems. Although efficiently computable, the wide-spread adoption of BBS re-encryption has been hindered by considerable security risks. Following recent work of Dodis and Ivan, we present new re-encryption schemes that realize a stronger notion of security and demonstrate the usefulness of proxy re-encryption as a method of adding access control to a secure file system. Performance measurements of our experimental file system demonstrate that proxy re-encryption can work effectively in practice.", "authors": [{"name": "giuseppe ateniese", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100005982"}, {"name": "kevin fu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100244796"}, {"name": "matthew green", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329488886"}, {"name": "susan hohenberger", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81326490028"}], "title": "Improved proxy re-encryption schemes with applications to secure distributed storage", "citations": [{"Name": "Peng Wang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chinya V.

However such access-control policies are burdens to the query engines for XML documents. To relieve this burden, we introduce static analysis for XML access-control. Given an access-control policy, query expression, and an optional schema, static analysis determines if this query expression is guaranteed not to access elements or attributes that are hidden by the access-control policy but permitted by the schema. Static analysis can be performed without evaluating any query expression against actual XML documents. Run-time checking is required only when static analysis is unable to determine whether to grant or deny access requests. A side effect of static analysis is query optimization: access-denied expressions in queries can be evaluated to empty lists at compile time. We further extend static analysis for handling value-based access-control policies and introduce view schemas.", "authors": [{"name": "makoto murata", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100488070"}, {"name": "akihiko tozawa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100142483"}, {"name": "michiharu kudo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100510805"}, {"name": "satoshi hada", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100626271"}], "title": "XML access control using static analysis", "citations": [{"Name": "Loreto Bravo ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "James Cheney ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Irini Fundulaki", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "ACCOn: checking consistency of XML write-access control policies", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hong Zhu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kevin L\u00fc ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Renchao Jin", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "A practical mandatory access control model for XML databases", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Houari Mahfoud ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Abdessamad Imine ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Micha\u00ebl Rusinowitch", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kaziim Sarikaya ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Duygu Sarikaya ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tamer N.

In the systems we consider, decryption of keys is done on smartcards and key management is done in-band. Our starting point is a scheme of Naor and Pinkas. Their basic scheme uses secret sharing to remove up totparties, is information-theoretic secure against coalitions of sizet, and is capable of creating a new group key. However, with current smartcard technology, this scheme is only feasible for small system parameters, allowing up to about 100 pirates to be revoked before all the smartcards need to be replaced. We first present a novel implementation method of their basic scheme that distributes the work among the smartcard, set-top terminal, and center. Based on this, we construct several improved schemes for many revocation rounds that scale to realistic system sizes. We allow up to about 10,000 pirates to be revoked using current smartcard technology before recarding is needed. The transmission lengths of our constructions are on par with those of the best tree-based schemes. However, our constructions have much lower smartcard CPU complexity: onlyO(1) smartcard operations per revocation round (a single 10-byte field multiplication and addition), as opposed to the complexity of the best tree-based schemes, which is polylogarithmic in the number of users. We evaluate the system behavior via an exhaustive simulation study coupled with a queueing theory analysis. Our simulations show that with mild assumptions on the piracy discovery rate, our constructions can perform effective pirate revocation for realistic broadcast encryption scenarios.", "authors": [{"name": "noam kogan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100567441"}, {"name": "yuval shavitt", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100571833"}, {"name": "avishai wool", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100392574"}], "title": "A practical revocation scheme for broadcast encryption using smartcards", "citations": [{"Name": "Ragib Hasan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Radu Sion ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marianne Winslett", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "26\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "722\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "israel", "university": "tel aviv university", "affiliation_string": "tel aviv university ramat aviv israel", "city": "tel aviv yafo", "Name": "noam kogan"}, {"country": "israel", "university": "tel aviv university", "affiliation_string": "tel aviv university ramat aviv israel", "city": "tel aviv yafo", "Name": "yuval shavitt"}, {"country": "israel", "university": "tel aviv university", "affiliation_string": "tel aviv university ramat aviv israel", "city": "tel aviv yafo", "Name": "avishai wool"}]}, "Pages: 235-258": {"references": ["Abadi, M., Burrows, M., Manasse, M., and Wobber, T. 2003.

Automated Trust Negotiation (ATN) is an approach to regulate the exchange of sensitive information during this process. It treats credentials as potentially sensitive resources, access to which is under policy control. Negotiations that correctly enforce policies have been called \u201csafe\u201d in the literature. Prior work on ATN lacks an adequate definition of this safety notion. In large part, this is because fundamental questions such as \u201cwhat needs to be protected in ATN?\u201d and \u201cwhat are the security requirements?\u201d are not adequately answered. As a result, many prior methods of ATN have serious security holes. We introduce a formal framework for ATN in which we give precise, usable, and intuitive definitions of correct enforcement of policies in ATN. We argue that our chief safety notion captures intuitive security goals. We give precise comparisons of this notion with two alternative safety notions that may seem intuitive, but that are seen to be inadequate under closer inspection. We prove that an approach to ATN from the literature meets the requirements set forth in the preferred safety definition, thus validating the safety of that approach, as well as the usability of the definition.", "authors": [{"name": "william h winsborough", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100048685"}, {"name": "ninghui li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100475364"}], "title": "Safety in automated trust negotiation", "citations": [{"Name": "Isaac Agudo ", "Country": "greece", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Javier Lopez ", "Country": "greece", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jose A.

However, existing frameworks provide limited facilities for the automated reconciliation of participant policies. This paper considers the limits and methods of reconciliation in a general-purpose policy model. We identify an algorithm for efficient two-policy reconciliation and show that, in the worst-case, reconciliation of three or more policies is intractable. Further, we suggest efficient heuristics for the detection and resolution of intractable reconciliation. Based upon the policy model, we describe the design and implementation of the Ismene policy language. The expressiveness of Ismene, and indirectly of our model, is demonstrated through the representation and exposition of policies supported by existing policy languages. We conclude with brief notes on the integration and enforcement of Ismene policy within the Antigone communication system.", "authors": [{"name": "patrick mcdaniel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100363624"}, {"name": "atul prakash", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100516701"}], "title": "Methods and limitations of security policy reconciliation", "citations": [{"Name": "Zhengping Wu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yuanyao Liu", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Knowledge-Based Policy Conflict Analysis in Mobile Social Networks", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nirupama Talele ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jason Teutsch ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Trent Jaeger ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Robert F.

When we apply RBAC model to large enterprises, effective role administration is a major issue. ARBAC97 is a well-known solution for decentralized RBAC administration. ARBAC97 authorizes administrative roles by means of role ranges and prerequisite conditions, where prerequisite conditions effectively work as a restricted pool for administrative roles to pick users or permissions. Although attractive and elegant in their own right, these mechanisms have significant shortcomings. In this paper, we propose an improved role administration model named ARBAC02 to overcome the weaknesses of ARBAC97. ARBAC02 introduces the concept of organization structure for defining user and permission pools independent of roles and role hierarchies, with a refined prerequisite condition specification. In addition, we present a bottom-up approach of permission-role administration in contrast to the top-down approach in ARBAC97. As a general solution, we illustrate the applications of organization structured-based security administration with other access control models, such as access control list model and lattice-based access control model.", "authors": [{"name": "sejong oh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100060161"}, {"name": "ravi sandhu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81312485832"}, {"name": "xinwen zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351603781"}], "title": "An effective role administration model using organization structure", "citations": [{"Name": "Muntaha Alawneh ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Imad M.

Our protocol is actually an abstraction of the key exchange protocol of Katz et al. and is based on the recently introduced notion of smooth projective hashing by Cramer and Shoup. We gain a number of benefits from this abstraction. First, we obtain a modular protocol that can be described using just three high-level cryptographic tools. This allows a simple and intuitive understanding of its security. Second, our proof of security is significantly simpler and more modular. Third, we are able to derive analogs to the Katz et al. protocol under additional cryptographic assumptions. Specifically, in addition to the DDH assumption used by Katz et al., we obtain protocols under both the quadratic andN-residuosity assumptions. In order to achieve this, we construct new smooth projective hash functions.", "authors": [{"name": "rosario gennaro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100556240"}, {"name": "yehuda lindell", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100595891"}], "title": "A framework for password-based authenticated key exchange1", "citations": [{"Name": "Rainer Steinwandt ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Vikt\u00f3ria I.

While the mechanics of certifying and revoking public keys and escrowing and recovering private keys have been widely explored, less attention has been paid to access control frameworks for regulating access to stored keys by different parties. In this article we propose such a framework for a key management service that supports public key registration, lookup, and revocation, and private key escrow, protected use (e.g., to decrypt selected messages), and recovery. We propose an access control model using a policy based on principal, ownership, and authority relationships on keys. The model allows owners to grant to others (and revoke) privileges to execute various actions on their keys. The simple authorization language is very expressive, enabling the specification of authorizations for composite subjects that can be fully specified (ground) or partially specified, thus making the authorizations applicable to all subjects satisfying some conditions. We illustrate how the access control policy and the authorizations can easily be expressed through a simple and restricted, hence efficiently computable, form of logic language.", "authors": [{"name": "pierangela samarati", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100191823"}, {"name": "michael k reiter", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81387594159"}, {"name": "sushil jajodia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100609407"}], "title": "An authorization model for a public key management service", "citations": [{"Name": "Seng-Phil Hong ", "Country": "greece", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sungmin Kang", "Country": "greece", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chang N.

However, abstraction is an error-prone process and is not well supported in current intrusion-detection systems (IDSs). This article presents a hierarchical model to support attack specification and event abstraction in distributed intrusion detection. The model involves three concepts:system view,signature, andview definition. A system view provides an abstract interface of a particular type of information; defined on the instances of system views, a signature specifies certain distributed attacks or events to be monitored; a view definition is then used to derive information from the matches of a signature and presents it through a system view. With the three elements, the model provides a hierarchical framework for maintaining signatures, system views, as well as event abstraction. As a benefit, the model allows generic signatures that can accommodate unknown variants of known attacks. Moreover, abstraction represented by a system view can be updated without changing either its specification or the signatures specified on its basis. This article then presents a decentralized method for autonomous but cooperative component systems to detect distributed attacks specified by signatures. Specifically, a signature is decomposed into finer units, calleddetection tasks, each of which represents the activity to be monitored on a component system. The component systems (involved in a signature) then perform the detection tasks cooperatively according to the \"dependency\" relationships among these tasks. An experimental system calledCARDShas been implemented to test the feasibility of the proposed approach.", "authors": [{"name": "peng ning", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332518403"}, {"name": "sushil jajodia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100609407"}, {"name": "xiaoyang sean wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81423593091"}], "title": "Abstraction-based intrusion detection in distributed environments", "citations": [{"Name": "Daniel Apon ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jonathan Katz ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alex J.

The major problem is that concurrency control mechanisms used in traditional DBMSs are not adequate in a MLS/DBMS, since they may be exploited to establish covert channels. The approach presented in this article, which uses single-version data items, is based on the use of nested transactions, application-level recovery, and notification-based locking protocols. All these features allow us to develop a concurrency control mechanism that is free of timing channels and avoids many of the shortcomings of the concurrency control mechanisms so far developed for conventional (i.e., flat) transactions, such as transaction starvation and resource wastage.", "authors": [{"name": "elisa bertino", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409594658"}, {"name": "barbara catania", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100298950"}, {"name": "elena ferrari", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339498938"}], "title": "A nested transaction model for multilevel secure database management systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Dominic Duggan ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ye Wu", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "S.

However, the development of such protocols is itself difficult, and prior systems have exhibited high overheads, primarily due to the cost of digital signatures. The SecureRing group communication system provides secure, reliable, totally-ordered message delivery and group membership services despite the malicious corruption of a constant fraction of the processors within the system. The network is assumed not to partition, and persistent communication faults are handled as processor faults. The SecureRing message delivery protocol makes use of message digests in a signed token to allow a single digital signature to cover multiple messages, and to avoid the need for multiple rounds of message exchange in normal operation. While these techniques mean that messages are not authenticated in real time, they enable the SecureRing protocols to achieve high throughput and reasonable latency.", "authors": [{"name": "kim potter kihlstrom", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100329614"}, {"name": "l e moser", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100361472"}, {"name": "p m melliar-smith", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100149976"}], "title": "The SecureRing group communication system", "citations": [{"Name": "Michael Abd-El-Malek ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gregory R.

Over the span os seven years, the project was transformed into an effort to develop and deploy a product: the Standard Mail Guard (SMG). Since the project took place under a US government contract, the development team needed to maintain detailed records of the time spent on the project. The records from 1987 to 1992 have been combined with information about software code size and error detection. This information has been used to examine the practical impacts of high assurance techniques on a large-scale software development program. Tasks are associated with the A1 formal assurance requirements added approximately 58% to the development cost of security-critical software. In exchange for these costs, the formal assurance tasks (formal specifications, proofs, and specification code correspondence) uncovered 68% of the security flaws detected in LOCK's critical security mechanisms. However, a study of flaw detection during the SMG program found that only 14% of all flaws detected were of the type that could be detected using formal assurance, and that the work of the formal assusrance team only accounted for 19% of all flaws detected. While formal assurance is clearly effective at detecting flaws, its practicality hinges on the degree to which the formally modeled system properties represent all of a system's esential properties.", "authors": [{"name": "richard e smith", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100078968"}], "title": "Cost profile of a highly assured, secure operating system", "citations": [{"Name": "Stephen D.

This model includes three layers: adata process layerto parse packets and dispatch data; andevent abstractorto abstract predefined real-time events for the link-state routing protocol; and anextended timed finite state machineto express the real-time behavior of the protocol engine and to detect intrusions by pattern matching. The timed FSM, called theJiNao Finite State Machine(JFSM) is extended from the conventional FSM with timed states, multiple timers, and time constraints on state transitions. The JFSM is implemented as a generator that can create and FSM by constructing the configuration file only. The results show that this approach is very effective for detecting real-time intrusions. Our approach can be extended for use in other network protocol intrusion-detection systems, especially for those with known attacks.", "authors": [{"name": "ho-yen chang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81545857356"}, {"name": "s felix wu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452594279"}, {"name": "y frank jou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81547091456"}], "title": "Real-time protocol analysis for detecting link-state routing protocol attacks", "citations": [{"Name": "Dijiang Huang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Qing Cao ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Amit Sinha ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marc J.

Hence we were motivated by the need to manage and enforce the strong and efficient RBAC access control technology in large-scale Web environments. To satisfy this requirement, we identify two different architectures for RBAC on the Web, calleduser-pullandserver-pull. To demonstrate feasibility, we implement each architecture by integrating and extending well-known technologies such as cookies, X.509, SSL, and LDAP, providing compatibility with current web technologies. We describe the technologies we use to implement RBAC on the Web in different architectures. Based on our experience, we also compare the tradeoffs of the different approaches.", "authors": [{"name": "joon s park", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452601292"}, {"name": "ravi sandhu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81312485832"}, {"name": "gail-joon ahn", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375604762"}], "title": "Role-based access control on the web", "citations": [{"Name": "Mohammad A.

Roles may be available to users at certain time periods, and unavailable at others. Moreover, there can be temporal dependencies among roles. To tackle such dynamic aspects, we introduce Temporal-RBAC (TRBAC), an extension of the RBAC model. TRBAC supports periodic role enabling and disabling---possibly with individual exceptions for particular users---and temporal dependencies among such actions, expressed by means of role triggers. Role trigger actions may be either immediately executed, or deferred by an explicitly specified amount of time. Enabling and disabling actions may be given a priority, which is used to solve conflicting actions. A formal semantics for the specification language is provided, and a polynomial safeness check is introduced to reject ambiguous or inconsistent specifications. Finally, a system implementing TRBAC on top of a conventional DBMS is presented.", "authors": [{"name": "elisa bertino", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409594658"}, {"name": "piero andrea bonatti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100065041"}, {"name": "elena ferrari", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339498938"}], "title": "TRBAC: A temporal role-based access control model", "citations": [{"Name": "Elisa Bertino", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Qun Ni ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Elisa Bertino", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Basit Shafiq ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jaideep S.

Although RBAC models have received broad support as a generalized approach to access control, and are well recognized for their many advantages in performing large-scale authorization management, no single authoritative definition of RBAC exists today. This lack of a widely accepted model results in uncertainty and confusion about RBAC's utility and meaning. The standard proposed here seeks to resolve this situation by unifying ideas from a base of frequently referenced RBAC models, commercial products, and research prototypes. It is intended to serve as a foundation for product development, evaluation, and procurement specification. Although RBAC continues to evolve as users, researchers, and vendors gain experience with its application, we feel the features and components proposed in this standard represent a fundamental and stable set of mechanisms that may be enhanced by developers in further meeting the needs of their customers. As such, this document does not attempt to standardize RBAC features beyond those that have achieved acceptance in the commercial marketplace and research community, but instead focuses on defining a fundamental and stable set of RBAC components. This standard is organized into the RBAC Reference Model and the RBAC System and Administrative Functional Specification. The reference model defines the scope of features that comprise the standard and provides a consistent vocabulary in support of the specification. The RBAC System and Administrative Functional Specification defines functional requirements for administrative operations and queries for the creation, maintenance, and review of RBAC sets and relations, as well as for specifying system level functionality in support of session attribute management and an access control decision process.", "authors": [{"name": "david f ferraiolo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100382189"}, {"name": "ravi sandhu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81312485832"}, {"name": "serban gavrila", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100077535"}, {"name": "d richard kuhn", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100443881"}, {"name": "ramaswamy chandramouli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100325801"}], "title": "Proposed NIST standard for role-based access control", "citations": [{"Name": "Halvard Skogsrud ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Boualem Benatallah ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fabio Casati ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Manh Q.

It has been proven that the safety of an access control configuration cannot be decided for a general access control model, such as Lampson's access matrix, so safety is achieved either through the use of limited access control models or the verification of safety via constraints. Currently, almost all safety critical systems use limited access control models, such as Bell--LaPadula or Domain and Type Enforcement, because constraint expression languages are far too complex for typical administrators to use properly. However, researchers have identified that most constraints belong to one of a few basic types, so our goal is to develop a constraint expression model in which these constraints can be expressed in a straightforward way and extensions can be made to add other constraints, if desired. Our approach to expressing constraints has the following properties: (1) an access control policy is expressed using a graphical model in which the nodes represent sets (e.g., of subjects, objects, etc.) and the edges represent binary relationships on those sets and (2) constraints are expressed using a few, simple set operators on graph nodes. The basic graphical model is very simple, and we extend this model only as necessary to satisfy the identified constraint types. Since the basic graphical model is also general, further extension to support other constraints is possible, but such extensions should be made with caution as each increases the complexity of the model. Our hope is that by keeping the complexity of constraint expression in check, flexible access control models, such as role-based access control, may also be used for expressing access control policy for safety-critical systems.", "authors": [{"name": "trent jaeger", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100654847"}, {"name": "jonathon e tidswell", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100325019"}], "title": "Practical safety in flexible access control models", "citations": [{"Name": "Manuel Koch ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Luigi V.

A network covert channel operates by altering the timing of otherwise legitimate network traffic so that the arrival times of packets encode confidential data that an attacker wants to exfiltrate from a secure area from which she has no other means of communication. In this article, we present the first public implementation of an IP covert channel, discuss the subtle issues that arose in its design, and present a discussion on its efficacy. We then show that an IP covert channel can be differentiated from legitimate channels and present new detection measures that provide detection rates over 95&percnt;. We next take the simple step an attacker would of adding noise to the channel to attempt to conceal the covert communication. For these noisy IP covert timing channels, we show that our online detection measures can fail to identify the covert channel for noise levels higher than 10&percnt;. We then provide effective offline search mechanisms that identify the noisy channels.", "authors": [{"name": "serdar cabuk", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100105440"}, {"name": "carla e brodley", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100347793"}, {"name": "clay shields", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100527773"}], "title": "IP Covert Channel Detection", "citations": [{"Name": "H.

Such policies require an access control system to be resilient to the absence of users. An example resiliency policy requires that upon removal of anysusers, there should still existddisjoint sets of users such that the users in each set together possess certain permissions of interest. Such a policy ensures that even when emergency situations cause some users to be absent, there still exist independent teams of users that have the permissions necessary for carrying out critical tasks. The Resiliency Checking Problem determines whether an access control state satisfies a given resiliency policy. We show that the general case of the problem and several subcases are intractable (NP-hard), and identify two subcases that are solvable in linear time. For the intractable cases, we also identify the complexity class in the polynomial hierarchy to which these problems belong. We discuss the design and evaluation of an algorithm that can efficiently solve instances of nontrivial sizes that belong to the intractable cases of the problem. Furthermore, we study the consistency problem between resiliency policies and static separation of duty policies. Finally, we combine the notions of resiliency and separation of duty to introduce the resilient separation of duty policy, which is useful in situations where both fault-tolerance and fraud-prevention are desired.", "authors": [{"name": "ninghui li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100475364"}, {"name": "qihua wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319503861"}, {"name": "mahesh tripunitara", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100295811"}], "title": "Resiliency Policies in Access Control", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "22\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "768\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "purdue university", "city": null, "Name": "ninghui li"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "purdue university", "city": null, "Name": "qihua wang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "motorola labs", "city": null, "Name": "mahesh tripunitara"}]}, "Article No.: 21": {"references": ["Anderson, R.2000.

At the same time, the acutely restricted and cost-sensitive nature of RFID tags rules out simple reuse of traditional security/privacy solutions and calls for a new generation of extremely lightweight identification and authentication protocols.This article describes a universally composable security framework designed especially for RFID applications. We adopt RFID-specific setup, communication, and concurrency assumptions in a model that guarantees strong security, privacy, and availability properties. In particular, the framework supports modular deployment, which is most appropriate for ubiquitous applications. We also describe a set of simple, efficient, secure, and anonymous (untraceable) RFID identification and authentication protocols that instantiate the proposed framework. These protocols involve minimal interaction between tags and readers and place only a small computational load on the tag, and a light computational burden on the back-end server. We show that our protocols are provably secure within the proposed framework.", "authors": [{"name": "mike burmester", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100375673"}, {"name": "tri van le", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81430592795"}, {"name": "breno de medeiros", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100421235"}, {"name": "gene tsudik", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100064107"}], "title": "Universally Composable RFID Identification and Authentication Protocols", "citations": [{"Name": "Dang Nguyen Duc ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Divyan M.

First, we introduce a new primitive that we callordered multisignature(OMS) scheme, which allows signers to attest to a common message as well as the order in which they signed. Our OMS construction substantially improves computational efficiency and scalability over any existing scheme with suitable functionality. Second, we design a new identity-based sequential aggregate signature scheme, where signers can attest to different messages and signature verification does not require knowledge of traditional public keys. The latter property permits savings on bandwidth and storage as compared to public-key solutions. In contrast to the only prior scheme to provide this functionality, ours offers improved security that does not rely on synchronized clocks or a trusted first signer. We provide formal security definitions and support the proposed schemes with security proofs under appropriate computational assumptions. We focus on applications of our schemes to secure network routing, but we believe that they will find other applications as well.", "authors": [{"name": "alexandra boldyreva", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100411349"}, {"name": "craig gentry", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81340489302"}, {"name": "adam oneill", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384598731"}, {"name": "dae hyun yum", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100140143"}], "title": "New Multiparty Signature Schemes for Network Routing Applications", "citations": [{"Name": "S.

In recent years, a number of schemes have been proposed to solve this problem, assuming either no or limited trust between the nodes prior to their deployment. Despite numerous proposals, there is no common understanding of the proposed schemes and of the trade-offs that they provide. This has consequences for both researchers and practitioners, who do not have a clear idea how to compare the schemes and how to select a scheme for a given application. In this article, we present a framework that helps in understanding and comparing schemes for secure bootstrapping of MANETs. The framework is general because it is policy-neutral and can accommodate many existing bootstrapping schemes. The proposed framework can equally serve as a good basis for the development of new MANET bootstrapping schemes; we show how the development of the framework leads to two new (classes of) distributed bootstrapping schemes. Within the framework, we not only investigate and characterize the properties of the relevant bootstrapping schemes, but also give methods for practitioners to select the relevant system parameters in the Random Walk and the (Restricted) Random Waypoint mobility models.", "authors": [{"name": "shouhuai xu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384596616"}, {"name": "srdjan capkun", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100396056"}], "title": "Distributed and Secure Bootstrapping of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks: Framework and Constructions", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "30\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "708\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of texas", "city": null, "Name": "shouhuai xu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "eth zurich", "city": null, "Name": "srdjan capkun"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["Mart\u00edn Abadi , Michael Burrows , Butler Lampson , Gordon Plotkin, A calculus for access control in distributed systems, ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems (TOPLAS), v.15 n.4, p.706-734, Sept. 1993[doi>10.1145/155183.155225]\n", "Grigoris Antoniou , Frank vanHarmelen, A Semantic Web Primer, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 2004\n", "Krzysztof R.

In the distributed case, standard RBAC assumptions (e.g., of relatively static access policies, managed by human users, with complete information available about users and job functions) do not necessarily apply. Moreover, RBAC is restricted in the sense that it is based on one type of ascribed status, an assignment of a user to a role. In this article, we introduce the status-based access control (SBAC) model for distributed access control. The SBAC model (or family of models) is based on the notion of users having an action status as well as an ascribed status. A user's action status is established, in part, from a history of events that relate to the user; this history enables changing access policy requirements to be naturally accommodated. The approach can be implemented as an autonomous agent that reasons about the events, actions, and a history (of events and actions), which relates to a requester for access to resources, in order to decide whether the requester is permitted the access sought. We define a number of algebras for composing SBAC policies, algebras that exploit the language that we introduce for SBAC policy representation: identification-based logic programs. The SBAC model is richer than RBAC models and the policies that can be represented in our approach are more expressive than the policies admitted by a number of monotonic languages that have been hitherto described for representing distributed access control requirements. Our algebras generalize existing algebras that have been defined for access policy composition. We also describe an approach for the efficient implementation of SBAC policies.", "authors": [{"name": "steve barker", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100376938"}, {"name": "marek j sergot", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100363824"}, {"name": "duminda wijesekera", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100523578"}], "title": "Status-Based Access Control", "citations": [{"Name": "Paolo Mancarella ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Francesca Toni", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Semi-negative abductive logic programs with implicative integrity constraints: semantics and properties", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Logic Programs", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Norms and Action: essays in honor of Marek J.

Roughly speaking, one agent maintains secrecy with respect to another if the second agent cannot rule out any possibilities for the behavior or state of the first agent. We show that the framework can handle probability and nondeterminism in a clean way, is useful for reasoning about asynchronous systems as well as synchronous systems, and suggests generalizations of secrecy that may be useful for dealing with issues such as resource-bounded reasoning. We also show that a number of well-known attempts to characterize the absence of information flow are special cases of our definitions of secrecy.", "authors": [{"name": "joseph y halpern", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100537160"}, {"name": "kevin r oneill", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81316490034"}], "title": "Secrecy in Multiagent Systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Aaron Bohannon ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Benjamin C.

Specifically, Bob values each credential with a certain number of points, and requires a minimum total threshold of points before granting Alice access to a resource. In turn, Alice values each of her credentials with a privacy score that indicates her degree of reluctance to reveal that credential. Bob's valuation of credentials and his threshold are private. Alice's privacy-valuation of her credentials is also private. Alice wants to find a subset of her credentials that achieves Bob's required threshold for access, yet is of as small a value to her as possible. We give protocols for computing such a subset of Alice's credentials without revealing any of the two parties' above-mentioned private information. Furthermore, we develop a fingerprint method that allows Alice to independently and easily recover the optimal knapsack solution, once the computed optimal value is given, but also enables verification of the integrity of the optimal value. The fingerprint method is useful beyond the specific authorization problem studied, and can be applied to any integer knapsack dynamic programming in a private setting.", "authors": [{"name": "danfeng yao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452593442"}, {"name": "keith b frikken", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100394588"}, {"name": "mikhail j atallah", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100355888"}, {"name": "roberto tamassia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100005178"}], "title": "Private Information: To Reveal or not to Reveal", "citations": [{"Name": "Claudio A.

Central to our approach is the evidence graph model that facilitates evidence presentation and automated reasoning. Based on the evidence graph, we propose a hierarchical reasoning framework that consists of two levels. Local reasoning aims to infer the functional states of network entities from local observations. Global reasoning aims to identify important entities from the graph structure and extract groups of densely correlated participants in the attack scenario. This article also presents a framework for interactive hypothesis testing, which helps to identify the attacker's nonexplicit attack activities from secondary evidence. We developed a prototype system that implements the techniques discussed. Experimental results on various attack datasets demonstrate that our analysis mechanism achieves good coverage and accuracy in attack group and scenario extraction with less dependence on hard-coded expert knowledge.", "authors": [{"name": "wei wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81423592797"}, {"name": "thomas e daniels", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100401823"}], "title": "A Graph Based Approach Toward Network Forensics Analysis", "citations": [{"Name": "Anoop Singhal ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Changwei Liu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Duminda Wijesekara", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Li Ming Chen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Meng Chang Chen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wanjiun Liao ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yeali S.

Whenever a program monitor detects that untrusted software is attempting to execute a dangerous action, it takes remedial steps to ensure that only safe code actually gets executed.This article improves our understanding of the space of policies enforceable by monitoring the run-time behaviors of programs. We begin by building a formal framework for analyzing policy enforcement: we precisely define policies, monitors, and enforcement. This framework allows us to prove that monitors enforce an interesting set of policies that we call the infinite renewal properties. We show how to construct a program monitor that provably enforces any reasonable infinite renewal property. We also show that the set of infinite renewal properties includes some nonsafety policies, that is, that monitors can enforce some nonsafety (including some purely liveness) policies. Finally, we demonstrate concrete examples of nonsafety policies enforceable by practical run-time monitors.", "authors": [{"name": "jay ligatti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413595146"}, {"name": "lujo bauer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350570444"}, {"name": "david walker", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100426485"}], "title": "Run-Time Enforcement of Nonsafety Policies", "citations": [{"Name": "Yli\u00e8s Falcone ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Laurent Mounier ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jean-Claude Fernandez ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jean-Luc Richier", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nataliia Bielova ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fabio Massacci ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andrea Micheletti", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Towards Practical Enforcement Theories", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alireza Sharifi ", "Country": "netherlands", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mahesh V.

A key property of our SEE is that it faithfully reproduces the behavior of applications, as if they were running natively on the underlying (host) operating system. This is accomplished viaone-way isolation:processes running within the SEE are given read-access to the environment provided by the host OS, but their write operations are prevented from escaping outside the SEE. As a result, SEE processes cannot impact the behavior of host OS processes, or the integrity of data on the host OS. SEEs support a wide range of tasks, including: study of malicious code, controlled execution of untrusted software, experimentation with software configuration changes, testing of software patches, and so on. It provides a convenient way for users to inspect system changes made within the SEE. If these changes are not accepted, they can be rolled back at the click of a button. Otherwise, the changes can be committed so as to become visible outside the SEE. We provide consistency criteria that ensure semantic consistency of the committed results. We develop two different implementation approaches, one inuser-landand the other in theOS kernel, for realizing a safe-execution environment. Our implementation results show that most software, including fairly complex server and client applications, can run successfully within our SEEs. It introduces low performance overheads, typically below 10 percent.", "authors": [{"name": "zhenkai liang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350590450"}, {"name": "weiqing sun", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81392607322"}, {"name": "v n venkatakrishnan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319503212"}, {"name": "r sekar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100540236"}], "title": "Alcatraz: An Isolated Environment for Experimenting with Untrusted Software", "citations": [{"Name": "Yongzheng Wu ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Roland H.

A user with access privileges for a class obtains access to objects stored at that class and all descendant classes in the hierarchy. The problem of key management for such hierarchies then consists of assigning a key to each class in the hierarchy so that keys for descendant classes can be obtained via efficient key derivation.We propose a solution to this problem with the following properties: (1) the space complexity of the public information is the same as that of storing the hierarchy; (2) the private information at a class consists of a single key associated with that class; (3) updates (i.e., revocations and additions) are handledlocallyin the hierarchy; (4) the scheme is provably secure against collusion; and (5) each node can derive the key of any of its descendant with a number of symmetric-key operations bounded by the length of the path between the nodes. Whereas many previous schemes had some of these properties, ours is the first that satisfies all of them. The security of our scheme is based on pseudorandom functions, without reliance on the Random Oracle Model.Another substantial contribution of this work is that we are able to lower the key derivation time at the expense of modestly increasing the public storage associated with the hierarchy. Insertion of additional, so-called shortcut, edges, allows to lower the key derivation to a small constant number of steps for graphs that are total orders and trees by increasing the total number of edges by a small asymptotic factor such asO(log*n) for ann-node hierarchy. For more general access hierarchies of dimensiond, we use a technique that consists of adding dummy nodes and dimension reduction. The key derivation work for such graphs is then linear indand the increase in the number of edges is by the factorO(logd\u2009\u2212\u20091n) compared to the one-dimensional case.Finally, by making simple modifications to our scheme, we show how to handle extensions proposed by Crampton [2003] of the standard hierarchies to \u201climited depth\u201d and reverse inheritance.", "authors": [{"name": "mikhail j atallah", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100355888"}, {"name": "marina blanton", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100425073"}, {"name": "nelly fazio", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100489423"}, {"name": "keith b frikken", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100394588"}], "title": "Dynamic and Efficient Key Management for Access Hierarchies", "citations": [{"Name": "Yi-Ruei Chen ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Cheng-Kang Chu ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wen-Guey Tzeng ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jianying Zhou", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lei Wei ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Scott E.

The server uses the query on a stream of documents and returns the matching documents to the client while learning nothing about the nature of the query. We present a new scheme for conducting private keyword search on streaming data which requiresO(m) server to client communication complexity to return the content of the matching documents, wheremis an upper bound on the size of the documents. The required storage on the server conducting the search is alsoO(m). The previous best scheme for private stream searching was shown to haveO(mlogm) communication and storage complexity. Our solution employs a novel construction in which the user reconstructs the matching files by solving a system of linear equations. This allows the matching documents to be stored in a compact buffer rather than relying on redundancies to avoid collisions in the storage buffer as in previous work. This technique requires a small amount of metadata to be returned in addition to the documents; for this the original scheme of Ostrovsky and Skeith may be employed withO(mlogm) communication and storage complexity. We also present an alternative method for returning the necessary metadata based on a unique encrypted Bloom filter construction. This method requiresO(mlog(t/m)) communication and storage complexity, wheretis the number of documents in the stream. In this article we describe our scheme, prove it secure, analyze its asymptotic performance, and describe a number of extensions. We also provide an experimental analysis of its scalability in practice. Specifically, we consider its performance in the demanding scenario of providing a privacy preserving version of the Google News Alerts service.", "authors": [{"name": "john bethencourt", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331488592"}, {"name": "dawn song", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100578951"}, {"name": "brent waters", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319503857"}], "title": "New Techniques for Private Stream Searching", "citations": [{"Name": "Shlomi Dolev ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Niv Gilboa ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ximing Li", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michael Oehler ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dhananjay S.

Notably, security-related algorithms on Web servers and other network servers need to be carefully engineered to avoid timing channel leaks at the accuracy demonstrated in this article.", "authors": [{"name": "scott a crosby", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100255678"}, {"name": "dan s wallach", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100639714"}, {"name": "rudolf h riedi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332523361"}], "title": "Opportunities and Limits of Remote Timing Attacks", "citations": [{"Name": "Caisen Chen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tao Wang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Junjian Tian", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Improving timing attack on RSA-CRT via error detection and correction strategy", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Isabell Schmitt ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sebastian Schinzel", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andreas Haeberlen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Benjamin C.

These attributes may be obtained through interactions with any number of external entities and are collected and validated over an extended period of time. Although these collections of credentials in some ways resemble partial system snapshots, current trust negotiation and distributed proving systems lack the notion of a consistent global state in which the satisfaction of authorization policies should be checked. In this article, we argue that unlike the notions of consistency studied in other areas of distributed computing, the level of consistency required during policy evaluation is predicated solely upon the security requirements of the policy evaluator. As such, there is little incentive for entities to participate in complicated consistency preservation schemes like those used in distributed computing, distributed databases, and distributed shared memory. We go on to show that the most intuitive notion of consistency fails to provide basic safety guarantees under certain circumstances and then propose several more refined notions of consistency that provide stronger safety guarantees. We provide algorithms that allow each of these refined notions of consistency to be attained in practice with minimal overheads and formally prove several security and privacy properties of these algorithms. Lastly, we explore the notion of strategic design trade-offs in the consistency enforcement algorithm space and propose several modifications to the core algorithms presented in this article. These modifications enhance the privacy-preservation or completeness properties of these algorithms without altering the consistency constraints that they enforce.", "authors": [{"name": "adam j lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100385390"}, {"name": "marianne winslett", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100471278"}], "title": "Enforcing Safety and Consistency Constraints in Policy-Based Authorization Systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Claire Vishik ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Anand Rajan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chris Ramming ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "David Grawrock ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jesse Walker", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Adam J.

Instead of running code on manually or randomly constructed input, EXE runs it on symbolic input initially allowed to be anything. As checked code runs, EXE tracks the constraints on each symbolic (i.e., input-derived) memory location. If a statement uses a symbolic value, EXE does not run it, but instead adds it as an input-constraint; all other statements run as usual. If code conditionally checks a symbolic expression, EXE forks execution, constraining the expression to be true on the true branch and false on the other. Because EXE reasons about all possible values on a path, it has much more power than a traditional runtime tool: (1) it can force execution down any feasible program path and (2) at dangerous operations (e.g., a pointer dereference), it detects if the current path constraints allowanyvalue that causes a bug. When a path terminates or hits a bug, EXE automatically generates a test case by solving the current path constraints to find concrete values using its own co-designed constraint solver, STP. Because EXE\u2019s constraints have no approximations, feeding this concrete input to an uninstrumented version of the checked code will cause it to follow the same path and hit the same bug (assuming deterministic code).EXE works well on real code, finding bugs along with inputs that trigger them in: the BSD and Linux packet filter implementations, the dhcpd DHCP server, the pcre regular expression library, and three Linux file systems.", "authors": [{"name": "cristian cadar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100235414"}, {"name": "vijay ganesh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100181845"}, {"name": "peter m pawlowski", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81405592035"}, {"name": "david l dill", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100342748"}, {"name": "dawson r engler", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100222430"}], "title": "EXE: Automatically Generating Inputs of Death", "citations": [{"Name": "Nicholas Kidd ", "Country": "netherlands", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Suresh Jagannathan ", "Country": "netherlands", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jan Vitek", "Country": "netherlands", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Corina S.

In this paper we attempt to quantify the threat of browsers being indirectly misused for attacking third parties. Specifically, we look at how the existing Web infrastructure (e.g., the languages, protocols, and security policies) can be exploited by malicious or subverted Web sites to remotely instruct browsers to orchestrate actions including denial of service attacks, worm propagation, and reconnaissance scans. We show that attackers are able to create powerful botnet-like infrastructures that can cause significant damage. We explore the effectiveness of countermeasures including anomaly detection and more fine-grained browser security policies.", "authors": [{"name": "spiros antonatos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310482051"}, {"name": "periklis akritidis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309500767"}, {"name": "vinh the lam", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350599341"}, {"name": "kostas g anagnostakis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100626434"}], "title": "Puppetnets: Misusing Web Browsers as a Distributed Attack Infrastructure", "citations": [{"Name": "Yossi Gilad ", "Country": "brazil", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Amir Herzberg", "Country": "brazil", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yossi Gilad ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Amir Herzberg", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "40\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "1082\n", "Citation Count": "8\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "spiros antonatos"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "periklis akritidiscambridge university"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "vinh the lamuniversity of california"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "kostas g anagnostakis"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["Mauro Andreolini , Alessandro Bulgarelli , Michele Colajanni , Francesca Mazzoni, HoneySpam: honeypots fighting spam at the source, Proceedings of the Steps to Reducing Unwanted Traffic on the Internet on Steps to Reducing Unwanted Traffic on the Internet Workshop, p.11-11, July 07, 2005, Cambridge, MA\n", "B\u00e4cher, P., Holz, T., K\u00f6tter, M., and Wicherski, G.2005.

Spammers have plagued the Internet by exploiting a large number of spam proxies. The facility of breaking spam laundering and deterring spamming activities close to their sources, which would greatly benefit not only e-mail users but also victim ISPs, is in great demand but still missing. In this article, we reveal one salient characteristic of proxy-based spamming activities, namely packet symmetry, by analyzing protocol semantics and timing causality. Based on the packet symmetry exhibited in spam laundering, we propose a simple and effective technique, DBSpam, to online detect and break spam laundering activities inside a customer network. Monitoring the bidirectional traffic passing through a network gateway, DBSpam utilizes a simple statistical method, Sequential Probability Ratio Test, to detect the occurrence of spam laundering in a timely manner. To balance the goals of promptness and accuracy, we introduce a noise-reduction technique in DBSpam, after which the laundering path can be identified more accurately. Then DBSpam activates its spam suppressing mechanism to break the spam laundering. We implement a prototype of DBSpam based onlibpcap, and validate its efficacy on spam detection and suppression through both theoretical analyses and trace-based experiments.", "authors": [{"name": "mengjun xie", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319504473"}, {"name": "heng yin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319505250"}, {"name": "haining wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451599572"}], "title": "Thwarting E-mail Spam Laundering", "citations": [{"Name": "Pedro H.

Inspired by this idea, we propose apacket vaccinemechanism that randomizes address-like strings in packet payloads to carry out fast exploit detection and signature generation. An exploit with a randomized jump address behaves like a vaccine: it will likely cause an exception in a vulnerable program\u2019s process when attempting to hijack the control flow, and thereby expose itself. Taking that exploit as a template, our signature generator creates a set of new vaccines to probe the program in an attempt to uncover the necessary conditions for the exploit to happen. A signature is built upon these conditions to shield the underlying vulnerability from further attacks. In this way, packet vaccine detects exploits and generates signatures in a black-box fashion, that is, not relying on the knowledge of a vulnerable program\u2019s source and binary code. Therefore, it even works on the commodity software obfuscated for the purpose of copyright protection. In addition, since our approach avoids the expense of tracking the program\u2019s execution flow, it performs almost as fast as a normal run of the program and is capable of generating a signature of high quality within seconds or even subseconds. We present the design of the packet vaccine mechanism and an example of its application. We also describe our proof-of-concept implementation and the evaluation of our technique using real exploits.", "authors": [{"name": "xiaofeng wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81372591949"}, {"name": "zhuowei li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319496349"}, {"name": "jong youl choi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100481093"}, {"name": "jun xu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451593688"}, {"name": "michael k reiter", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81387594159"}, {"name": "chongkyung kil", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309497958"}], "title": "Fast and Black-box Exploit Detection and Signature Generation for Commodity Software", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "32\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "728\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "india", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "indiana university", "city": null, "Name": "xiaofeng wang"}, {"country": "india", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "indiana university", "city": null, "Name": "zhuowei li"}, {"country": "india", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "indiana university", "city": null, "Name": "jong youl choi"}, {"country": "Hong Kong", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "google inc and north carolina state university", "city": "north", "Name": "jun xu"}, {"country": "Hong Kong", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of north carolina at chapel hill", "city": "north", "Name": "michael k reiter"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["Rakesh Agrawal , Peter J.

In R2BAC, in addition to a user\u2019s role memberships, the user\u2019s relationships with other users help determine whether the user is allowed to perform a certain step in a workflow. For example, a constraint may require that two steps must not be performed by users who have conflicts of interests. We study computational complexity of the workflow satisfiability problem, which asks whether a set of users can complete a workflow. In particular, we apply tools from parameterized complexity theory to better understand the complexities of this problem. Furthermore, we reduce the workflow satisfiability problem to SAT and apply SAT solvers to address the problem. Experiments show that our algorithm can solve instances of reasonable size efficiently. Finally, it is sometimes not enough to ensure that a workflow can be completed in normal situations. We study the resiliency problem in workflow authorization systems, which asks whether a workflow can be completed even if a number of users may be absent. We formally define three levels of resiliency in workflow systems and study computational problems related to these notions of resiliency.", "authors": [{"name": "qihua wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319503861"}, {"name": "ninghui li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100475364"}], "title": "Satisfiability and Resiliency in Workflow Authorization Systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Ligang He ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nadeem Chaudhary ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Stephen A.

MPSS providesmobility: The group of nodes holding the shares of the secret can change at each resharing, which is essential in a long-lived system. MPSS additionally allows the number of tolerated faulty shareholders to change when the secret is moved so that the system can tolerate more (or fewer) corruptions; this allows reconfiguration on-the-fly to accommodate changes in the environment.MPSS includes an efficient protocol that is intended to be used in practice. The protocol is optimized for the common case of no or few failures, but degradation when there are more failures is modest. MPSS contains a step in which nodes accuse proposals made by other nodes; we show a novel way to handle these accusations when their verity cannot be known. We also present a way to produce accusations that can be verified without releasing keys of other nodes; verifiable accusations improve the performance of MPSS, and are a useful primitive independent of MPSS.", "authors": [{"name": "david schultz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367598394"}, {"name": "barbara liskov", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100323833"}, {"name": "moses liskov", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100322663"}], "title": "MPSS: Mobile Proactive Secret Sharing", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "39\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "445\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "massachusetts institute of technology", "city": null, "Name": "david schultz"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "massachusetts institute of technology", "city": null, "Name": "barbara liskov"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the mitre corporation", "city": null, "Name": "moses liskov"}]}, "Article No.: 33": {"references": ["Mihir Bellare , Chanathip Namprempre, Authenticated Encryption: Relations among Notions and Analysis of the Generic Composition Paradigm, Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on the Theory and Application of Cryptology and Information Security: Advances in Cryptology, p.531-545, December 03-07, 2000\n", "John Black , Phillip Rogaway, A Block-Cipher Mode of Operation for Parallelizable Message Authentication, Proceedings of the International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques: Advances in Cryptology, p.384-397, May 02, 2002\n", "D.

To simplify the integration of these primitives into standard security architectures, Boyen et al. [2006] recently introduced the concept of forward-secure signatures with untrusted updates where private keys are additionally protected by a second factor (derived from a password). Key updates can be made on encrypted version of signing keys so that passwords only come into play for signing messages and not at update time (since update is not user-driven). The scheme put forth by Boyen et al. relies on bilinear maps and does not require the random oracle. They also suggest the integration of untrusted updates in the Bellare-Miner forward-secure signature. Their work left open the problem of endowing other existing FSS systems with the same second factor protection, and a natural second question is whether the method can apply to other key-evolving paradigms. This article solves the first problem by showing an efficient generic construction that does not require to set a bound on the number of time periods at key generation.

Since VoIP calls may traverse untrusted networks, packets should be encrypted to ensure confidentiality. However, we show that it is possible toidentify the phrases spoken within encrypted VoIP callswhen the audio is encoded using variable bit rate codecs. To do so, we train a hidden Markov model using only knowledge of the phonetic pronunciations of words, such as those provided by a dictionary, and search packet sequences for instances of specified phrases. Our approach does not require examples of the speaker\u2019s voice, or even example recordings of the words that make up the target phrase. We evaluate our techniques on a standard speech recognition corpus containing over 2,000 phonetically rich phrases spoken by 630 distinct speakers from across the continental United States. Our results indicate that we can identify phrases within encrypted calls with an average accuracy of 50&percnt;, and with accuracy greater than 90&percnt; for some phrases. Clearly, such an attack calls into question the efficacy of current VoIP encryption standards. In addition, we examine the impact of various features of the underlying audio on our performance and discuss methods for mitigation.", "authors": [{"name": "charles v wright", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100660094"}, {"name": "lucas ballard", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100634737"}, {"name": "scott e coull", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100563418"}, {"name": "fabian monrose", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100391351"}, {"name": "gerald m masson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100385403"}], "title": "Uncovering Spoken Phrases in Encrypted Voice over IP Conversations", "citations": [{"Name": "Shrirang Mare ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jacob Sorber ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Minho Shin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Cory Cornelius ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "David Kotz", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kenneth G.

Such messaging offers benefits of efficiency, exclusiveness, and intensionality, but faces challenges in access control and confidentiality. In this article we explore an approach to intraenterprise ABM based on providing access control and confidentiality using information from the same attribute database exploited by the addressing scheme. We show how to address three key challenges. First, we demonstrate a manageable access control system based on attributes. Second, we demonstrate use of attribute-based encryption to provide end-to-end confidentiality. Third, we show that such a system can be efficient enough to support ABM for mid-size enterprises. Our implementation can dispatch confidential ABM messages approved by XACML policy review for an enterprise of at least 60,000 users with only seconds of latency.", "authors": [{"name": "rakesh bobba", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323488389"}, {"name": "omid fatemieh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323489564"}, {"name": "fariba khan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81344492868"}, {"name": "arindam khan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81477642570"}, {"name": "carl a gunter", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100274423"}, {"name": "himanshu khurana", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339509478"}, {"name": "manoj prabhakaran", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100181125"}], "title": "Attribute-Based Messaging: Access Control and Confidentiality", "citations": [{"Name": "Carl A.

component in Outsourced DataBase (ODB) systems. This article introduces efficient index structures for authenticating aggregation queries over large datasets. First, we design an index that features good performance characteristics for static environments. Then, we propose more involved structures for the dynamic case. Our structures feature excellent performance for authenticating queries with multiple aggregate attributes and multiple selection predicates. Furthermore, our techniques cover a large number of aggregate types, including distributive aggregates (such as SUM, COUNT, MIN, and MAX), algebraic aggregates (such as the AVG), and holistic aggregates (such as MEDIAN and QUANTILE). We have also addressed the issue of authenticating aggregation queries efficiently when the database is encrypted to protect data confidentiality. Finally, we implemented a working prototype of the proposed techniques and experimentally validated the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.", "authors": [{"name": "feifei li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100475711"}, {"name": "marios hadjieleftheriou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100283878"}, {"name": "george kollios", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339510233"}, {"name": "leonid reyzin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100633473"}], "title": "Authenticated Index Structures for Aggregation Queries", "citations": [{"Name": "Paul T.

We define a provably secure privacy-preserving key agreement scheme in an identity-based infrastructure setting, and use it to design new onion routing circuit constructions. These constructions, based on a user\u2019s selection, offer immediate or eventual forward secrecy at each node in a circuit and require significantly less computation and communication than the telescoping mechanism used by the Tor project. Further, the use of an identity-based infrastructure also leads to a reduction in the required amount of authenticated directory information. Therefore, our constructions provide practical ways to allow onion routing anonymity networks to scale gracefully.", "authors": [{"name": "aniket kate", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81440617520"}, {"name": "greg m zaverucha", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81371593665"}, {"name": "ian goldberg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100491559"}], "title": "Pairing-Based Onion Routing with Improved Forward Secrecy", "citations": [{"Name": "Michael Backes ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Aniket Kate ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Esfandiar Mohammadi", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "47\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "664\n", "Citation Count": "6\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "canada", "university": "university of waterloo", "affiliation_string": "university of waterloo", "city": "waterloo", "Name": "aniket kate"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of waterloo", "affiliation_string": "university of waterloo", "city": "waterloo", "Name": "greg m zaverucha"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of waterloo", "affiliation_string": "university of waterloo", "city": "waterloo", "Name": "ian goldberg"}]}, "Article No.: 36": {"references": ["Rakesh Agrawal , Ramakrishnan Srikant, Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases, Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, p.487-499, September 12-15, 1994\n", "Axel Bucker, Identity Management Design Guide With IBM Tivoli Identity Manager, Vervante, 2005\n", "Alessandro Colantonio , Roberto Di Pietro , Alberto Ocello, A cost-driven approach to role engineering, Proceedings of the 2008 ACM symposium on Applied computing, March 16-20, 2008, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil[doi>10.1145/1363686.1364198]\n", "Colantonio, A., Pietro, R.

Researchers have proposed to use data mining techniques to discover roles to complement the costly top-down approaches for RBAC system construction. An important problem is how to construct RBAC systems with low complexity. In this article, we define the notion of weighted structural complexity measure and propose a role mining algorithm that mines RBAC systems with low structural complexity. Another key problem that has not been adequately addressed by existing role mining approaches is how to discover roles with semantic meanings. In this article, we study the problem in two primary settings with different information availability. When the only information is user-permission relation, we propose to discover roles whose semantic meaning is based on formal concept lattices. We argue that the theory of formal concept analysis provides a solid theoretical foundation for mining roles from a user-permission relation. When user-attribute information is also available, we propose to create roles that can be explained by expressions of user-attributes. Since an expression of attributes describes a real-world concept, the corresponding role represents a real-world concept as well. Furthermore, the algorithms we propose balance the semantic guarantee of roles with system complexity. Finally, we indicate how to create a hybrid approach combining top-down candidate roles. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.", "authors": [{"name": "ian molloy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351591462"}, {"name": "hong chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314488471"}, {"name": "tiancheng li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331498191"}, {"name": "qihua wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319503861"}, {"name": "ninghui li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100475364"}, {"name": "elisa bertino", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409594658"}, {"name": "seraphin calo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100003597"}, {"name": "jorge lobo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100312737"}], "title": "Mining Roles with Multiple Objectives", "citations": [{"Name": "Jinwei Hu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Khaled M.

Many of the proposed systems were designed with the assumption that all of the nodes are altruistic. However, this assumption may be violated by compromised nodes acting maliciously to degrade the accuracy of the coordinate system. As numerous peer-to-peer applications come to rely on virtual coordinate systems to achieve good performance, it is critical to address the security of such systems.In this work, we demonstrate the vulnerability of decentralized virtual coordinate systems to insider (or Byzantine) attacks. We propose techniques to make the coordinate assignment robust to malicious attackers without increasing the communication cost. We use both spatial and temporal correlations to perform context-sensitive outlier analysis to reject malicious updates and prevent unnecessary and erroneous adaptations. We demonstrate the attacks and mitigation techniques in the context of a well-known virtual coordinate system using simulations based on three representative, real-life Internet topologies of hosts and corresponding Round Trip Times (RTT). We show the effects of the attacks and the utility of the mitigation techniques on the virtual coordinate system as seen by higher-level applications, elucidating the utility of deploying robust virtual coordinate systems as network services.", "authors": [{"name": "david zage", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81340494040"}, {"name": "cristina nita-rotaru", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100166867"}], "title": "Robust Decentralized Virtual Coordinate Systems in Adversarial Environments", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "20\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "295\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "purdue university", "city": null, "Name": "david zage"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "purdue university", "city": null, "Name": "cristina nita-rotaru"}]}, "Article No.: 30": {"references": ["Axelsson, S.1998.

Further, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) embedded in a storage device continues to operate even after client operating systems are compromised. We describe and evaluate a prototype storage IDS, built into a disk emulator, to demonstrate both feasibility and efficiency of storage-based intrusion detection.

Since anonymity can give users the license to misbehave, some variants allow the selective deanonymization (or linking) of misbehaving users upon a complaint to a Trusted Third Party (TTP). The ability of the TTP to revoke a user\u2019s privacy at any time, however, is too strong a punishment for misbehavior. To limit the scope of deanonymization, some systems have been proposed in which users can be deanonymized only if they authenticate \u201ctoo many times,\u201d such as \u201cdouble spending\u201d with electronic cash. While useful in some applications, such techniques cannot be generalized to more subjective definitions of misbehavior, for example, using such schemes it is not possible to block anonymous users who \u201cdeface too many Web pages\u201d on a Web site.We present BLAC, the first anonymous credential system in which service providers can revoke the credentials of misbehaving users without relying on a TTP . Since revoked users remain anonymous, misbehaviors can be judged subjectively without users fearing arbitrary deanonymization by a TTP . Additionally, our construction supports ad-strikes-outrevocation policy, whereby users who have been subjectively judged to have repeatedly misbehaved at leastdtimes are revoked from the system. Thus, for the first time, it is indeed possible to block anonymous users who have \u201cdefaced too many Web pages\u201d using our scheme.", "authors": [{"name": "patrick p tsang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331505554"}, {"name": "man ho au", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332488484"}, {"name": "apu kapadia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100481887"}, {"name": "sean w smith", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100076992"}], "title": "BLAC: Revoking Repeatedly Misbehaving Anonymous Users without Relying on TTPs", "citations": [{"Name": "Carlos Ga\u00f1\u00e1n ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jorge Mata-D\u00edaz ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jose L.

These attacks are based on the blind source separation algorithms widely used to recover individual signals from mixtures of signals in statistical signal processing. Since the philosophy behind the design of current anonymity networks is to mix traffic or to hide in crowds, the proposed anonymity attacks are very effective.The flow separation attack proposed for wired anonymity networks can separate the traffic in a mix network. Our experiments show that this attack is effective and scalable. By combining the flow separation method with frequency spectrum matching, a passive attacker can derive the traffic map of the mix network. We use a nontrivial network to show that the combined attack works.The proposed anonymity attacks for wireless networks can identify nodes in fully anonymized wireless networks using collections of very simple sensors. Based on a time series of counts of anonymous packets provided by the sensors, we estimate the number of nodes with the use of principal component analysis. We then proceed to separate the collected packet data into traffic flows that, with help of the spatial diversity in the available sensors, can be used to estimate the location of the wireless nodes. Our simulation experiments indicate that the estimators show high accuracy and high confidence for anonymized TCP traffic. Additional experiments indicate that the estimators perform very well in anonymous wireless networks that use traffic padding.", "authors": [{"name": "ye zhu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100415764"}, {"name": "riccardo bettati", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350573831"}], "title": "Compromising anonymous communication systems using blind source separation", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "21\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "481\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cleveland state university cleveland oh", "city": "cleveland", "Name": "ye zhu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "texas am university college station tx", "city": null, "Name": "riccardo bettati"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Boaz Barak , Shai Halevi, A model and architecture for pseudo-random generation with applications to /dev/random, Proceedings of the 12th ACM conference on Computer and communications security, November 07-11, 2005, Alexandria, VA, USA[doi>10.1145/1102120.1102148]\n", "Beaver, D. and Haber, S. 1992.

The pseudorandomness of the output of this generator is crucial for the security of almost any application running in Windows. Nevertheless, its exact algorithm was never published.We examined the binary code of a distribution of Windows 2000. This investigation was done without any help from Microsoft. We reconstructed the algorithm used by the pseudorandom number generator (namely, the function CryptGenRandom). We analyzed the security of the algorithm and found a nontrivial attack: Given the internal state of the generator, the previous state can be computed in 223steps. This attack on forward security demonstrates that the design of the generator is flawed, since it is well known how to prevent such attacks. After our analysis was published, Microsoft acknowledged that Windows XP is vulnerable to the same attack.We also analyzed the way in which the generator is used by the operating system and found that it amplifies the effect of the attack: The generator is run in user mode rather than in kernel mode; therefore, it is easy to access its state even without administrator privileges. The initial values of part of the state of the generator are not set explicitly, but rather are defined by whatever values are present on the stack when the generator is called. Furthermore, each process runs a different copy of the generator, and the state of the generator is refreshed with system-generated entropy only after generating 128KB of output for the process running it. The result of combining this observation with our attack is that learning a single state may reveal 128KB of the past and future output of the generator.The implication of these findings is that a buffer overflow attack or a similar attack can be used to learn a single state of the generator, which can then be used to predict all random values, such as SSL keys, used by a process in all its past and future operations. This attack is more severe and more efficient than known attacks in which an attacker can only learn SSL keys if it is controlling the attacked machine at the time the keys are used.", "authors": [{"name": "leo dorrendorf", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81340488894"}, {"name": "zvi gutterman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81313484752"}, {"name": "benny pinkas", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100516131"}], "title": "Cryptanalysis of the random number generator of the Windows operating system", "citations": [{"Name": "Yue Wu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yicong Zhou ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "George Saveriades ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sos Agaian ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Joseph P.

Because the information in question is often sensitive, credentials are protected according to access control policies. In traditional ATN, credentials are transmitted either in their entirety or not at all. This approach can at times fail unnecessarily, either because a cyclic dependency makes neither negotiator willing to reveal her credential before her opponent because the opponent must be authorized for all attributes packaged together in a credential to receive any of them, or because it is necessary to disclose the precise attribute values, rather than merely proving they satisfy some predicate (such as being over 21 years of age). Recently, several cryptographic credential schemes and associated protocols have been developed to address these and other problems. However, they can be used only as fragments of an ATN process. This article introduces a framework for ATN in which the diverse credential schemes and protocols can be combined, integrated, and used as needed. A policy language is introduced that enables negotiators to specify authorization requirements that must be met by an opponent to receive various amounts of information about certified attributes and the credentials that contain it. The language also supports the use of uncertified attributes, allowing them to be required as part of policy satisfaction, and to place their (automatic) disclosure under policy control.", "authors": [{"name": "jiangtao li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452596448"}, {"name": "ninghui li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100475364"}, {"name": "william h winsborough", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100048685"}], "title": "Automated trust negotiation using cryptographic credentials", "citations": [{"Name": "Jinwei Hu ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Khaled M.

In this article, we address this problem for five fundamental set operations including set intersection, cardinality of set intersection, element reduction, overthreshold set-union, and subset relation. Our protocols are obtained in the universally composable security framework, in the assumption of the probabilistic polynomial time bounded adversary, which actively controls a fixed set oftparties and the assumption of an authenticated broadcast channel. Our constructions utilize building blocks of nonmalleable NonInteractive Zero-Knowledge (NIZK) arguments, which are based on a (t+ 1,N)-threshold version (Nis the number of parties in the protocol) of the boneh-goh-nissim (BGN) cryptosystem whose underlying group supports bilinear maps, in the assumption that the public key and shares of the secret key have been generated by a trusted dealer. The previous studies were all based on the stand-alone model with the same assumptions on the adversary, broadcast channel, and key generation. For the first four operations, we propose protocols that improve the previously known results by anO(N) factor in the computation and communication complexities. For the subset relation, our protocol is the first one secure against the active adversary. Our constructions of NIZK have independent interest in that, though also mentioned as building blocks, the previous work did not illustrate how to construct them. We construct these NIZK with an additional nonmalleable property, the same complexity as claimed in the previous work, and also an improvement on the communication complexity.", "authors": [{"name": "yingpeng sang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81455605634"}, {"name": "hong shen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81327491417"}], "title": "Efficient and secure protocols for privacy-preserving set operations", "citations": [{"Name": "Ji Young Chun ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dowon Hong ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ik Rae Jeong ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dong Hoon Lee", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Privacy-preserving disjunctive normal form operations on distributed sets", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fei Chen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bruhadeshwar Bezawada ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alex X.

Given a history of packet transmissions and an excerpt of a possible packet payload, a payload attribution system (PAS) makes it feasible to identify the sources, destinations, and the times of appearance on a network of all the packets that contained the specified payload excerpt. A PAS, as one of the core components in a network forensics system, enables investigating cybercrimes on the Internet by, for example, tracing the spread of worms and viruses, identifying who has received a phishing e-mail in an enterprise, or discovering which insider allowed an unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.Due to the increasing volume of network traffic in today's networks, it is infeasible to effectively store and query all the actual packets for extended periods of time in order to allow analysis of network events for investigative purposes; therefore, we focus on extremely compressed digests of the packet activity. We propose several new methods for payload attribution, which utilize Rabin fingerprinting, shingling, and winnowing. Our best methods allow building practical payload attribution systems, which provide data reduction ratios greater than 100:1 while supporting efficient queries with very low false positive rates. We demonstrate the properties of the proposed methods and specifically analyze their performance and practicality when used as modules of a network forensics system ForNet. Our experimental results outperform current state-of-the-art methods both in terms of false positives and data reduction ratio. Finally, these approaches directly allow the collected data to be stored and queried by an untrusted party without disclosing any payload information nor the contents of queries.", "authors": [{"name": "miroslav ponec", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351591196"}, {"name": "paul giura", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81340489205"}, {"name": "joel wein", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339535542"}, {"name": "herve bronnimann", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100104935"}], "title": "New payload attribution methods for network forensic investigations", "citations": [{"Name": "Teryl Taylor ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Scott E.

These attacks are launched through specially crafted user inputs, on Web applications that use low-level string operations to construct SQL queries. In this work, we exhibit a novel and powerful scheme for automatically transforming Web applications to render them safe against all SQL injection attacks.A characteristic diagnostic feature of SQL injection attacks is that they change the intended structure of queries issued. Our technique for detecting SQL injection is to dynamically mine the programmer-intended query structure on any input, and detect attacks by comparing it against the structure of the actual query issued. We propose a simple and novel mechanism, called Candid, for mining programmer intended queries by dynamically evaluating runs over benign candidate inputs. This mechanism is theoretically well founded and is based on inferring intended queries by considering the symbolic query computed on a program run. Our approach has been implemented in a tool called Candid that retrofits Web applications written in Java to defend them against SQL injection attacks. We have also implemented Candid by modifying a Java Virtual Machine, which safeguards applications without requiring retrofitting. We report extensive experimental results that show that our approach performs remarkably well in practice.", "authors": [{"name": "prithvi bisht", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81340488044"}, {"name": "p madhusudan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100489757"}, {"name": "v n venkatakrishnan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319503212"}], "title": "CANDID: Dynamic candidate evaluations for automatic prevention of SQL injection attacks", "citations": [{"Name": "Michael D.

The protocol has \u201ceverlasting privacy\u201d: Even a computationally unbounded adversary gains no information about specific votes from observing the protocol's output. Unlike previous protocols with these properties, this protocol distributes trust between two authorities: a single corrupt authority will not cause voter privacy to be breached. Finally, the protocol is receipt-free: A voter cannot prove how she voted even if she wants to do so. We formally prove the security of the protocol in the universal composability framework, based on number-theoretic assumptions.", "authors": [{"name": "tal moran", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418595279"}, {"name": "moni naor", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100319011"}], "title": "Split-ballot voting: Everlasting privacy with distributed trust", "citations": [{"Name": "Denise Demirel ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Maria Henning ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jeroen van de Graaf ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Peter Y.

On the defensive side, a fundamental limitation of traditional host-based antimalware systems is that they run inside the very hosts they are protecting (\u201cin-the-box\u201d), making them vulnerable to counter detection and subversion by malware. To address this limitation, recent solutions based on virtual machine (VM) technologies advocate placing the malware detection facilities outside of the protected VM (\u201cout-of-the-box\u201d). However, they gain tamper resistance at the cost of losing the internal semantic view of the host, which is enjoyed by \u201cin-the-box\u201d approaches. This poses a technical challenge known as the semantic gap.In this article, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation ofVMwatcher\u2014an \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d approach that overcomes the semantic gap challenge. A new technique called guest view casting is developed to reconstruct internal semantic views (e.g., files, processes, and kernel modules) of a VM nonintrusively from the outside. More specifically, the new technique casts semantic definitions of guest OS data structures and functions on virtual machine monitor (VMM)-level VM states, so that the semantic view can be reconstructed. Furthermore, we extend guest view casting to reconstruct details of system call events (e.g., the process that makes the system call as well as the system call number, parameters, and return value) in the VM, enriching the semantic view. With the semantic gap effectively narrowed, we identify three unique malware detection and monitoring capabilities: (i) view comparison-based malware detection and its demonstration in rootkit detection; (ii) \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d deployment of off-the-shelf anti malware software with improved detection accuracy and tamper-resistance; and (iii) nonintrusive system call monitoring for malware and intrusion behavior observation. We have implemented a proof-of-concept VMwatcher prototype on a number of VMM platforms. Our evaluation experiments with real-world malware, including elusive kernel-level rootkits, demonstrate VMwatcher's practicality and effectiveness.", "authors": [{"name": "xuxian jiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319494671"}, {"name": "xinyuan wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81450593206"}, {"name": "dongyan xu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451594461"}], "title": "Stealthy malware detection and monitoring through VMM-based \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d semantic view reconstruction", "citations": [{"Name": "Ting Liu ", "Country": "mali", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiaohong Guan ", "Country": "mali", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yu Qu ", "Country": "mali", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yanan Sun", "Country": "mali", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "A layered classification for malicious function identification and malware detection", "Country": "mali", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chandrabhanu Mahapatra ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "S.

An undetectable insider threat\u2014voluntary partial trace disclosures by server administrators\u2014remains a troubling source of vulnerability. An administrator's cooperation could be the resulting coercion, bribery, or a simple change of interests. While eliminating this insider threat is impossible, it is feasible to deter such unauthorized disclosures by bundling them with additional penalties. We abstract these costs with collateral keys, which grant access to customizable resources. This article introduces the notion of trace-deterring mix-networks, which encode collateral keys for every server-node into every end-to-end message trace. The network reveals no keying material when the input-to-output transitions of individual servers remain secret. Two permutation strategies for encoding key information into traces, mix-and-flip and all-or-nothing, are presented. We analyze their trade-offs with respect to computational efficiency, anonymity sets, and colluding message senders. Our techniques have sufficiently low overhead for deployment in large-scale elections, thereby providing a sort of publicly verifiable privacy guarantee.", "authors": [{"name": "xiaofeng wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81372591949"}, {"name": "philippe golle", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100462814"}, {"name": "markus jakobsson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100035930"}, {"name": "alex tsow", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100475194"}], "title": "Deterring voluntary trace disclosure in re-encryption mix-networks", "citations": [{"Name": "Chien-Cheng Huang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Feng-Yu Lin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Frank Yeong-Sung Lin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yeali S.

One consequence of these goals is that these services leak some information about the network latency between the sender and one or more nodes in the system. We present two attacks on low-latency anonymity schemes using this information. The first attack allows a pair of colluding Web sites to predict, based on local timing information and with no additional resources, whether two connections from the same Tor exit node are using the same circuit with high confidence. The second attack requires more resources but allows a malicious Web site to gain several bits of information about a client each time he visits the site. We evaluate both attacks against two low-latency anonymity protocols\u2014the Tor network and the MultiProxy proxy aggregator service\u2014and conclude that both are highly vulnerable to these attacks.", "authors": [{"name": "nicholas hopper", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100172412"}, {"name": "eugene y vasserman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319503296"}, {"name": "eric chan-tin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81340488087"}], "title": "How much anonymity does network latency leak?", "citations": [{"Name": "Michael Herrmann ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Christian Grothoff", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nayantara Mallesh ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Matthew Wright", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Peng Zhou ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiapu Luo ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rocky K.

In contrast, prior work on the multicast authentication problem has focused on a less powerful adversarial network model or has examined a considerably more restrictive setting with specific timing or structural assumptions about the network.We model the ability of the network to modify a stream ofnpackets with two parameters: thesurvival rate\u03b1 (0 <\u03b1\u2264 1) denoting the fraction of the packets that are guaranteed to reach any particular receiver unmodified and theflood rate\u03b2 (\u03b2 \u2265 1) indicating the factor by which the size of the received stream at any particular receiver may exceed the size of the transmitted stream. Combining error-correcting codes with standard cryptographic primitives, our approach gives almost the same security guarantees as if each packet were individually signed, but requires only one signature operation for the entire stream and adds to each transmitted packet only a small amount of authentication information, proportional to \u03b2/\u03b12. We prove the security and correctness of our scheme and analyze its performance in terms of communication overhead and computational effort at the sender and the receiver. Our results demonstrate how list decoding can be transformed into unambiguous decoding in the public-key model and the bounded computational model for the underlying communication channel. Overall, our technique provides an authenticated error-correcting code of independent interest that may be useful in other settings.", "authors": [{"name": "anna lysyanskaya", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100335021"}, {"name": "roberto tamassia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100005178"}, {"name": "nikos triandopoulos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81381593303"}], "title": "Authenticated error-correcting codes with applications to multicast authentication", "citations": [{"Name": "Rafael V.

In this paper, we investigate attacks by corrupt group members that degrade the anonymity of each protocol over time. We prove that when a particular initiator continues communication with a particular responder across path reformations, existing protocols are subject to the attack. We use this result to place an upper bound on how long existing protocols, including Crowds, Onion Routing, Hordes, Web Mixes, and DC-Net, can maintain anonymity in the face of the attacks described. This provides a basis for comparing these protocols against each other. Our results show that fully connected DC-Net is the most resilient to these attacks, but it suffers from scalability issues that keep anonymity group sizes small. We also show through simulation that the underlying topography of the DC-Net affects the resilience of the protocol: as the number of neighbors a node has increases the strength of the protocol increases, at the cost of higher communication overhead.", "authors": [{"name": "matthew k wright", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100659958"}, {"name": "micah adler", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100059176"}, {"name": "brian neil levine", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100230239"}, {"name": "clay shields", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100527773"}], "title": "The predecessor attack: An analysis of a threat to anonymous communications systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Imran Memon ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kamenyi Domenic ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hina Memon ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rizwan Akhtar ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wang Yong ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fengli Zhang", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rumor Riding: An Anonymity Approach for Decentralized Peer to Peer Systems", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "George Danezis ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Claudia Diaz ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Emilia K\u00e4sper ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Carmela Troncoso", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tariq Elahi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kevin Bauer ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mashael AlSabah ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Roger Dingledine ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ian Goldberg", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gauri Vakde ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Radhika Bibikar ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zhengyi Le ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Matthew Wright", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Timothy G.

This scheme requires akey predistribution centerto generate multiple hash chains and allocates exactly one hash value from each chain to a group member. A group member can use its allocated hash values (secrets) to generate group and subgroup keys. Key distribution can be offline or online via the key distribution protocol. Once keys are distributed, this scheme enables a group member to communicate with any possible subgroupswithoutthe help of the key distribution center, and without having to leave the overall group, thus avoiding any setup delay. Our scheme is suitable for applications where the population of a system is stable, group size is moderate, subgroup formation is frequent, and the application is delay sensitive.

We examine a case where confidentiality is irrelevant to the process being modeled. In this case, integrity includes not only the authentication of origin and the lack of unauthorized changes to a document, but also the acceptance of all parties that the document is complete, signed by all parties, and cannot be modified further. This is especially critical when the document is recorded, so that it is legally the agreement or statement of record, and any copies of the document have no legal force. We show that current security models do not capture the details of this process. We then present a new security model for this process. This model captures the recordation process, and augments, rather than supplants, existing models.

The \"fast-track\" mechanism provides a client-side cache of a server's public parameters and negotiated parameters in the course of an initial, enabling handshake. These parameters need not be resent on subsequent handshakes. Fast-track reduces both network traffic and the number of round trips, and requires no additional server state. These savings are most useful in high-latency environments such as wireless networks. The second mechanism, \"client-side session caching,\" allows the server to store an encrypted version of the session information on a client, allowing a server to maintain a much larger number of active sessions in a given memory footprint. Our design is fully backward-compatible with TLS: extended clients can interoperate with servers unaware of our extensions and vice versa. We have implemented our fast-track proposal to demonstrate the resulting efficiency improvements.", "authors": [{"name": "hovav shacham", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100234228"}, {"name": "dan boneh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100047204"}, {"name": "eric rescorla", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100069779"}], "title": "Client-side caching for TLS", "citations": [{"Name": "Wassim Itani ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ayman Kayssi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ali Chehab", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ki-Woong Park ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kyu Ho Park", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "21\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "911\n", "Citation Count": "7\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "stanford university stanford ca", "city": null, "Name": "hovav shacham"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "stanford university stanford ca", "city": null, "Name": "dan boneh"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "stanford university stanford ca", "city": null, "Name": "eric rescorla"}]}}, "date": {"month": "November", "year": "2004"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Pages: 21-59": {"references": ["C.

In order to obtain a public key, verifiers need to extract a certificate path from a network of certificates, which is called public key infrastructure (PKI), and verify the certificates on this path recursively. This is classical methodology. Nested certification is a novel methodology for efficient certificate path verification. Basic idea is to issue special certificates (called nested certificates) for other certificates. Nested certificates can be used together with classical certificates in PKIs. Such a PKI, which is called nested certificate-based PKI (NPKI), is proposed in this paper as an alternative to classical PKI. The concept of \"certificates for other certificates\" results in nested certificate paths in which the first certificate is verified cryptographically while others are verified by just fast hash computations. Thus, we can employ efficiently verifiable nested certificate paths instead of classical certificate paths. NPKI is a dynamic system and involves several authorities in order to add a new user to the system. This uses the authorities' idle time to the benefit of the verifiers. We formulate the trade-off between the nested certification overhead and the time improvement on certificate path verification. This trade-off is numerically analyzed for a 4-level 20-ary balanced tree-shaped PKI and it has been shown that the extra cost of nested certification is in acceptable limits in order to generate quickly verifiable certificate paths for certain applications. Moreover, PKI-to-NPKI transition preserves the existing hierarchy and trust relationships in the PKI, so that it can be used for PKIs with fixed topology. Although there are many certificates in NPKI, certificate revocation is no more of a problem than with classical PKIs. NPKI even has an advantage on the number of certificate revocation controls: at most two certificate revocation controls are sufficient independent of the path length. Nested certificates can be easily adopted into X.509 standard certificate structure. Both verification efficiency and revocation advantage of NPKI and nested certificates make them suitable for hierarchical PKIs of wireless applications where wireless end users have limited processing power.", "authors": [{"name": "albert levi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100296392"}, {"name": "m ufuk caglayan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100624051"}, {"name": "cetin k koc", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100574947"}], "title": "Use of nested certificates for efficient, dynamic, and trust preserving public key infrastructure", "citations": [{"Name": "Ricardo Felipe Cust\u00f3dio ", "Country": "norway", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mart\u00edn A.

Its popularity is fueled by the growing importance of group-oriented and collaborative applications. The central research challenge is secure and efficient group key management. While centralized methods are often appropriate for key distribution in large multicast-style groups, many collaborative group settings require distributed key agreement techniques. This work investigates a novel group key agreement approach which blends key trees with Diffie--Hellman key exchange. It yields a secure protocol suite called Tree-based Group Diffie--Hellman (TGDH) that is both simple and fault-tolerant.

We call these core models because they address the essence of UCON, leaving administration, delegation, and other important but second-order issues for later work. The term usage control is a generalization of access control to cover authorizations, obligations, conditions, continuity (ongoing controls), and mutability. Traditionally, access control has dealt only with authorization decisions on users' access to target resources. Obligations are requirements that have to be fulfilled by obligation subjects for allowing access. Conditions are subject and object independent environmental or system requirements that have to be satisfied for access. In today's highly dynamic, distributed environment, obligations and conditions are also crucialdecision factorsfor richer and finer controls on usage of digital resources. Although they have been discussed occasionally in recent literature, most authors have been motivated from specific target problems and thereby limited in their approaches. The UCONABCmodel integrates these diverse concepts in a unified framework. Traditional authorization decisions are generally made at the time of requests but hardly recognizeongoing controlsfor relatively long-lived access or for immediate revocation. Moreover,mutabilityissues that deal with updates on related subject or object attributes as a consequence of access have not been systematically studied.Unlike other studies that have targeted on specific problems or issues, the UCONABCmodel seeks to enrich and refine the access control discipline in its definition and scope. UCONABCcovers traditional access controls such as mandatory, discretionary, and role-based access control. Digital rights management and other modern access controls are also covered. UCONABClays the foundation for next generation access controls that are required for today's real-world information and systems security. This paper articulates the core of this new area of UCON and develops several detailed models.", "authors": [{"name": "jaehong park", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452601300"}, {"name": "ravi sandhu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81312485832"}], "title": "The UCONABCusage control model", "citations": [{"Name": "Yehia Elrakaiby ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Moussa Amrani ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yves Traon", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Maicon Stihler ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Altair Olivo Santin ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alcides Calsavara ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Arlindo L.

It has been designed to help automate the process of tracing attackers who log on to a series of hosts to hide their identity. STOP utilizes the Identification Protocol infrastructure, improving both its capabilities and user privacy. On request, the STOP protocol saves user-level and application-level data associated with a particular TCP connection and returns a random token specifically related to that session. The saved data are not revealed to the requester unless the token is returned to the local administrator, who verifies the legitimacy of the need for the release of information. The protocol supports recursive traceback requests to gather information about the entire path of a connection. This allows an incident investigator to trace attackers to their home systems, but does not violate the privacy of normal users. This paper details the new protocol and presents implementation and performance results.", "authors": [{"name": "brian carrier", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100467967"}, {"name": "clay shields", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100527773"}], "title": "The session token protocol for forensics and traceback", "citations": [{"Name": "David D.

A quorum may be necessary, or a veto may be possible for such a decision. In this paper, we present two major contributions: We develop arole-based access control(RBAC) approach for specifying distributed administration requirements, and procedures between administrators, or administration teams, extending earlier work on distributed (modular) authorization. While a comprehensive specification in such a language is conceivable it would be quite tedious to evaluate, or analyze, their operational aspects and properties in practice. For this reason we create a new class of extended Petri Nets called Administration Nets (Adm-Nets) such that any RBAC specification of (cooperative) administration requirements (given in terms of predicate logic formulas) can be embedded into an Adm-Net. This net behaves within the constraints specified by the logical formulas, and at the same time, itexplicitlyexhibits all needed operational details such as allowing for an efficient and comprehensive formal analysis of administrative behavior. We introduce the new concepts and illustrate their use in several examples. While Adm-Nets are much more refined and (behaviorally) explicit than workflow systems our work provides for a constructive step towards novel workflow management tools as well. We demonstrate the usefulness of Adm-Nets by modeling typical examples of administration processes concerned with sets of distributed authorization rules.", "authors": [{"name": "horst f wedde", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100496454"}, {"name": "mario lischka", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100287442"}], "title": "Modular authorization and administration", "citations": [{"Name": "Hind Rakkay ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hanifa Boucheneb", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Security Analysis of Role Based Access Control Models Using Colored Petri Nets and CPNtools", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "13\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "1198\n", "Citation Count": "5\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of dortmund dortmund germany", "city": "dortmund", "Name": "horst f wedde"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of dortmund dortmund germany", "city": "dortmund", "Name": "mario lischka"}]}, "Pages: 457-488": {"references": ["Amir, Y., Danilov, C., Miskin-Amir, M., Schultz, J., and Stanton, J. 2004.

Several group key management techniques were proposed in the last decade, all assuming the existence of an underlying group communication infrastructure to provide reliable and ordered message delivery as well as group membership information. Despite analysis, implementation, and deployment of some of these techniques, the actual costs associated with group key management have been poorly understood so far. This resulted in an undesirable tendency: on the one hand, adopting suboptimal security for reliable group communication, while, on the other hand, constructing excessively costly group key management protocols.This paper presents a thorough performance evaluation of five notable distributed key management techniques (for collaborative peer groups) integrated with a reliable group communication system. An in-depth comparison and analysis of the five techniques is presented based on experimental results obtained in actual local- and wide-area networks. The extensive performance measurement experiments conducted for all methods offer insights into their scalability and practicality. Furthermore, our analysis of the experimental results highlights several observations that are not obvious from the theoretical analysis.", "authors": [{"name": "yair amir", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100505643"}, {"name": "yongdae kim", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100658424"}, {"name": "cristina nita-rotaru", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100166867"}, {"name": "gene tsudik", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100064107"}], "title": "On the performance of group key agreement protocols", "citations": [{"Name": "Junghyun Nam ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Juryon Paik ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ung Mo Kim ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dongho Won", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Resource-aware protocols for authenticated group key exchange in integrated wired and wireless networks", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jos\u00e9 M.

The set of resources is usually static, and an access control policy associated with each resource specifies who is authorized to access the resource. In this article, we turn the traditional client/server access control model on its head and address how to protect the sensitive content that clients disclose to and receive from servers. Since client content is often dynamically generated at run-time, the usual approach of associating a policy with the resource (content) a priori does not work. We propose a general-purpose access control model designed to detect whenever sensitive information is being transmitted, and determine whether the sender or receiver is authorized. The model identifies sensitive content, maps the sensitive content to an access control policy, and establishes the trustworthiness of the sender or receiver before the sensitive content is disclosed or received.

The LSM framework consists of a set of authorization hooks inserted into the Linux kernel to enable additional authorizations to be performed (e.g., for mandatory access control). When compared to system call interposition, authorization within the kernel has both security and performance advantages, but it is more difficult to verify that placement of the LSM hooks ensures that all the kernel's security-sensitive operations are authorized. Static analysis has been used previously to verified mediation (i.e., that some hook mediates access to a security-sensitive operation), but that work did not determine whether the necessary set of authorizations were checked. In this paper, we develop an approach to test theconsistencyof the relationships between security-sensitive operations and LSM hooks. The idea is that whenever a security-sensitive operation is performed as part of specifiable event, a particular set of LSM hooks must have mediated that operation. This work demonstrates that the number of events that impact consistency is manageable and that the notion of consistency is useful for verifying correctness.

In situations where there are intensive attacks, not only will actual alerts be mixed with false alerts, but the amount of alerts will also become unmanageable. As a result, it is difficult for human users or intrusion response systems to understand the alerts and take appropriate actions. This paper presents a sequence of techniques to address this issue. The first technique constructs attack scenarios by correlating alerts on the basis ofprerequisitesandconsequencesof attacks. Intuitively, the prerequisite of an attack is the necessary condition for the attack to be successful, while the consequence of an attack is the possible outcome of the attack. Based on the prerequisites and consequences of different types of attacks, the proposed method correlates alerts by (partially) matching the consequences of some prior alerts with the prerequisites of some later ones. Moreover, to handle large collections of alerts, this paper presents a set of interactive analysis utilities aimed at facilitating the investigation of large sets of intrusion alerts. This paper also presents the development of a toolkit named TIAA, which provides system support for interactive intrusion analysis. This paper finally reports the experiments conducted to validate the proposed techniques with the 2000 DARPA intrusion detection scenario-specific datasets, and the data collected at the DEFCON 8 Capture the Flag event.", "authors": [{"name": "peng ning", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332518403"}, {"name": "yun cui", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100229139"}, {"name": "douglas s reeves", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100228882"}, {"name": "dingbang xu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100195506"}], "title": "Techniques and tools for analyzing intrusion alerts", "citations": [{"Name": "Safaa O.

NGC distinguishes itself in the care with which the man-machine process was analyzed and shaped to improve the security of the whole process.

However, procedures for authorizing the holders of these identities to perform specific actions still need additional research and development. While there are a number of proposed standards for authorization structures and protocols such as KeyNote, SPKI, and SAML based on X.509 or other key-based identities, none have been widely adopted. As part of an effort to use X.509 identities to provide authorization in highly distributed environments, we have developed and deployed an authorization service based on X.509 identified users and access policy contained in certificates signed by X.509 identified stakeholders. The major goal of this system, called Akenti, is to produce a usable authorization system for an environment consisting of distributed resources used by geographically and administratively distributed users. Akenti assumes communication between users and resources over a secure protocol such as transport layer security (TLS) to provide mutual authentication with X.509 certificates. This paper explains the authorization model and policy language used by Akenti, and how we have implemented an Apache authorization module to provide Akenti authorization.", "authors": [{"name": "mary r thompson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100436630"}, {"name": "abdelilah essiari", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100201537"}, {"name": "srilekha mudumbai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100626801"}], "title": "Certificate-based authorization policy in a PKI environment", "citations": [{"Name": "Shangyuan Guan ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yiduo Mei ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiaoshe Dong ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zhao Wang ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zhengdong Zhu", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "A Novel Automated Trust Negotiation Framework for Securing Grids", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jian Zhou ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xian-Wei Zhou", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Anonymous Shared Certificate Entity Authentication Protocol", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Cheng-chun Shu ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Erica Y.

Representing access policies as constraint logic programs makes it possible to support certain policy options, constraint checks, and administrator queries that cannot be represented by using related methods (like logic programs). Representing an access control policy as a constraint logic program also enables access requests and constraint checks to be efficiently evaluated.", "authors": [{"name": "steve barker", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100376938"}, {"name": "peter j stuckey", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100133272"}], "title": "Flexible access control policy specification with constraint logic programming", "citations": [{"Name": "Petros Belsis ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Stefanos Gritzalis ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sokratis K.

This paper presents a new approach for handling intrusion detection alarms more efficiently. Central to this approach is the notion that each alarm occurs for a reason, which is referred to as the alarm'sroot causes. This paper observes that a few dozens of rather persistent root causes generally account for over 90&percnt; of the alarms that an intrusion detection system triggers. Therefore, we argue that alarms should be handled by identifying and removing the most predominant and persistent root causes. To make this paradigm practicable, we propose a novel alarm-clustering method that supports the human analyst in identifying root causes. We present experiments with real-world intrusion detection alarms to show how alarm clustering helped us identify root causes. Moreover, we show that the alarm load decreases quite substantially if the identified root causes are eliminated so that they can no longer trigger alarms in the future.", "authors": [{"name": "klaus julisch", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100334268"}], "title": "Clustering intrusion detection alarms to support root cause analysis", "citations": [{"Name": "Safaa O.

Our main attention is placed on subscription-based remote services (e.g., subscription to newspapers and databases) where the service manager charges a flat fee for a period of time independent of the actual number of times the service is requested.We start by pointing out that restricting the access to such services by using X.509 certificates and the SSL/TLS protocol, while preserving the interests of the service managers, neglects the right to privacy of the users.We then propose the concept of acrypto certificateand the Secure andPrivateSocket Layer protocol (SPSL protocol, in short) and show how they can be used to preserve user privacy and, at the same time, protecting the interests of the service managers. The SPSL protocol only requires the user to have astandardX.509 certificate (with an RSA key) and does not require the user to get any special ad hoc certificate.Finally, we show the viability of the proposed solution by describing a system based on SPSL for secure and private access to subscription-based web services. Our implementation includes an SPSL proxy for a TLS-enabled web client and a module for the Apache web server along with administrative tools for the server side. The system has been developed starting from the implementation of an API for the SPSL protocol that we describe in the paper.", "authors": [{"name": "pino persiano", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100328652"}, {"name": "ivan visconti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100324047"}], "title": "A secure and private system for subscription-based remote services", "citations": [{"Name": "Christian Stingl ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daniel Slamanig", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marina Blanton ", "Country": "sweden", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mikhail J.

Automated trust negotiation is an approach to establishing trust between parties so that such interactions can take place, through the use of access control policies that specify what combinations of digital credentials a stranger must disclose to gain access to a local resource. A party can use many different strategies to negotiate trust, offering tradeoffs between the length of the negotiation, the amount of extraneous information disclosed, and the computational effort expended. To preserve parties' autonomy, each party should ideally be able to choose its negotiation strategy independently, while still being guaranteed that negotiations will succeed whenever possible---that the two parties' strategies will interoperate. In this paper we provide the formal underpinnings for that goal, by formalizing the concepts of negotiation protocols, strategies, and interoperation. We show how to model the information flow of a negotiation for use in analyzing strategy interoperation. We also present two large sets of strategies whose members all interoperate with one another, and show that these sets contain many practical strategies. We develop the theory for black-box propositional credentials as well as credentials with internal structure, and for access control policies whose contents are (respectively are not) sensitive. We also discuss how these results fit into TrustBuilder, our prototype system for trust negotiation.", "authors": [{"name": "ting yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100471558"}, {"name": "marianne winslett", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100471278"}, {"name": "kent e seamons", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100506951"}], "title": "Supporting structured credentials and sensitive policies through interoperable strategies for automated trust negotiation", "citations": [{"Name": "Suroop Mohan Chandran ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Korporn Panyim ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "James B.

Moreover, emerging applications and data models call for flexible and expressive access control models. This has led to an extensive research activity that has resulted in the definition of a variety of access control models that differ greatly with respect to the access control policies they support. Thus, the need arises for developing tools for reasoning about the characteristics of these models. These tools should support users in the tasks of model specification, analysis of model properties, and authorization management. For example, they must be able to identify inconsistencies in the model specification and must support the administrator in comparing the expressive power of different models. In this paper, we make a first step in this direction by proposing a formal framework for reasoning about access control models. The framework we propose is based on a logical formalism and is general enough to model discretionary, mandatory, and role-based access control models. Each instance of the proposed framework corresponds to a C-Datalog program, interpreted according to a stable model semantics. In the paper, besides giving the syntax and the formal semantics of our framework, we show some examples of its application. Additionally, we present a number of dimensions along which access control models can be analyzed and compared. For each dimension, we show decidability results and we present some examples of its application.", "authors": [{"name": "elisa bertino", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409594658"}, {"name": "barbara catania", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100298950"}, {"name": "elena ferrari", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339498938"}, {"name": "paolo perlasca", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100510260"}], "title": "A logical framework for reasoning about access control models", "citations": [{"Name": "Yun Bai", "Country": "chile", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "A Knowledge Based Formal Language for Securing Information Systems", "Country": "chile", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mahesh V.

Strand spaces have some similarities to a formalism used successfully to model protocols for distributed systems, namelymulti-agent systems. We explore the exact relationship between these two frameworks here. It turns out that a key difference is the handling of agents, which are unspecified in strand spaces and explicit in multi-agent systems. We provide a family of translations from strand spaces to multi-agent systems parameterized by the choice of agents in the strand space. We also show that not every multi-agent system of interest can be expressed as a strand space. This reveals a lack of expressiveness in the strand-space framework that can be characterized by our translation. To highlight this lack of expressiveness, we show one simple way in which strand spaces can be extended to model more systems.", "authors": [{"name": "joseph y halpern", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100537160"}, {"name": "riccardo pucella", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100260833"}], "title": "On the relationship between strand spaces and multi-agent systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Egon Baars ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rineke Verbrugge", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Adjusting a Knowledge-Based Algorithm for Multi-agent Communication for CPS", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Languages", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "10\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "801\n", "Citation Count": "6\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cornell university ithica ny", "city": null, "Name": "joseph y halpern"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cornell university ithica ny", "city": null, "Name": "riccardo pucella"}]}, "Pages: 128-171": {"references": ["Mart\u00edn Abadi, On SDSI's linked local name spaces, Journal of Computer Security, v.6 n.1-2, p.3-21, Sept. 1998\n", "Mart\u00edn Abadi , Michael Burrows , Butler Lampson , Gordon Plotkin, A calculus for access control in distributed systems, ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems (TOPLAS), v.15 n.4, p.706-734, Sept. 1993[doi>10.1145/155183.155225]\n", "T.

Authorization decisions are needed in electronic commerce, mobile-code execution, remote resource sharing, privacy protection, and many other applications. We adopt the trust-management approach, in which \"authorization\" is viewed as a \"proof-of-compliance\" problem: Does a set of credentials prove that a request complies with a policy?We develop a logic-based language, calledDelegation Logic(DL), to represent policies, credentials, and requests in distributed authorization. In this paper, we describe D1LP, the monotonic version of DL. D1LP extends the logic-programming (LP) language Datalog with expressive delegation constructs that feature delegation depth and a wide variety of complex principals (including, but not limited to, k-out-of-n thresholds). Our approach to defining and implementing D1LP is based on tractably compiling D1LP programs into ordinary logic programs (OLPs). This compilation approach enables D1LP to be implemented modularly on top of existing technologies for OLP, for example, Prolog.As a trust-management language, D1LP provides a concept of proof-of-compliance that is founded on well-understood principles of logic programming and knowledge representation. D1LP also provides a logical framework for studying delegation.", "authors": [{"name": "ninghui li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100475364"}, {"name": "benjamin n grosof", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100432747"}, {"name": "joan feigenbaum", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100346986"}], "title": "Delegation logic: A logic-based approach to distributed authorization", "citations": [{"Name": "Isaac Agudo ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Javier Lopez ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jose A.

An access control space represents the permission assignment state of a subject or role. For example, the set of permissions explicitly assigned to a role defines itsspecifiedsubspace, and the set of constraints precluding assignment to that role defines itsprohibitedsubspace. In analyzing these subspaces, we identify two problems: (1) often a significant portion of an access control space has unknown assignment semantics, which indicates that the policy is underspecified; and (2) often high-level assignments and constraints that are easily understood result in conflicts, where resolution often leads to significantly more complex specifications. We have developed a prototype system, called Gokyo, that computes access control spaces. Gokyo identifies the unknown subspace to assist system administrators in developing more complete policy specifications. Also, Gokyo identifies conflicting subspaces and enables system administrators to resolve conflicts in a variety of ways in order to preserve the simplicity of constraint specification. We demonstrate Gokyo by analyzing a Web server policy example and examine its utility by applying it to the SELinux example policy. Even for the extensive SELinux example policy, we find that only eight additional expressions are necessary to resolve Apache administrator policy conflicts.", "authors": [{"name": "trent jaeger", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100654847"}, {"name": "xiaolan zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81450595048"}, {"name": "antony edwards", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100595987"}], "title": "Policy management using access control spaces", "citations": [{"Name": "Anu Singh ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "C.

In today's distributed systems, a user often needs to act on another user's behalf with some subset of his/her rights. Most systems have attempted to resolve such delegation requirements with ad-hoc mechanisms by compromising existing disorganized policies or simply attaching additional components to their applications. Still, there is a strong need in the large, distributed systems for a mechanism that provides effective privilege delegation and revocation management. This paper describes a rule-based framework for role-based delegation and revocation. The basic idea behind a role-based delegation is that users themselves may delegate role authorities to others to carry out some functions authorized to the former. We present a role-based delegation model called RDM2000 (role-based delegation model 2000) supporting hierarchical roles and multistep delegation. Different approaches for delegation and revocation are explored. A rule-based language for specifying and enforcing policies on RDM2000 is proposed. We describe a proof-of-concept prototype implementation of RDM2000 to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework and provide secure protocols for managing delegations. The prototype is a web-based application for law enforcement agencies allowing reliable delegation and revocation. The future directions are also discussed.", "authors": [{"name": "longhua zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100121459"}, {"name": "gail-joon ahn", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375604762"}, {"name": "bei-tseng chu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451595766"}], "title": "A rule-based framework for role-based delegation and revocation", "citations": [{"Name": "Xu Liao ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Li Zhang ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Stephen C.

Besides being an essential information delivery tool, the Web is increasingly being regarded as an extension of the organization itself, directly integrated with its operating processes. As this transformation takes place, security grows in importance. IBM Tivoli Access Manager offers a shared infrastructure for authentication and access management, technologies that have begun to emerge in the commercial marketplace. This paper describes the Authorization Service provided by IBM Tivoli Access Manager for e-business (AM) and its use by AM family members as well as third-party applications. Policies are defined over a protected object namespace and stored in a database, which is managed via a management console and accessed through an Authorization API. The protected object namespace abstracts from heterogeneous systems and thus enables the definition of consistent policies and their centralized management. ACL inheritance and delegated management allow these policies to be managed efficiently. The Authorization API allows applications with their own access control requirements to decouple authorization logic from application logic. Policy checking can be externalized by using either a proxy that sits in front of the Web servers and application servers or a plug-in that examines the request. Thus, AM familiy members establish a single entry point to enforce enterprise policies that regulate access to corporate data.", "authors": [{"name": "gunter karjoth", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100237815"}], "title": "Access control with IBM Tivoli access manager", "citations": [{"Name": "Achim D.

However, due to the inherent limitations of these systems and the increasing use of encryption in communication, intrusion detection and prevention have once again moved back to the host systems themselves. In this paper, we describe our experiences with building BlueBox, a host-based intrusion detection system. Our approach, based on the technique of system call introspection, can be viewed as creating an infrastructure for defining and enforcing very fine-grained process capabilities in the kernel. These capabilities are specified as a set of rules (policies) for regulating access to system resources on a per executable basis. The language for expressing the rules is intuitive and sufficiently expressive to effectively capture security boundaries.We have prototyped our approach on Linux operating system kernel and have built rule templates for popular daemons such as Apache and wu-ftpd. Our design has been validated by testing against a comprehensive database of known attacks. Our system has been designed to minimize the kernel changes and performance impact and thus can be ported easily to new kernels. We describe the motivation and rationale behind BlueBox, its design, implementation on Linux, and how it relates to prior work on detecting and preventing intrusions on host systems.", "authors": [{"name": "suresh n chari", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100515611"}, {"name": "pau-chen cheng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413599055"}], "title": "BlueBoX: A policy-driven, host-based intrusion detection system", "citations": [{"Name": "Taieb Znati ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "James Amadei ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daniel R.

Our focus is to minimize the size of the communication overhead required to authenticate the packets. Our approach is to encode the hash values and the signatures with Rabin's Information Dispersal Algorithm (IDA) to construct an authentication scheme that amortizes a single signature operation over multiple packets. This strategy is especially efficient in terms of space overhead, because just the essential elements needed for authentication (i.e., one hash per packet and one signature per group of packets) are used in conjunction with an erasure code that is space optimal. Using asymptotic techniques, we derive the authentication probability of our scheme using two different bursty loss models. A lower bound of the authentication probability is also derived for one of the loss models. To evaluate the performance of our scheme, we compare our technique with four other previously proposed schemes using empirical results.", "authors": [{"name": "jung min park", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81540407856"}, {"name": "edwin k p chong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100287686"}, {"name": "howard jay siegel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339528205"}], "title": "Efficient multicast stream authentication using erasure codes", "citations": [{"Name": "Ya-Jeng Lin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shiuhpyng Shieh ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Warren W.

Due to the need to compare, contrast, and compose such protected information resources, access control policies regulating their manipulation need to be compared, contrasted, and composed. An algebra for manipulating such access control policies at a higher (propositional) level, where the operations of the algebra are abstracted from their specification details, is the subject of this paper. This algebra is applicable to policies that have controlled nondeterminism andall or nothingassignments of access privileges in their specification. These requirements reflect current practices in discretionary and role-based access control models. Therefore, the proposed algebra can be used to reason about role-based access control policies combined with other forms of discretionary policies. We show how to use algebraic identities to reason about consistency, completeness, and determinacy of composed policies using similar properties of their constituents.", "authors": [{"name": "duminda wijesekera", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100523578"}, {"name": "sushil jajodia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100609407"}], "title": "A propositional policy algebra for access control", "citations": [{"Name": "Soumya Maity ", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Soumya K.

The SAL model checker is used to model and verify a collection of stateful domains with protected resources and local MAC policies attempting to access needed resources from other domains. The model is described along with verification conditions. The need to control state-space explosion is motivated and techniques for writing theorems and limiting domains explored.

Smart grids provide bidirectional communication between meters and head-end systems through Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). Recent studies highlight the threats targeting AMI. Despite the need for tailored Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for smart grids, very limited progress has been made in this area. Unlike traditional networks, smart grids have their own unique challenges, such as limited computational power devices and potentially high deployment cost, that restrict the deployment options of intrusion detectors. We show that smart grids exhibit deterministic and predictable behavior that can be accurately modeled to detect intrusion. However, it can also be leveraged by the attackers to launch evasion attacks. To this end, in this article, we present a robust mutation-based intrusion detection system that makes the behavior unpredictable for the attacker while keeping it deterministic for the system. We model the AMI behavior using event logs collected at smart collectors, which in turn can be verified using the invariant specifications generated from the AMI behavior and mutable configuration. Event logs are modeled using fourth-order Markov chain and specifications are written in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). To counter evasion and mimicry attacks, we propose a configuration randomization module. The approach provides robustness against evasion and mimicry attacks; however, we discuss that it still can be evaded to a certain extent. We validate our approach on a real-world dataset of thousands of meters collected at the AMI of a leading utility provider.", "authors": [{"name": "muhammad qasim ali", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84459683857"}, {"name": "ehab al-shaer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339487878"}], "title": "Randomization-Based Intrusion Detection System for Advanced Metering Infrastructure*", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "185\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "55\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "185\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Hong Kong", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of north carolina charlotte charlotte nc", "city": "north", "Name": "muhammad qasim ali"}, {"country": "Hong Kong", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of north carolina charlotte charlotte nc", "city": "north", "Name": "ehab al-shaer"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Hunt Allcott. 2009.

They protect various types of assets ranging from a simple account on an online newspaper website to our health information on government websites. However, due to the inherent value they protect, attackers have developed insights into cracking/guessing passwords both offline and online. In many cases, users are forced to choose stronger passwords to comply with password policies; such policies are known to alienate users and do not significantly improve password quality. Another solution is to put in place proactive password-strength meters/checkers to give feedback to users while they create new passwords. Millions of users are now exposed to these meters on highly popular web services that use user-chosen passwords for authentication. More recently, these meters are also being built into popular password managers, which protect several user secrets including passwords. Recent studies have found evidence that some meters actually guide users to choose better passwords\u2014which is a rare bit of good news in password research. However, these meters are mostly based on ad hoc design. At least, as we found, most vendors do not provide any explanation for their design choices, sometimes making them appear as a black box. We analyze password meters deployed in selected popular websites and password managers. We document obfuscated source-available meters, infer the algorithm behind the closed-source ones, and measure the strength labels assigned to common passwords from several password dictionaries. From this empirical analysis with millions of passwords, we shed light on how the server end of some web service meters functions and provide examples of highly inconsistent strength outcomes for the same password in different meters, along with examples of many weak passwords being labeled asstrongor evenexcellent. These weaknesses and inconsistencies may confuse users in choosing a stronger password, and thus may weaken the purpose of these meters. On the other hand, we believe these findings may help improve existing meters and possibly make them an effective tool in the long run.", "authors": [{"name": "xavier de carne de carnavalet", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658714942"}, {"name": "mohammad mannan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309513152"}], "title": "A Large-Scale Evaluation of High-Impact Password Strength Meters", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "327\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "30\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "327\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "xavier de carne de carnavalet"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "mohammad mannan"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Andreas Abel , Jan Reineke, Measurement-based modeling of the cache replacement policy, Proceedings of the 2013 IEEE 19th Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS), p.65-74, April 09-11, 2013[doi>10.1109/RTAS.2013.6531080]\n", "AbsInt Angewandte Informatik GmbH. 2015.

Our technical contributions include novel abstractions to efficiently compute precise overapproximations of the possible side-channel observations for each of these adversaries. These approximations then yield upper bounds on the amount of information that is revealed.In case studies, we apply CacheAudit to binary executables of algorithms for sorting and encryption, including the AES implementation from the PolarSSL library, and the reference implementations of the finalists of the eSTREAM stream cipher competition. The results we obtain exhibit the influence of cache size, line size, associativity, replacement policy, and coding style on the security of the executables and include the first formal proofs of security for implementations with countermeasures such as preloading and data-independent memory access patterns.", "authors": [{"name": "goran doychev", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474702614"}, {"name": "boris kopf", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81325489012"}, {"name": "laurent mauborgne", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100216710"}, {"name": "jan reineke", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351601511"}], "title": "CacheAudit: A Tool for the Static Analysis of Cache Side Channels", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "155\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "27\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "155\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Spain", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "imdea software institute madrid spain", "city": "madrid", "Name": "goran doychev"}, {"country": "Spain", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "imdea software institute madrid spain", "city": "madrid", "Name": "boris kopf"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "laurent mauborgne"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "jan reineke"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Elli Androulaki , Ghassan O.

To ensure the operation and security of Bitcoin, it is essential that all transactions and their order of execution are available to all Bitcoin users.Unavoidably, in such a setting, the security of transactions comes at odds with transaction privacy. Motivated by the fact that transaction confirmation in Bitcoin requires tens of minutes, we analyze the conditions for performing successful double-spending attacks against fast payments in Bitcoin, where the time between the exchange of currency and goods is short (in the order of a minute). We show that unless new detection techniques are integrated in the Bitcoin implementation, double-spending attacks on fast payments succeed with considerable probability and can be mounted at low cost. We propose a new and lightweight countermeasure that enables the detection of double-spending attacks in fast transactions.In light of such misbehavior, accountability becomes crucial. We show that in the specific case of Bitcoin, accountability complements privacy. To illustrate this tension, we provide accountability and privacy definition for Bitcoin, and we investigate analytically and empirically the privacy and accountability provisions in Bitcoin.", "authors": [{"name": "ghassan o karame", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81335492790"}, {"name": "elli androulaki", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384596445"}, {"name": "marc roeschlin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658720549"}, {"name": "arthur gervais", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658655969"}, {"name": "srdjan capkun", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100396056"}], "title": "Misbehavior in Bitcoin: A Study of Double-Spending and Accountability", "citations": [{"Name": "Arthur Gervais ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hubert Ritzdorf ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ghassan O.

In this article, we are interested in understanding how users (e.g., employees) behave when interacting with honeytokens, specifically addressing the following questions: Can users distinguish genuine data objects from honeytokens&quest; And, how does the user's behavior and tendency to misuse data change when he or she is aware of the use of honeytokens&quest; First, we present an automated and generic method for generating the honeytokens that are used in the subsequent behavioral studies. The results of the first study indicate that it is possible to automatically generate honeytokens that are difficult for users to distinguish from real tokens. The results of the second study unexpectedly show that users did not behave differently when informed in advance that honeytokens were planted in the database and that these honeytokens would be monitored to detect illegitimate behavior. These results can inform security system designers about the type of environmental variables that affect people's data misuse behavior and how to generate honeytokens that evade detection.", "authors": [{"name": "asaf shabtai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319501489"}, {"name": "maya bercovitch", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=89558696957"}, {"name": "lior rokach", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331503121"}, {"name": "yaakov kobi gal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367593537"}, {"name": "yuval elovici", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100379972"}, {"name": "erez shmueli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81464665619"}], "title": "Behavioral Study of Users When Interacting with Active Honeytokens", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "118\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "83\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "118\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ben-gurion university of the negev beer sheva israel", "city": "negev", "Name": "asaf shabtai"}, {"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ben-gurion university of the negev beer sheva israel", "city": "negev", "Name": "maya bercovitch"}, {"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ben-gurion university of the negev beer sheva israel", "city": "negev", "Name": "lior rokach"}, {"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ben-gurion university of the negev beer sheva israel", "city": "negev", "Name": "yaakov kobi gal"}, {"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ben-gurion university of the negev beer sheva israel", "city": "negev", "Name": "yuval elovici"}, {"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "tel-aviv university tel aviv israel", "city": "tel aviv", "Name": "erez shmueli"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2016"}}}, "Volume14": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Article No.: 32": {"references": ["Alexander, L. 2008.

In this paper we develop a technique by which game developers can enable game operators to validate the behavior of game clients as being consistent with valid execution of the sanctioned client software. Our technique employs symbolic execution of the client software to extract constraints on client-side state implied by each client-to-server message, and then uses constraint solving to determine whether the sequence of client-to-server messages can be \u201cexplained\u201d by any possible user inputs, in light of the server-to-client messages already received. The requisite constraints and solving components can be developed either simultaneously with the game or retroactively for existing games.

Basically, there are two kinds of RFID privacy notions in the literature: one based on the indistinguishability of two tags, denoted as ind-privacy, and the other based on the unpredictability of the output of an RFID protocol, denoted as unp-privacy. In this article, we first revisit the existing unpredictability-based RFID privacy models and point out their limitations. We then propose a new RFID privacy model, denoted as unp*-privacy, based on the indistinguishability of a real tag and a virtual tag. We formally clarify its relationship with the ind-privacy model. It is proven that ind-privacy is weaker than unp*-privacy. Moreover, the minimal (necessary and sufficient) condition on RFID tags to achieve unp*-privacy is determined. It is shown that if an RFID system is unp*-private, then the computational power of an RFID tag can be used to construct a pseudorandom function family provided that the RFID system is complete and sound. On the other hand, if each tag is able to compute a pseudorandom function, then the tags can be used to construct an RFID system with unp*-privacy. In this sense, a pseudorandom function family is the minimal requirement on an RFID tag's computational power for enforcing RFID system privacy.

Traditionally, these schemes have relied on powerful Trusted Third Parties (TTPs) capable of deanonymizing (or linking) users' connections. Such TTPs are undesirable because users' anonymity is not guaranteed, and users must trust them to judge misbehaviors fairly. Recent schemes such asBlacklistable Anonymous Credentials (BLAC)andEnhanced Privacy ID (EPID)support \u201cprivacy-enhanced revocation\u201d\u2014 servers can revoke misbehaving users without a TTP's involvement, and without learning the revoked users' identities.In BLAC and EPID, however, the computation required for authentication at the server islinear in the size (L) of the revocation list, which is impractical as the size approaches thousands of entries. We propose PEREA, a new anonymous authentication scheme for which this bottleneck computation isindependent of the size of the revocation list. Instead, the time complexity of authentication is linear in the size of arevocation windowK&Lt;L, the number of subsequent authentications before which a user's misbehavior must be recognized if the user is to be revoked. We extend PEREA to support more complex revocation policies that take theseverityof misbehaviors into account. Users can authenticate anonymously if theirnaughtiness, i.e., the sum of the severities of their blacklisted misbehaviors, is below a certain naughtiness threshold. We call our extension PEREA-Naughtiness. We prove the security of our constructions, and validate their efficiency as compared to BLAC analytically and quantitatively.", "authors": [{"name": "m ho au", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332488484"}, {"name": "p p tsang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331505554"}, {"name": "a kapadia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100481887"}], "title": "PEREA: Practical TTP-free revocation of repeatedly misbehaving anonymous users", "citations": [{"Name": "Ryan Henry ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ian Goldberg", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Man Ho Au ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Apu Kapadia", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "30\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "307\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "australia", "university": "university of wollongong", "affiliation_string": "university of wollongong australia", "city": "wollongong", "Name": "m ho au"}, {"country": "Jamaica", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "dartmouth college hanover nh", "city": "hanover", "Name": "p p tsang"}, {"country": "india", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "indiana university bloomington in", "city": null, "Name": "a kapadia"}]}, "Article No.: 28": {"references": ["Al-Riyami, S.

However, the analysis of group key exchange (GKE) protocols has not been as extensive as that of 2PKE protocols. Particularly, an important security attribute calledkey compromise impersonation (KCI) resiliencehas been completely ignored for the case of GKE protocols. Informally, a protocol is said to provide KCI resilience if the compromise of the long-term secret key of a protocol participantAdoes not allow the adversary to impersonate an honest participantBtoA. In this paper, we argue that KCI resilience for GKE protocols is at least as important as it is for 2PKE protocols.Our first contribution is revised definitions of security for GKE protocols considering KCI attacks by both outsider and insider adversaries. We also give a new proof of security for an existing two-round GKE protocol under the revised security definitions assuming random oracles. We then show how to achieve insider KCIR in a generic way using a known compiler in the literature. As one may expect, this additional security assurance comes at the cost of an extra round of communication. Finally, we show that a few existing protocols are not secure against outsider KCI attacks. The attacks on these protocols illustrate the necessity of considering KCI resilience for GKE protocols.", "authors": [{"name": "m c gorantla", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100420634"}, {"name": "colin boyd", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100112037"}, {"name": "juan manuel gonzalez nieto", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418595422"}, {"name": "mark manulis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329490503"}], "title": "Modeling key compromise impersonation attacks on group key exchange protocols", "citations": [{"Name": "Sk Hafizul Islam ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Abhishek Singh", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Provably secure one-round certificateless authenticated group key agreement protocol for secure communications", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "39\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "430\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "m c gorantla"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "colin boydqueensland university of technology australia"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "juan manuel gonzalez nieto", "city": null, "Name": "juan manuel gonzalez nietoqueensland university of technology australia"}]}, "Article No.: 31": {"references": ["Aggarval, G., Mishra, N., and Pinkas, B. 2004.

While attackers act more and more globally and coordinated, network defense is limited to examine local information only due to privacy concerns. To overcome this privacy barrier, we use secure multiparty computation (MPC) for the problem of aggregating network data from multiple domains. We first optimize MPC comparison operations for processing high volume data in near real-time by not enforcing protocols to run in a constant number of synchronization rounds. We then implement a complete set of basic MPC primitives in the SEPIA library. For parallel invocations, SEPIA's basic operations are between 35 and several hundred times faster than those of comparable MPC frameworks. Using these operations, we develop four protocols tailored for distributed network monitoring and security applications: the entropy, distinct count, event correlation, and top-k protocols. Extensive evaluation shows that the protocols are suitable for near real-time data aggregation. For example, our top-k protocol PPTKS accurately aggregates counts for 180,000 distributed IP addresses in only a few minutes. Finally, we use SEPIA with real traffic data from 17 customers of a backbone network to collaboratively detect, analyze, and mitigate distributed anomalies. Our work follows a path starting from theory, going to system design, performance evaluation, and ending with measurement. Along this way, it makes a first effort to bridge two very disparate worlds: MPC theory and network monitoring and security practices.", "authors": [{"name": "martin burkhart", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100216447"}, {"name": "xenofontas dimitropoulos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100226473"}], "title": "Privacy-preserving distributed network troubleshooting\u2014bridging the gap between theory and practice", "citations": [{"Name": "Ang Chen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andreas Haeberlen", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "PRISM: private retrieval of the internet's sensitive metadata", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Proceedings of the 8th USENIX Conference on Cyber Security Experimentation and Test", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "p.4-4", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "August 10", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "2015", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Washington", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "D.C.\n", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "49\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "715\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "eth zurich", "city": null, "Name": "martin burkhart"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "eth zurich", "city": null, "Name": "xenofontas dimitropoulos"}]}}, "date": {"month": "December", "year": "2011"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 10": {"references": ["William Aiello , Yuval Ishai , Omer Reingold, Priced Oblivious Transfer: How to Sell Digital Goods, Proceedings of the International Conference on the Theory and Application of Cryptographic Techniques: Advances in Cryptology, p.119-135, May 06-10, 2001\n", "Bell, D.

In this article, we propose astateful anonymous credentialsystem that allows the provider to implement nontrivial, real-world access controls on oblivious protocols conducted with anonymous users. Our system models the behavior of users as a state machine and embeds that state within an anonymous credential to restrict access to resources based on the state information. The use of state machine models of user behavior allows the provider to restrict the users' actions according to a wide variety of access control models without learning anything about the users' identities or actions. Our system is secure in the standard model under basic assumptions and, after an initial setup phase, each transaction requires only constant time. As a concrete example, we show how to implement the Brewer--Nash (Chinese Wall) and Bell-La Padula (Multilevel Security) access control models within our credential system. Furthermore, we combine our credential system with an adaptive oblivious transfer scheme to create a privacy-friendly oblivious database with strong access controls.", "authors": [{"name": "scott e coull", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100563418"}, {"name": "matthew green", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329488886"}, {"name": "susan hohenberger", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81326490028"}], "title": "Access controls for oblivious and anonymous systems", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "37\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "665\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "scott e coull"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "matthew greenjohns hopkins university"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "susan hohenberger", "city": null, "Name": "susan hohenbergerjohns hopkins university"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Shweta Agrawal , Dan Boneh, Homomorphic MACs: MAC-Based Integrity for Network Coding, Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Applied Cryptography and Network Security, June 02-05, 2009, Paris-Rocquencourt, France[doi>10.1007/978-3-642-01957-9_18]\n", "Daniel Aguayo , John Bicket , Sanjit Biswas , Glenn Judd , Robert Morris, Link-level measurements from an 802.11b mesh network, ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review, v.34 n.4, October 2004[doi>10.1145/1030194.1015482]\n", "R.

The core principle of network coding is that intermediate nodes actively mix input packets to produce output packets. This mixing subjects network coding systems to a severe security threat, known as apollution attack, where attacker nodes inject corrupted packets into the network. Corrupted packets propagate in an epidemic manner, depleting network resources and significantly decreasing throughput. Pollution attacks are particularly dangerous in wireless networks, where attackers can easily inject packets or compromise devices due to the increased network vulnerability.In this article, we address pollution attacks against network coding systems in wireless mesh networks. We demonstrate that previous solutions are impractical in wireless networks, incurring an unacceptable high degradation of throughput. We propose a lightweight scheme, DART, that uses time-based authentication in combination with random linear transformations to defend against pollution attacks. We further improve system performance and propose EDART, which enhances DART with an optimistic forwarding scheme. We also propose efficient attacker identification schemes for both DART and EDART that enable quick attacker isolation and the selection of attacker-free paths, achieving additional performance improvement. A detailed security analysis shows that the probability of a polluted packet passing our verification procedure is very low (less than 0.002&percnt; in typical settings). Performance results using the well-known MORE protocol and realistic link quality measurements from the Roofnet experimental testbed show that our schemes improve system performance over 20 times compared with previous solutions.", "authors": [{"name": "jing dong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350580937"}, {"name": "reza curtmola", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319490559"}, {"name": "cristina nita-rotaru", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100166867"}], "title": "Practical defenses against pollution attacks in wireless network coding", "citations": [{"Name": "Vahid Nazari Talooki ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Riccardo Bassoli ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daniel E.

In this article we apply association rule mining to the history of accesses to predict changes to access-control policies that are likely to be consistent with users' intentions, so that these changes can be instituted in advance of misconfigurations interfering with legitimate accesses. Instituting these changes requires the consent of the appropriate administrator, of course, and so a primary contribution of our work is how to automatically determine from whom to seek consent and how to minimize the costs of doing so. We show using data from a deployed access-control system that our methods can reduce the number of accesses that would have incurred costly time-of-access delays by 43&percnt;, and can correctly predict 58&percnt; of the intended policy.

This construction is well suited for wireless broadcast communications characterized by low packet losses such as in satellite networks. Moreover, neither hardware upgrades nor specific end-user equipment are needed to enjoy the authentication services. The computation overhead experienced on the receiver only sums to two hashes per block of pictures and one digital signature verification for the whole received stream. This overhead introduces a provably negligible decrease in video quality.

Recent work in the area has considered the efficient enforcement of temporal and geo-spatial access control policies, and asymptotic results for the time and space complexity of efficient enforcement schemes have been obtained. However, for practical purposes, it is useful to have explicit bounds for the complexity of enforcement schemes.In this article we consider interval-based access control policies, of which temporal and geo-spatial access control policies are special cases. We define enforcement schemes for interval-based access control policies for which it is possible, in almost all cases, to obtain exact values for the schemes' complexity, thereby subsuming a substantial body of work in the literature. Moreover, our enforcement schemes are more practical than existing schemes, in the sense that they operate in the same way as standard cryptographic enforcement schemes, unlike other efficient schemes in the literature. The main difference between our approach and earlier work is that we develop techniques that are specific to the cryptographic enforcement of interval-based access control policies, rather than applying generic techniques that give rise to complex constructions and asymptotic bounds.", "authors": [{"name": "jason crampton", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100321506"}], "title": "Practical and efficient cryptographic enforcement of interval-based access control policies", "citations": [{"Name": "Chien-Cheng Huang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Feng-Yu Lin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Frank Yeong-Sung Lin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yeali S.

Authorization caching, which enables the reuse of previous authorization decisions, is one technique that has been used to address these challenges.This article introduces and evaluates the mechanisms for authorization \u201crecycling\u201d in RBAC enterprise systems. The algorithms that support these mechanisms allow making precise and approximate authorization decisions, thereby masking possible failures of the authorization server and reducing its load. We evaluate these algorithms analytically as well as using simulation and a prototype implementation. Our evaluation results demonstrate that authorization recycling can improve the performance of distributed-access control mechanisms.", "authors": [{"name": "qiang wei", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81542083156"}, {"name": "jason crampton", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100321506"}, {"name": "konstantin beznosov", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100388506"}, {"name": "matei ripeanu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100514914"}], "title": "Authorization recycling in hierarchical RBAC systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Jason Crampton ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Charles Morisset ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nicol Zannone", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "28\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "432\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "qiang wei"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "jason cramptonroyal holloway university of london uk"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "konstantin beznosovuniversity of british columbia vancouver bc canada"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "matei ripeanu", "city": null, "Name": "matei ripeanuuniversity of british columbia vancouver bc canada"}]}, "Article No.: 12": {"references": ["Masayuki Abe , Serge Fehr, Perfect NIZK with adaptive soundness, Proceedings of the 4th conference on Theory of cryptography, February 21-24, 2007, Amsterdam, The Netherlands\n", "Giuseppe Ateniese , Randal Burns , Reza Curtmola , Joseph Herring , Lea Kissner , Zachary Peterson , Dawn Song, Provable data possession at untrusted stores, Proceedings of the 14th ACM conference on Computer and communications security, November 02-October 31, 2007, Alexandria, Virginia, USA[doi>10.1145/1315245.1315318]\n", "Giuseppe Ateniese , Roberto Di Pietro , Luigi V.

System monitoring is necessary to ensure the reliable operation of power grids, andstate estimationis used in system monitoring to best estimate the power grid state through analysis of meter measurements and power system models. Various techniques have been developed to detect and identify bad measurements, includinginteracting bad measurementsintroduced byarbitrary, nonrandomcauses. At first glance, it seems that these techniques can also defeat malicious measurements injected by attackers.In this article, we expose an unknown vulnerability of existing bad measurement detection algorithms by presenting and analyzing a new class of attacks, calledfalse data injection attacks, against state estimation in electric power grids. Under the assumption that the attacker can access the current power system configuration information and manipulate the measurements of meters at physically protected locations such as substations, such attacks can introducearbitraryerrors into certain state variables without being detected by existing algorithms. Moreover, we look at two scenarios, where the attacker is either constrained to specific meters or limited in the resources required to compromise meters. We show that the attacker can systematically and efficiently construct attack vectors in both scenarios to change the results of state estimation inarbitraryways. We also extend these attacks togeneralized false data injection attacks, which can further increase the impact by exploiting measurement errors typically tolerated in state estimation. We demonstrate the success of these attacks through simulation using IEEE test systems, and also discuss the practicality of these attacks and the real-world constraints that limit their effectiveness.", "authors": [{"name": "yao liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81447596436"}, {"name": "peng ning", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332518403"}, {"name": "michael k reiter", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81387594159"}], "title": "False data injection attacks against state estimation in electric power grids", "citations": [{"Name": "Erik M.

Users can use Garm to attach access policies to data and Garm enforces the policy on all accesses to the data (and any derived data) across all applications and executions. Garm uses static analysis to generate optimized instrumentation that traces the provenance of an application's state and the policies that apply to this state. Garm monitors the interactions of the application with the underlying operating system to enforce policies. Conceptually, Garm combines trusted computing support from the underlying operating system with a stream cipher to ensure that data protected by an access policy cannot be accessed outside of Garm's policy enforcement mechanisms. We have evaluated Garm with several common Linux applications. We found that Garm can successfully trace the provenance of data across executions of multiple applications and enforce data access policies on the application's executions.", "authors": [{"name": "brian demsky", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100338144"}], "title": "Cross-application data provenance and policy enforcement", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "29\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "370\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Trinidad and Tobago", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california irvine ca", "city": "california", "Name": "brian demsky"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["Mart\u00edn Abadi , Michael Burrows , Butler Lampson , Gordon Plotkin, A calculus for access control in distributed systems, ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems (TOPLAS), v.15 n.4, p.706-734, Sept. 1993[doi>10.1145/155183.155225]\n", "Ofer Arieli , Arnon Avron, The value of the four values, Artificial Intelligence, v.102 n.1, p.97-141, June 1998[doi>10.1016/S0004-3702(98)00032-0]\n", "Lujo Bauer , Jay Ligatti , David Walker, Composing security policies with polymer, Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGPLAN conference on Programming language design and implementation, June 12-15, 2005, Chicago, IL, USA[doi>10.1145/1065010.1065047]\n", "Belnap, N.

Hence there is benefit in any framework for policy composition that is intuitive, formal (and so \u201canalyzable\u201d and \u201cimplementable\u201d), expressive, independent of specific application domains, and yet able to be extended to create domain-specific instances. Here we develop such a framework based on Belnap logic. An access-control policy is interpreted as afour-valuedpredicate that maps access requests to eithergrant,deny,conflict, orunspecified-- the four values of the Belnap bilattice. We define an expressive access-control policy language PBel, having composition operators based on the operators of Belnap logic. Natural orderings on policies are obtained by lifting the truth and information orderings of the Belnap bilattice. These orderings lead to a query language in which policy analyses, for example, conflict freedom, can be specified. Policy analysis is supported through a reduction of the validity of policy queries to the validity of propositional formulas on predicates over access requests. We evaluate our approach through firewall policy and RBAC policy examples, and discuss domain-specific and generic extensions of our policy language.", "authors": [{"name": "glenn bruns", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100166075"}, {"name": "michael huth", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100404997"}], "title": "Access control via belnap logic: Intuitive, expressive, and analyzable policy composition", "citations": [{"Name": "Jason Crampton ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Charles Morisset ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nicol Zannone", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Glenn Bruns ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Philip W.L.

As each source database defines its own access control policies for a set of local identities, enforcing such policies across the federation becomes a challenge. In this article, we first consider the problem of translating existing access control policies defined over source databases in a manner that allows the original semantics to be observed while becoming applicable across the entire data federation. We show that such a translation is always possible, and provide an algorithm for automating the translation. We show that verifying whether a translated policy obeys the semantics of the original access control policy defined over a source database is intractable, even under restrictive scenarios. We then describe a practical algorithmic framework for translating relational access control policies into their XML equivalent, expressed in the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language. Finally, we examine the difficulty of minimizing translated policies, and contribute a minimization algorithm applicable to nonrecursive translated policies.", "authors": [{"name": "gregory leighton", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100604514"}, {"name": "denilson barbosa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100505132"}], "title": "Access Control Policy Translation, Verification, and Minimization within Heterogeneous Data Federations", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "21\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "364\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "canada", "university": "university of alberta", "affiliation_string": "university of alberta", "city": "edmonton", "Name": "gregory leighton"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of alberta", "affiliation_string": "university of alberta", "city": "edmonton", "Name": "denilson barbosa"}]}, "Article No.: 23": {"references": ["Abrams, M., Heaney, J., King, O., LaPadula, L., Lazear, M., and Olson, I.1991.

These systems have been implemented in a variety of applications, most notably the popular Vuze BitTorrent client. Zage and Nita-Rotaru (at CCS 2007) and independently, Kaafar et al. (at SIGCOMM 2007), demonstrated that several widely-cited network coordinate systems are prone to simple attacks, and proposed mechanisms to defeat these attacks using outlier detection to filter out adversarial inputs. Kaafar et al. goes a step further and requires that a fraction of the network is trusted. More recently, Sherr et al. (at USENIX ATC 2009) proposed Veracity, a distributed reputation system to secure network coordinate systems. We describe a new attack on network coordinate systems, Frog-Boiling, that defeats all of these defenses. Thus, even a system with trusted entities is still vulnerable to attacks. Moreover, having witnesses vouch for your coordinates as in Veracity does not prevent our attack. Finally, we demonstrate empirically that the Frog-Boiling attack is more disruptive than the previously known attacks: systems that attempt to reject \u201cbad\u201d inputs by statistical means or reputation cannot be used to secure a network coordinate system.", "authors": [{"name": "eric chan-tin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81340488087"}, {"name": "victor heorhiadi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81470655338"}, {"name": "nicholas hopper", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100172412"}, {"name": "yongdae kim", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100658424"}], "title": "The Frog-Boiling Attack: Limitations of Secure Network Coordinate Systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Shining Wu ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yang Chen ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiaoming Fu ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jun Li", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "28\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "305\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "oklahoma state university", "city": null, "Name": "eric chan-tin"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of minnesota", "city": null, "Name": "victor heorhiadi"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of minnesota", "city": null, "Name": "nicholas hopper"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of minnesota", "city": null, "Name": "yongdae kim"}]}, "Article No.: 24": {"references": ["Lee Badger , Daniel F.

Traditional security models that focused on separating users from each other have proven ineffective in an environment of widespread software vulnerabilities and rampant malware. However, alternative approaches that provide more finely grained security generally require greater expertise than typical end users can reasonably be expected to have, and consequently have had limited success.The functionality-based application confinement (FBAC) model is designed to allow end users with limited expertise to assign applications hierarchical and parameterised policy abstractions based upon the functionalities each program is intended to perform. To validate the feasibility of this approach and assess the usability of existing mechanisms, a usability study was conducted comparing an implementation of the FBAC model with the widely used Linux-based SELinux and AppArmor security schemes. The results showed that the functionality-based mechanism enabled end users to effectively control the privileges of their applications with far greater success than widely used alternatives. In particular, policies created using FBAC were more likely to be enforced and exhibited significantly lower risk exposure, while not interfering with the ability of the application to perform its intended task. In addition to the success of the functionality-based approach, the usability study also highlighted a number of limitations and problems with existing mechanisms. These results indicate that a functionality-based approach has significant potential in terms of enabling end users with limited expertise to defend themselves against insecure and malicious software.", "authors": [{"name": "z cliffe schreuders", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81388601787"}, {"name": "tanya mcgill", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100092397"}, {"name": "christian payne", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81410592589"}], "title": "Empowering End Users to Confine Their Own Applications: The Results of a Usability Study Comparing SELinux, AppArmor, and FBAC-LSM", "citations": [{"Name": "Yuanzhong Xu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alan M.

However, traditional fuzz testing tools have a well-known common drawback: they are ineffective if most generated inputs are rejected at the early stage of program running, especially when target programs employ checksum mechanisms to verify the integrity of inputs. This article presents TaintScope, an automatic fuzzing system using dynamic taint analysis and symbolic execution techniques, to tackle the above problem. TaintScope has several novel features: (1) TaintScope is a checksum-aware fuzzing tool. It can identify checksum fields in inputs, accurately locate checksum-based integrity checks by using branch profiling techniques, and bypass such checks via control flow alteration. Furthermore, it can fix checksum values in generated inputs using combined concrete and symbolic execution techniques. (2) TaintScope is a taint-based fuzzing tool working at the x86 binary level. Based on fine-grained dynamic taint tracing, TaintScope identifies the \u201chot bytes\u201d in a well-formed input that are used in security-sensitive operations (e.g., invoking system/library calls), and then focuses on modifying such bytes with random or boundary values. (3) TaintScope is also a symbolic-execution-based fuzzing tool. It can symbolically evaluate a trace, reason about all possible values that can execute the trace, and then detect potential vulnerabilities on the trace.We evaluate TaintScope on a number of large real-world applications. Experimental results show that TaintScope can accurately locate the checksum checks in programs and dramatically improve the effectiveness of fuzz testing. TaintScope has already found 30 previously unknown vulnerabilities in several widely used applications, including Adobe Acrobat, Flash Player, Google Picasa, and Microsoft Paint. Most of these severe vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Secunia and oCERT, and assigned CVE identifiers (such as CVE-2009-1882, CVE-2009-2688).

Physical tamper-indicating seals can usually be easily defeated, given they way they are typically made and used; and the effectiveness of seals depends on the protocol for their application and inspection. The legitimacy of our elections may therefore depend on whether a particular state\u2019s use of seals is effective to prevent, deter, or detect election fraud. This paper is a case study of the use of seals on voting machines by the State of New Jersey. I conclude that New Jersey\u2019s protocols for the use of tamper-evident seals have been not at all effective. I conclude with a discussion of the more general problem of seals in democratic elections.", "authors": [{"name": "andrew w appel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100498630"}], "title": "Security Seals on Voting Machines: A Case Study", "citations": [{"Name": "Drew Springall ", "Country": "estonia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Travis Finkenauer ", "Country": "estonia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zakir Durumeric ", "Country": "estonia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jason Kitcat ", "Country": "estonia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Harri Hursti ", "Country": "estonia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Margaret MacAlpine ", "Country": "estonia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "J.

In contrast, new application areas are emerging that establish and rely on properties of the physical world. Examples include protocols for secure localization, distance bounding, and secure time synchronization.We present a formal model for modeling and reasoning about such physical security protocols. Our model extends standard, inductive, trace-based, symbolic approaches with a formalization of physical properties of the environment, namely communication, location, and time. In particular, communication is subject to physical constraints, for example, message transmission takes time determined by the communication medium used and the distance between nodes. All agents, including intruders, are subject to these constraints and this results in a distributed intruder with restricted, but more realistic, communication capabilities than those of the standard Dolev-Yao intruder. We have formalized our model in Isabelle/HOL and have used it to verify protocols for authenticated ranging, distance bounding, broadcast authentication based on delayed key disclosure, and time synchronization.", "authors": [{"name": "david basin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100431853"}, {"name": "srdjan capkun", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100396056"}, {"name": "patrick schaller", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384613149"}, {"name": "benedikt schmidt", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442608043"}], "title": "Formal Reasoning about Physical Properties of Security Protocols", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "77\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "544\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Switzerland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "eth zurich switzerland", "city": "zurich", "Name": "david basin"}, {"country": "Switzerland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "eth zurich switzerland", "city": "zurich", "Name": "srdjan capkun"}, {"country": "Switzerland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "eth zurich switzerland", "city": "zurich", "Name": "patrick schaller"}, {"country": "Switzerland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "eth zurich switzerland", "city": "zurich", "Name": "benedikt schmidt"}]}, "Article No.: 17": {"references": ["Adelson-Velskii, G. and Landis, E.

Persistent authenticated dictionaries (PADs) further allow queries against older versions of the structure. This research presents implementations of a variety of different PAD algorithms, some based on Merkle tree-style data structures and others based on individually signed \u201ctuple\u201d statements (with and without RSA accumulators). We present system throughput benchmarks, indicating costs in terms of time, storage, and bandwidth as well as considering how much money would be required given standard cloud computing costs. We conclude that Merkle tree PADs are preferable in cases with frequent updates, while tuple-based PADs are preferable with higher query rates. For Merkle tree PADs, red-black trees outperform treaps and skiplists. Applying Sarnak-Tarjan\u2019s versioned node strategy, with a cache of old hashes at every node, to red-black trees yields the fastest Merkle tree PAD implementation, notably using half the memory of the more commonly used mutation-free path copying strategy. For tuple PADs, although we designed and implemented an algorithm using RSA accumulators that offers constant update size, constant storage per update, constant proof size, and sublinear computation per update, we found that RSA accumulators are so expensive that they are never worthwhile. We find that other optimizations in the literature for tuple PADs are more cost-effective.", "authors": [{"name": "scott a crosby", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100255678"}, {"name": "dan s wallach", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100639714"}], "title": "Authenticated Dictionaries: Real-World Costs and Trade-Offs", "citations": [{"Name": "Jelle van den Hooff ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "M.

Typically, phish detection methods either use human-verified URL blacklists or exploit Web page features via machine learning techniques. However, the former is frail in terms of new phish, and the latter suffers from the scarcity of effective features and the high false positive rate (FP). To alleviate those problems, we propose a layered anti-phishing solution that aims at (1) exploiting the expressiveness of a rich set of features with machine learning to achieve a high true positive rate (TP) on novel phish, and (2) limiting the FP to a low level via filtering algorithms.Specifically, we proposed CANTINA+, the most comprehensive feature-based approach in the literature including eight novel features, which exploits the HTML Document Object Model (DOM), search engines and third party services with machine learning techniques to detect phish. Moreover, we designed two filters to help reduce FP and achieve runtime speedup. The first is a near-duplicate phish detector that uses hashing to catch highly similar phish. The second is a login form filter, which directly classifies Web pages with no identified login form as legitimate.We extensively evaluated CANTINA+ with two methods on a diverse spectrum of corpora with 8118 phish and 4883 legitimate Web pages. In the randomized evaluation, CANTINA+ achieved over 92&percnt; TP on unique testing phish and over 99&percnt; TP on near-duplicate testing phish, and about 0.4&percnt; FP with 10&percnt; training phish. In the time-based evaluation, CANTINA+ also achieved over 92&percnt; TP on unique testing phish, over 99&percnt; TP on near-duplicate testing phish, and about 1.4&percnt; FP under 20&percnt; training phish with a two-week sliding window. Capable of achieving 0.4&percnt; FP and over 92&percnt; TP, our CANTINA+ has been demonstrated to be a competitive anti-phishing solution.", "authors": [{"name": "guang xiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81416596695"}, {"name": "jason hong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81408598366"}, {"name": "carolyn p rose", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100481340"}, {"name": "lorrie cranor", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100472223"}], "title": "CANTINA+: A Feature-Rich Machine Learning Framework for Detecting Phishing Web Sites", "citations": [{"Name": "V.

Protecting these keys from invasive attackers, who open a device to steal its key, is a challenging problem. We propose controlled physical random functions (CPUFs) as an alternative to storing keys and describe the core protocols that are needed to use CPUFs. A physical random functions (PUF) is a physical system with an input and output. The functional relationship between input and output looks like that of a random function. The particular relationship is unique to a specific instance of a PUF, hence, one needs access to a particular PUF instance to evaluate the function it embodies. The cryptographic applications of a PUF are quite limited unless the PUF is combined with an algorithm that limits the ways in which the PUF can be evaluated; this is a CPUF. A major difficulty in using CPUFs is that you can only know a small set of outputs of the PUF\u2014the unknown outputs being unrelated to the known ones. We present protocols that get around this difficulty and allow a chain of trust to be established between the CPUF manufacturer and a party that wishes to interact securely with the PUF device. We also present some elementary applications, such as certified execution.", "authors": [{"name": "blaise gassend", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100438303"}, {"name": "marten van dijk", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100449382"}, {"name": "dwaine clarke", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100391203"}, {"name": "emina torlak", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100616499"}, {"name": "srinivas devadas", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100130021"}, {"name": "pim tuyls", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81342514317"}], "title": "Controlled physical random functions and applications", "citations": [{"Name": "Ulrich R\u00fchrmair", "Country": "slovakia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "SIMPL systems", "Country": "slovakia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ulrich R\u00fchrmair", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "SIMPL systems as a keyless cryptographic and security primitive", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "30\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "575\n", "Citation Count": "9\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "massachusetts institute of technology cambridge ma", "city": "cambridge", "Name": "blaise gassend"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "massachusetts institute of technology cambridge ma", "city": "cambridge", "Name": "marten van dijk"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "massachusetts institute of technology cambridge ma", "city": "cambridge", "Name": "dwaine clarke"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "massachusetts institute of technology cambridge ma", "city": "cambridge", "Name": "emina torlak"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "massachusetts institute of technology cambridge ma", "city": "cambridge", "Name": "srinivas devadas"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "philips research eindhoven", "city": null, "Name": "pim tuyls"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Barkley, J., Cincotta, A., Ferraiolo, D., Gavrila, S., and Kuhn, D.

It can be utilized for efficiently and effectively structuring functional roles of an organization having related access-control needs. The focus of this paper is the analysis of hybrid role hierarchies in the context of thegeneralized temporal role-based access control(GTRBAC) model that allows specification of a comprehensive set of temporal constraints on role, user-role, and role-permission assignments. We introduce the notion ofuniquely activable set(UAS) associated with a role hierarchy that indicates the access capabilities of a user resulting from his membership to a role in the hierarchy. Identifying such a role set is essential, while making an authorization decision about whether or not a user should be allowed to activate a particular combination of roles in a single session. We formally show how UAS can be determined for a hybrid hierarchy. Furthermore, within a hybrid hierarchy, various hierarchical relations may be derived between an arbitrary pair of roles. We present a set of inference rules that can be used to generate all the possible derived relations that can be inferred from a specified set of hierarchical relations and show that it issoundandcomplete. We also present an analysis of hierarchy transformations with respect to role addition, deletion, and partitioning, and show how various cases of these transformations allow the original permission acquisition and role-activation semantics to be managed. The formal results presented here provide a basis for developing efficient security administration and management tools.", "authors": [{"name": "james b d joshi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100641772"}, {"name": "elisa bertino", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409594658"}, {"name": "arif ghafoor", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100493628"}, {"name": "yue zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81317502578"}], "title": "Formal foundations for hybrid hierarchies in GTRBAC", "citations": [{"Name": "Suroop Mohan Chandran ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "J.

In addition, viral propagation is very similar in principle to the spread of rumors, information, and \u201cfads,\u201d implying that the solutions for viral propagation would also offer insights into these other problem settings. We answer these questions by developing a nonlinear dynamical system (NLDS) that accurately models viral propagation in anyarbitrarynetwork, including real and synthesized network graphs. We propose a general epidemic threshold condition for theNLDSsystem: we prove that the epidemic threshold for a network is exactly the inverse of the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. Finally, we show that below the epidemic threshold, infections die out at an exponential rate. Our epidemic threshold model subsumes many known thresholds for special-case graphs (e.g., Erd\u00f6s--R\u00e9nyi, BA powerlaw, homogeneous). We demonstrate the predictive power of our model with extensive experiments on real and synthesized graphs, and show that our threshold condition holds for arbitrary graphs. Finally, we show how to utilize our threshold condition for practical uses: It can dictate which nodes to immunize; it can assess the effects of a throttling policy; it can help us design network topologies so that they are more resistant to viruses.", "authors": [{"name": "deepayan chakrabarti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100424530"}, {"name": "yang wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81537985556"}, {"name": "chenxi wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451596916"}, {"name": "jurij leskovec", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100096826"}, {"name": "christos faloutsos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100373169"}], "title": "Epidemic thresholds in real networks", "citations": [{"Name": "Maria-Evgenia G.

This leads us to ask whether other types of passwords (e.g., graphical) are also vulnerable to dictionary attack because of users tending to choose memorable passwords. We suggest a method to predict and model a number of such classes for systems where passwords are created solely from a user's memory. We hypothesize that these classes define weak password subspaces suitable for an attack dictionary. For user-drawn graphical passwords, we apply this method with cognitive studies on visual recall. These cognitive studies motivate us to define a set ofpassword complexity factors(e.g., reflective symmetry and stroke count), which define a set of classes. To better understand the size of these classes and, thus, how weak the password subspaces they define might be, we use the \u201cDraw-A-Secret\u201d (DAS) graphical password scheme of Jermyn et al. [1999] as an example. We analyze the size of these classes for DAS under convenient parameter choices and show that they can be combined to define apparently popular subspaces that have bit sizes ranging from 31 to 41\u2014a surprisingly small proportion of the full password space (58 bits). Our results quantitatively support suggestions that user-drawn graphical password systems employ measures, such as graphical password rules or guidelines and proactive password checking.", "authors": [{"name": "p c van oorschot", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452617957"}, {"name": "julie thorpe", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81315492475"}], "title": "On predictive models and user-drawn graphical passwords", "citations": [{"Name": "N.

This architecture makes services more vulnerable to internal attacks coming from compromised nodes that behave arbitrarily to disrupt the network, also referred to as Byzantine attacks. In this work, we examine the impact of several Byzantine attacks performed by individual or colluding attackers. We propose ODSBR, the first on-demand routing protocol for ad hoc wireless networks that provides resilience to Byzantine attacks caused by individual or colluding nodes. The protocol uses an adaptive probing technique that detects a malicious link after lognfaults have occurred, wherenis the length of the path. Problematic links are avoided by using a route discovery mechanism that relies on a new metric that captures adversarial behavior. Our protocol never partitions the network and bounds the amount of damage caused by attackers. We demonstrate through simulations ODSBR's effectiveness in mitigating Byzantine attacks. Our analysis of the impact of these attacks versus the adversary's effort gives insights into their relative strengths, their interaction, and their importance when designing multihop wireless routing protocols.", "authors": [{"name": "baruch awerbuch", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100453798"}, {"name": "reza curtmola", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319490559"}, {"name": "david holmer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81406601037"}, {"name": "cristina nita-rotaru", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100166867"}, {"name": "herbert rubens", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81342509512"}], "title": "ODSBR: An on-demand secure Byzantine resilient routing protocol for wireless ad hoc networks", "citations": [{"Name": "Jing Dong ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kurt E.

Different data encryption and key dissemination schemes have been proposed to serve this purpose. By compiling the access-control rules into the encryption process, all these methods suffer from a static way of sharing data. With the emergence of hardware security elements on client devices, more dynamic client-based access-control schemes can be devised. This paper proposes a tamper-resistant client-based XML access-right controller supporting flexible and dynamic access-control policies. The access-control engine is embedded in a hardware-secure device and, therefore, must cope with specific hardware resources. This engine benefits from a dedicated index to quickly converge toward the authorized parts of a potentially streaming XML document. Pending situations (i.e., where data delivery is conditioned by predicates, which apply to values encountered afterward in the document stream) are handled gracefully, skipping, whenever possible the pending elements and reassembling relevant parts when the pending situation is solved. Additional security mechanisms guarantee that (1) the input document is protected from any form of tampering and (2) no forbidden information can be gained by replay attacks on different versions of the XML document and of the access-control rules. Performance measurements on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. Finally, the paper reports on two experiments conducted with a prototype running on a secured hardware platform.", "authors": [{"name": "luc bouganim", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100097676"}, {"name": "francois dang ngoc", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100632167"}, {"name": "philippe pucheral", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100584974"}], "title": "Dynamic access-control policies on XML encrypted data", "citations": [{"Name": "A.

Versioned XML documents provide us with valuable information on dependencies between document nodes, but, at the same time, presenting the risk of undesirable data disclosure. In this article, we introduce the notion of relevancy-based access control, which realizes protection of versioned XML documents by various types of relevancy, such as version dependencies, schema similarities, and temporal proximity. We define a new path query language XVerPath over XML document versions, which can be utilized for specifying relevancy-based access-control policies. We also introduce the notion of relevancy class, for collectively and compactly specifying relevancy-based policies. Regarding efficient processing of access requests, we propose the packed version model, which realizes space-efficient difference-based archives of versioned XML documents and, at the same time, providing efficient evaluation of XVerPath queries. Experimental results show reasonable performance superiority over conventional methods, which do not utilize version differences.", "authors": [{"name": "mizuho iwaihara", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100561693"}, {"name": "ryotaro hayashi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81546065756"}, {"name": "somchai chatvichienchai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100095079"}, {"name": "chutiporn anutariya", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100599123"}, {"name": "vilas wuwongse", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100375655"}], "title": "Relevancy-based access control and its evaluation on versioned XML documents", "citations": [{"Name": "Hong Zhu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kevin L\u00fc ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Renchao Jin", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "A practical mandatory access control model for XML databases", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "13\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "713\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "japan", "university": "kyoto university", "affiliation_string": "kyoto university kyoto japan", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "mizuho iwaihara"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "kyoto university", "affiliation_string": "kyoto university kyoto japan", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "ryotaro hayashi"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "siebold university of nagasaki", "affiliation_string": "siebold university of nagasaki nagasaki japan", "city": "nagasaki", "Name": "somchai chatvichienchai"}, {"country": "thailand", "university": "shinawatra university", "affiliation_string": "shinawatra university thailand", "city": "pathum thani", "Name": "chutiporn anutariya"}, {"country": "thailand", "university": "asian institute of technology", "affiliation_string": "asian institute of technology thailand", "city": "pathum thani", "Name": "vilas wuwongse"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/1210263.1216576", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "gail-joon ahn", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81536995956"}], "title": "Guest editorial: Special issue on access control models and technologies", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "16\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "385\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": []}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Allen, J., Christie, A., Fithen, W., McHugh, J., Pickel, J., and Stoner, E. 1999.

Many of these alerts are logically involved in a single multi-stage intrusion incident and a security officer often wants to analyze the complete incident instead of each individual simple alert. This paper proposes a well-structured model that abstracts the logical relation between the alerts in order to support automatic correlation of those alerts involved in the same intrusion. The basic building block of the model is a logical formula called acapability. We usecapabilityto abstract consistently and precisely all levels of accesses obtained by the attacker in each step of a multistage intrusion. We then derive inference rules to define logical relations between different capabilities. Based on the model and the inference rules, we have developed several novel alert correlation algorithms and implemented a prototype alert correlator. The experimental results of the correlator using several intrusion datasets demonstrate that the approach is effective in both alert fusion and alert correlation and has the ability to correlate alerts of complex multistage intrusions. In several instances, the alert correlator successfully correlated more than two thousand Snort alerts involved in massive scanning incidents. It also helped us find two multistage intrusions that were missed in auditing by the security officers.", "authors": [{"name": "jingmin zhou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309506603"}, {"name": "mark heckman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100623163"}, {"name": "brennen reynolds", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323495370"}, {"name": "adam carlson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100379172"}, {"name": "matt bishop", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100206408"}], "title": "Modeling network intrusion detection alerts for correlation", "citations": [{"Name": "P.

Even if some approaches have already been proposed either in the context of geographic database systems or context-aware applications, a comprehensive framework, general and flexible enough to deal with spatial aspects in real mobile applications, is still missing. In this paper, we make one step toward this direction and present GEO-RBAC, an extension of the RBAC model enhanced with spatial-and location-based information. In GEORBAC, spatial entities are used to model objects, user positions, and geographically bounded roles. Roles are activated based on the position of the user. Besides a physical position, obtained from a given mobile terminal or a cellular phone, users are also assigned a logical and device-independent position, representing the feature (the road, the town, the region) in which they are located. To enhance flexibility and reusability, we also introduce the concept of role schema, specifying the name of the role, as well as the type of the role spatial boundary and the granularity of the logical position. We then extend GEO-RBAC to support hierarchies, modeling permission, user, and activation inheritance, and separation of duty constraints. The proposed classes of constraints extend the conventional ones to deal with different granularities (schema/instance level) and spatial information.

In this paper, we presentPretty Secure BGP (psBGP)---a proposal for securing BGP, including an architectural overview, design details for significant aspects, and preliminary security and operational analysis. psBGP differs from other security proposals (e.g., S-BGP and soBGP) in that it makes use of a single-level PKI for AS number authentication, a decentralized trust model for verifying the propriety of IP prefix origin, and a rating-based stepwise approach for AS_PATH (integrity) verification. psBGP trades off the strong security guarantees of S-BGP for presumed-simpler operation, e.g., using a PKI with a simple structure, with a small number of certificate types, and of manageable size. psBGP is designed to successfully defend against various (nonmalicious and malicious) threats from uncoordinated BGP speakers, and to be incrementally deployed with incremental benefits.", "authors": [{"name": "pc van oorschot", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452617957"}, {"name": "tao wan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100388367"}, {"name": "evangelos kranakis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100397637"}], "title": "On interdomain routing security and pretty secure BGP (psBGP)", "citations": [{"Name": "Bezawada Bruhadeshwar ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sandeep S.

A natural extension to this cryptographic method is to consider a pool of participants exchanging a shared secret value and to provide a formal treatment for it. Starting from the famous two-party Diffie--Hellman (DH) key-exchange protocol and from its authenticated variants, security experts have extended it to the multiparty setting for over a decade and, in the past few years, completed a formal analysis in the framework of modern cryptography.

Although, to date several trust negotiation systems have been proposed, none of them fully address the problem of privacy preservation. Today, privacy is one of the major concerns of users when exchanging information through the Web and thus we believe that trust negotiation systems must effectively address privacy issues in order to be widely applicable. For these reasons, in this paper, we investigate privacy in the context of trust negotiations. We propose a set of privacy-preserving features for inclusion in any trust negotiation system, such as the support for the P3P standard, as well as a number of innovative features, such as a novel format for encoding digital credentials specifically designed for preserving privacy. Further, we present a variety of interoperable strategies to carry on the negotiation with the aim of improving both privacy and efficiency.", "authors": [{"name": "a squicciarini", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319501771"}, {"name": "e bertino", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409594658"}, {"name": "elena ferrari", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339498938"}, {"name": "f paci", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314485054"}, {"name": "b thuraisingham", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100621824"}], "title": "PP-trust-X: A system for privacy preserving trust negotiations", "citations": [{"Name": "David Bauer ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Douglas M.

In this paper, we formally analyze this protocol in the applied pi calculus (partly in terms of observational equivalences and partly with the assistance of an automatic protocol verifier). We treat JFK's core security properties and also other properties that are rarely articulated and rigorously studied, such as plausible deniability and resistance to denial-of-service attacks. In the course of this analysis, we found some ambiguities and minor problems, such as limitations in identity protection, but we mostly obtain positive results about JFK. For this purpose, we develop ideas and techniques that should be more generally useful in the specification and verification of security protocols.", "authors": [{"name": "martin abadi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100547147"}, {"name": "bruno blanchet", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100497004"}, {"name": "cedric fournet", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100547450"}], "title": "Just fast keying in the pi calculus", "citations": [{"Name": "Shahram Rahimi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rishath A.

The WS-Security standard defines basic mechanisms to secure SOAP traffic, one message at a time. For typical web services, however, using WS-Security independently for each message is rather inefficient; moreover, it is often important to secure the integrity of a whole session, as well as each message. To these ends, recent specifications provide further SOAP-level mechanisms. WS-SecureConversation definessecurity contexts, which can be used to secure sessions between two parties. WS-Trust specifies how security contexts are issued and obtained. We develop a semantics for the main mechanisms of WS-Trust and WS-SecureConversation, expressed as a library for TulaFale, a formal scripting language for security protocols. We model typical protocols relying on these mechanisms and automatically prove their main security properties. We also informally discuss some pitfalls and limitations of these specifications.", "authors": [{"name": "karthikeyan bhargavan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100070918"}, {"name": "ricardo corin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81381594823"}, {"name": "cedric fournet", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100547450"}, {"name": "andrew d gordon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100037731"}], "title": "Secure sessions for Web services", "citations": [{"Name": "Karthikeyan Bhargavan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "C\u00e9dric Fournet ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andrew D.

A static SoD (SSoD) policy states that in order to have all permissions necessary to complete a sensitive task, the cooperation of at least a certain number of users is required. Role-based access control (RBAC) is today's dominant access-control model. It is widely believed that one of RBAC's main strengths is that it enables the use of constraints to support policies, such as separation-of-duty. In the literature on RBAC, statically mutually exclusive roles (SMER) constraints are used to enforce SSoD policies. In this paper, we formulate and study fundamental computational problems related to the use of SMER constraints to enforce SSoD policies. We show that directly enforcing SSoD policies is intractable (coNP-complete), while checking whether an RBAC state satisfies a set of SMER constraints is efficient; however, verifying whether a given set of SMER constraints enforces an SSoD policy is also intractable (coNP-complete). We discuss the implications of these results. We show also how to generate SMER constraints that are as accurate as possible for enforcing an SSoD policy.", "authors": [{"name": "ninghui li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100475364"}, {"name": "mahesh v tripunitara", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100295811"}, {"name": "ziad bizri", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100577090"}], "title": "On mutually exclusive roles and separation-of-duty", "citations": [{"Name": "Guneshi T.

We give soundness and completeness proofs forRCL 2000relative to a restricted form of first-order predicate logic. Also, we show how previously identified role-based authorization constraints such as separtation of duty (SOD) can be expressed in our language. Moreover, we show there are other significant SOD properties that have not been previously identified in the literature. Our work shows that there are many alternate formulations of even the simplest SOD properties, with varying degree of flexibility and assurance.

More recently, researchers have developed far more decentralized intrusion detection systems using a variety of techniques. Such systems often rely upon data sharing between sites which do not have a common administrator and therefore cooperation will be required in order to detect and respond to security incidents. It has therefore become important to address cooperation and data sharing in a formal manner.In this paper, we discuss the detection of distributed attacks across cooperating enterprises. We begin by defining relationships between  cooperative hosts, then use the take-grant model to identify both when a host could identify a widespread attack and when that host is at increased risk due to data sharing. We further refine our definition of potential identification using access, integrity, and cooperation policies which limit sharing. Finally, we include a brief description of both a simple Prolog model encorporating data sharing policies and a prototype cooperative intrusion detection system.", "authors": [{"name": "deborah frincke", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100081133"}], "title": "Balancing cooperation and risk in intrusion detection", "citations": [{"Name": "Alexander D.

An important requirement is that an intrusion detection system beeffective; that is, it should detect a substantial percentage of intrusions into the supervised system, while still keeping the false alarm rate at an acceptable level. This article demonstrates that, for a reasonable set of assumptions, the false alarm rate is the limiting factor for the performance of an intrusion detection system. This is due to the base-rate fallacy phenomenon, that in order to achieve substantial values of the Bayesian detection rateP(Intrusion***Alarm), we have to achieve a (perhaps in some cases unattainably) low false alarm rate. A selection of reports of intrusion detection performance are reviewed,  and the conclusion is reached that there are indications that at least some types of intrusion detection have far to go before they can attain such low false alarm rates.", "authors": [{"name": "stefan axelsson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100196481"}], "title": "The base-rate fallacy and the difficulty of intrusion detection", "citations": [{"Name": "Miles McQueen ", "Country": "switzerland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Annarita Giani", "Country": "switzerland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bogdan D.

In these applications the number of encrypted TV programs may be very large, but the secure memory capacity at the set-top terminals (STT) is severely limited due to the need to withstand pirate attacks and hardware tampering. Despite this, we would like to allow the service provider to offer different packages of programs to the users. A user who buys a package should be able to view every program belonging to that package, but nothing else. A flexible scheme should allow for packages of various sizes to be offered, from a single program up to all the programs. We suggest two novel schemes to manage the encryption keys for these applications. The schemes are highly flexible, and understandable to users, yet require very few keys to be stored in the STTs' secure memory. The computational power required of the STTs is very low. The security of these schems is as good or better than that offered by current technology.", "authors": [{"name": "avishai wool", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100392574"}], "title": "Key management for encrypted broadcast", "citations": [{"Name": "Roberto Di Pietro ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Luigi V.

This system is already in very wide deployment in Europe and has recently been adopted as part of the American digital television standard. Our analyses of the specifications, and of real systems implementing them, show that the broadband and broadcast systems are combined insecurely. This enables a large-scale exploitation technique with a localized geographical footprint based on Radio Frequency (RF) injection, which requires a minimal budget and infrastructure and is remarkably difficult to detect. In this article, we present the attack methodology and a number of follow-on exploitation techniques that provide significant flexibility to attackers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the technical complexity and required budget are low, making this attack practical and realistic, especially in areas with high population density: In a dense urban area, an attacker with a budget of about 450 can target more than 20,000 devices in a single attack. A unique aspect of this attack is that, in contrast to most Internet of Things/Cyber-Physical System threat scenarios, where the attack comes from the data network side and affects the physical world, our attack uses the physical broadcast network to attack the data network.", "authors": [{"name": "yossef oren", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339520679"}, {"name": "angelos d keromytis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100083417"}], "title": "Attacking the Internet Using Broadcast Digital Television", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "291\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "24\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "291\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Netherlands", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "network security lab columbia university amsterdam avenue new york ny usa", "city": "amsterdam", "Name": "yossef oren"}, {"country": "Netherlands", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "network security lab columbia university amsterdam avenue new york ny usa", "city": "amsterdam", "Name": "angelos d keromytis"}]}, "Article No.: 15": {"references": ["Aris Anagnostopoulos , Michael T.

In the Provable Data Possession (PDP) model, the client preprocesses the data and then sends them to an untrusted server for storage while keeping a small amount of meta-data. The client later asks the server to prove that the stored data have not been tampered with or deleted (without downloading the actual data). However, existing PDP schemes apply only to static (or append-only) files. We present a definitional framework and efficient constructions for Dynamic Provable Data Possession (DPDP), which extends the PDP model to support provable updates to stored data. We use a new version of authenticated dictionaries based on rank information. The price of dynamic updates is a performance change fromO(1) toO(logn(orO(n\u03b5logn)) for a file consisting ofnblocks while maintaining the same (or better, respectively) probability of misbehavior detection. Our experiments show that this slowdown is very low in practice (e.g., 415KB proof size and 30ms computational overhead for a 1GB file). We also show how to apply our DPDP scheme to outsourced file systems and version control systems (e.g., CVS).", "authors": [{"name": "c chris erway", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100315409"}, {"name": "alptekin kupcu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367594693"}, {"name": "charalampos papamanthou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100171688"}, {"name": "roberto tamassia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100005178"}], "title": "Dynamic Provable Data Possession", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "471\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "63\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "471\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "c chris erway"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "alptekin kupcukoc university istanbul turkey"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "charalampos papamanthouece and umiacs university of maryland college park md usa"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "roberto tamassia"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Bogdan Alexe, Thomas Deselaers, and Vittorio Ferrari. 2012.

In particular, the newly on market Microsoft Windows 8\u2122 operating system adopts such an alternative authentication to complement its traditional text-based authentication. We present an empirical analysis of picture gesture authentication on more than 10,000 picture passwords collected from more than 800 subjects through online user studies. Based on the findings of our user studies, we propose a novel attack framework that is capable of cracking passwords on previously unseen pictures in a picture gesture authentication system.

In performance attacks, malicious nodes deviate from the protocol when sending or creating messages, with the goal of degrading system performance. We identify a representative set of basic malicious message delivery and lying actions and design a greedy search algorithm that finds effective attacks consisting of a subset of these actions. Although lying malicious actions are protocol dependent, requiring the format and meaning of messages, Gatling captures them without needing to modify the target system by using a type-aware compiler. We have implemented and used Gatling on nine systems, a virtual coordinate system, a distributed hash table lookup service and application, two multicast systems and one file sharing application, and three secure systems designed specifically to tolerate insiders, two based on virtual coordinates and one using Outlier Detection, one invariant derived from physical laws, and the last one a Byzantine resilient replication system. We found a total of 48 attacks, with the time needed to find each attack ranging from a few minutes to a few hours.", "authors": [{"name": "hyojeong lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418595324"}, {"name": "jeff seibert", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81466643080"}, {"name": "dylan fistrovic", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658712913"}, {"name": "charles killian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452615019"}, {"name": "cristina nita-rotaru", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100166867"}], "title": "Gatling: Automatic Performance Attack Discovery in Large-Scale Distributed Systems", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "187\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "15\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "187\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "purdue university ca", "city": null, "Name": "hyojeong lee"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "purdue university ca", "city": null, "Name": "jeff seibert"}, {"country": "Cameroon", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "purdue university west lafayette in", "city": "west", "Name": "dylan fistrovic"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "purdue university ca", "city": null, "Name": "charles killian"}, {"country": "Cameroon", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "purdue university west lafayette in", "city": "west", "Name": "cristina nita-rotaru"}]}}, "date": {"month": "April", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Alfred V.

Although some models have been proposed for enforcingpurpose-based privacy policies, little has been done in defining formal semantics for purpose, and therefore an effective enforcement mechanism for such policies has remained a challenge. We have developed a framework for expressing and enforcing such policies by giving a formal definition of purpose and proposing a modal-logic language for formally expressing purpose constraints. The semantics of this language are defined over an abstract model ofworkflows. Based on this formal framework, we discuss some properties of purpose, show how common forms of purpose constraints can be formalized, how purpose-based constraints can be connected to more general access control policies, and how they can be enforced in a workflow-based information system by extending common access control technologies.", "authors": [{"name": "mohammad jafari", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442611163"}, {"name": "reihaneh safavi-naini", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309493710"}, {"name": "philip w l fong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100096354"}, {"name": "ken barker", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100377273"}], "title": "A Framework for Expressing and Enforcing Purpose-Based Privacy Policies", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "139\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "12\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "407\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "canada", "university": "university of calgary", "affiliation_string": "university of calgary", "city": "calgary", "Name": "mohammad jafari"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of calgary", "affiliation_string": "university of calgary", "city": "calgary", "Name": "reihaneh safavi-naini"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of calgary", "affiliation_string": "university of calgary", "city": "calgary", "Name": "philip w l fong"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of calgary", "affiliation_string": "university of calgary", "city": "calgary", "Name": "ken barker"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["O.

It is, however, often not possible to anticipate all subjects that should be permitted access and the conditions under which they should be permitted. For example, predicting and correctly encoding all emergency and exceptional situations is impractical. Traditional access control models simply deny all requests that are not permitted, and in doing so may cause unpredictable and unacceptable consequences. To overcome this issue, break-glass access control models permit a subject to override an access control denial if he accepts a set of obligatory actions and certain override conditions are met. Existing break-glass models are limited in how the override decision is specified. They either grant overrides for a predefined set of exceptional situations, or they grant unlimited overrides to selected subjects, and as such, they suffer from the difficulty of correctly encoding and predicting all override situations and permissions. To address this, we develop Rumpole, a novel break-glass language that explicitly represents and infersknowledge gapsandknowledge conflictsabout the subject's attributes and the contextual conditions, such as emergencies. For example, a Rumpole policy can distinguish whether or not it is known that an emergency holds. This leads to a more informed decision for an override request, whereas current break-glass languages simply assume that there is no emergency if the evidence for it is missing. To formally define Rumpole, we construct a novel many-valued logic programming language called Beagle. It has a simple syntax similar to that of Datalog, and its semantics is an extension of Fitting's bilattice-based semantics for logic programs.

Most enterprise security managers today simply patch the most dangerous vulnerabilities\u2014an adversary can thus easily compromise an enterprise by using less important vulnerabilities to penetrate an enterprise. In this article, we capture the vulnerabilities in an enterprise as a Vulnerability Dependency Graph (VDG) and show that attacks graphs can be expressed in them. We first ask the question: What set of vulnerabilities should an attacker exploit in order to maximize his expected impact&quest; We show that this problem can be solved as an integer linear program. The defender would obviously like to minimize the impact of the worst-case attack mounted by the attacker\u2014but the defender also has an obligation to ensure a high productivity within his enterprise. We propose an algorithm that finds a Pareto-optimal solution for the defender that allows him to simultaneously maximize productivity and minimize the cost of patching products on the enterprise network. We have implemented this framework and show that runtimes of our computations are all within acceptable time bounds even for large VDGs containing 30K edges and that the balance between productivity and impact of attacks is also acceptable.", "authors": [{"name": "edoardo serra", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453617297"}, {"name": "sushil jajodia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100609407"}, {"name": "andrea pugliese", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100366308"}, {"name": "antonino rullo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658626596"}, {"name": "v s subrahmanian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314485824"}], "title": "Pareto-Optimal Adversarial Defense of Enterprise Systems", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "300\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "21\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "300\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland college parkmd20742 usa", "city": null, "Name": "edoardo serra"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "george mason university fairfax va usa", "city": null, "Name": "sushil jajodia"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of calabria", "affiliation_string": "university of calabria italia", "city": "cosenza", "Name": "andrea pugliese"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of calabria", "affiliation_string": "university of calabria italia", "city": "cosenza", "Name": "antonino rullo"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland", "city": null, "Name": "v s subrahmanian"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. 2013.

Authorship attribution is the study of identifying the actual author of the given anonymous documents based on the text itself, and for decades, many linguistic stylometry and computational techniques have been extensively studied for this purpose. However, most of the previous research emphasizes promoting the authorship attribution accuracy, and few works have been done for the purpose of constructing and visualizing the evidential traits. In addition, these sophisticated techniques are difficult for cyber investigators or linguistic experts to interpret. In this article, based on the End-to-End Digital Investigation (EEDI) framework, we propose a visualizable evidence-driven approach, namely VEA, which aims at facilitating the work of cyber investigation. Our comprehensive controlled experiment and the stratified experiment on the real-life Enron email dataset demonstrate that our approach can achieve even higher accuracy than traditional methods; meanwhile, its output can be easily visualized and interpreted as evidential traits. In addition to identifying the most plausible author of a given text, our approach also estimates the confidence for the predicted result based on a given identification context and presents visualizable linguistic evidence for each candidate.", "authors": [{"name": "steven h h ding", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658692957"}, {"name": "benjamin c m fung", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81327488637"}, {"name": "mourad debbabi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100547285"}], "title": "A Visualizable Evidence-Driven Approach for Authorship Attribution", "citations": [{"Name": "Michael R.

In this article, we introduce several contributions to jamming mitigation. In particular, we introduce a novel adversary model that has both (unlimited) jamming reactive capabilities as well as powerful (but limited) proactive jamming capabilities. Under this adversary model, to the best of our knowledge more powerful than any other adversary model addressed in the literature, the communication bandwidth provided by current anti-jamming solutions drops to zero. We then present Silence is Golden (SiG): a novel anti-jamming protocol that, introducing a tunable, asymmetric communication channel, is able to mitigate the adversary capabilities, enabling the parties to communicate. For instance, withSiGit is possible to deliver a 128-bits-long message with a probability greater than 99&percnt; in 4096 time slots despite the presence of a jammer that jams all on-the-fly communications and 74&percnt; of the silent radio spectrum\u2014while competing proposals simply fail. Moreover, whenSiGis used in a scenario in which the adversary can jam only a subset of all the available frequencies, performance experiences a boost: a 128-bits-long message is delivered within just 17 time slots for an adversary able to jam 90&percnt; of the available frequencies. We present a thorough theoretical analysis for the solution, which is supported by extensive simulation results, showing the viability of our proposal.", "authors": [{"name": "roberto di pietro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474702073"}, {"name": "gabriele oligeri", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81466647511"}], "title": "Silence is Golden: Exploiting Jamming and Radio Silence to Communicate", "citations": [{"Name": "Roberto Di Pietro ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gabriele Oligeri", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "226\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "15\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "226\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "France", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "bell labs paris france", "city": "paris", "Name": "roberto di pietro"}, {"country": "Italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "department of mathematics and physics universita di roma tre rome italy", "city": "rome", "Name": "gabriele oligeri"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 8": {"references": ["Johan Agat, Transforming out timing leaks, Proceedings of the 27th ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT symposium on Principles of programming languages, p.40-53, January 19-21, 2000, Boston, MA, USA[doi>10.1145/325694.325702]\n", "Aslan Askarov , Danfeng Zhang , Andrew C.

Since the master boot record must be present unencrypted in order to launch the decryption of remaining system parts, it can easily be manipulated and infiltrated by bootkits that perform keystroke logging; consequently, password-based authentication schemes become attackable. The current technological response, as enforced by BitLocker, verifies the integrity of the boot process by use of the trusted platform module. But, as we show, this countermeasure is insufficient in practice. We present STARK, the first tamperproof authentication scheme thatmutually authenticatesthe computer and the user in order to resist keylogging during boot.

The framework\u2019s rules can be combined to specify different adversary capabilities, capturing different practically-relevant notions of key and state compromise. The resulting adversary models generalize the models currently used in different domains, such as security models for authenticated key exchange. We extend an existing security-protocol analysis tool, Scyther, with our adversary models. This extension systematically supports notions such as weak perfect forward secrecy, key compromise impersonation, and adversaries capable of state-reveal queries. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of a protocol-security hierarchy, which classifies the relative strength of protocols against different adversaries.In case studies, we use Scyther to analyse protocols and automatically construct protocol-security hierarchies in the context of our adversary models. Our analysis confirms known results and uncovers new attacks. Additionally, our hierarchies refine and correct relationships between protocols previously reported in the cryptographic literature.", "authors": [{"name": "david basin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100431853"}, {"name": "cas cremers", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350574493"}], "title": "Know Your Enemy: Compromising Adversaries in Protocol Analysis", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "115\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "11\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "326\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "eth zurich", "city": null, "Name": "david basin"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of oxford", "affiliation_string": "university of oxford", "city": "oxford", "Name": "cas cremers"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Serge Abiteboul , Richard Hull , Victor Vianu, Foundations of Databases: The Logical Level, Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc., Boston, MA, 1995\n", "Guido Bertoni , Luca Breveglieri , Matteo Venturi, ECC Hardware Coprocessors for 8-bit Systems and Power Consumption Considerations, Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations, p.573-574, April 10-12, 2006[doi>10.1109/ITNG.2006.55]\n", "Seyit A. \u00c7amtepe and B\u00fclent Yener. 2005.

Specifically, we demonstrate a weak attacker intercepting more than 80&percnt; of the data between peers and causing over 94&percnt; loss rate.We show that our attacks are practical through experimental validation on popular industrial and open-source products, with realistic network setups that involve NAT or tunneling and include concurrent legitimate traffic as well as packet losses. The interception attack requires a zombie agent behind the same NAT or tunnel-gateway as the victim destination; the DoS attack only requires a puppet agent, that is, a sandboxed applet or script running in web-browser context.The complexity of our attacks depends on the predictability of the IP Identification (ID) field which is typically implemented as one or multiple counters, as allowed and recommended by the IP specifications. The attacks are much simpler and more efficient for implementations, such as Windows, which use one ID counter for all destinations. Therefore, much of our focus is on presenting effective attacks for implementations, such as Linux, which use per-destination ID counters.We present practical defenses for the attacks presented in this article, the defenses can be deployed on network firewalls without changes to hosts or operating system kernel.", "authors": [{"name": "yossi gilad", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81464641351"}, {"name": "amir herzberg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100346147"}], "title": "Fragmentation Considered Vulnerable", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "64\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "417\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "bar-ilan university", "city": null, "Name": "yossi gilad"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "bar-ilan university", "city": null, "Name": "amir herzberg"}]}, "Article No.: 18": {"references": ["Ammann, P. and Sandhu, R. 1991.

Enterprise access-control systems have grown to protect tens of thousands of resources, and there is a need for verification to scale commensurately. We present techniques for abstraction-refinement and bound-estimation for bounded model checkers to automatically find errors in Administrative Role-Based Access Control (ARBAC) security policies. ARBAC is the first and most comprehensive administrative scheme for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) systems. In the abstraction-refinement portion of our approach, we identify and discard roles that are unlikely to be relevant to the verification question (the abstraction step). We then restore such abstracted roles incrementally (the refinement steps). In the bound-estimation portion of our approach, we lower the estimate of the diameter of the reachability graph from the worst-case by recognizing relationships between roles and state-change rules. Our techniques complement one another, and are used with conventional bounded model checking. Our approach is sound and complete: an error is found if and only if it exists. We have implemented our technique in an access-control policy analysis tool calledMohawk. We show empirically thatMohawkscales well to realistic policies, and provide a comparison with prior tools.", "authors": [{"name": "karthick jayaraman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435598270"}, {"name": "mahesh tripunitara", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100295811"}, {"name": "vijay ganesh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100181845"}, {"name": "martin rinard", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100087275"}, {"name": "steve chapin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100540726"}], "title": "Mohawk: Abstraction-Refinement and Bound-Estimation for Verifying Access Control Policies", "citations": [{"Name": "Jonathan Shahen ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jianwei Niu ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mahesh Tripunitara", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ping Yang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mikhail I.

These scores are subsequently compared to a fixed detection threshold and classified as either benign or malicious. We argue that a real-time ADS\u2019 input changes considerably over time and a fixed threshold value cannot guarantee good anomaly detection accuracy for such a time-varying input. In this article, we propose a simple and generic technique to adaptively tune the detection threshold of any ADS that works on threshold method. To this end, we first perform statistical and information-theoretic analysis of network- and host-based ADSs\u2019 anomaly scores to reveal a consistent time correlation structure during benign activity periods. We model the observed correlation structure using Markov chains, which are in turn used in a stochastic target tracking framework to adapt an ADS\u2019 detection threshold in accordance with real-time measurements. We also use statistical techniques to make the proposed algorithm resilient to sporadic changes and evasion attacks. In order to evaluate the proposed approach, we incorporate the proposed adaptive thresholding module into multiple ADSs and evaluate those ADSs over comprehensive and independently collected network and host attack datasets. We show that, while reducing the need of human threshold configuration, the proposed technique provides considerable and consistent accuracy improvements for all evaluated ADSs.", "authors": [{"name": "muhammad qasim ali", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81447596335"}, {"name": "ehab al-shaer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339487878"}, {"name": "hassan khan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81447598774"}, {"name": "syed ali khayam", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100402619"}], "title": "Automated Anomaly Detector Adaptation using Adaptive Threshold Tuning", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "115\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "17\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "776\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "muhammad qasim ali"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "ehab al-shaer"}, {"country": "philippines", "university": "national university", "affiliation_string": "national university of sciences and technology nust pakistan", "city": "manila", "Name": "hassan khan"}]}, "Article No.: 15": {"references": ["Antoniak, C.

We show that the techniques used to combat active attacks on the lookup mechanism dramatically increase information leaks and the efficacy of passive attacks, resulting in a tradeoff between robustness to active and passive attacks.We study this tradeoff in two P2P anonymous systems: Salsa and AP3. In both cases, we find that, by combining both passive and active attacks, anonymity can be compromised much more effectively than previously thought, rendering these systems insecure for most proposed uses. Our results hold even if security parameters are changed or other improvements to the systems are considered. Our study, therefore, shows the importance of considering these attacks in P2P anonymous communication.", "authors": [{"name": "prateek mittal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375616228"}, {"name": "nikita borisov", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100136331"}], "title": "Information Leaks in Structured Peer-to-Peer Anonymous Communication Systems", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "39\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "635\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of illinois at urbana-champaign", "city": null, "Name": "prateek mittal"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of illinois at urbana-champaign", "city": null, "Name": "nikita borisov"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2012"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Kevin Bauer , Damon McCoy , Dirk Grunwald , Tadayoshi Kohno , Douglas Sicker, Low-resource routing attacks against tor, Proceedings of the 2007 ACM workshop on Privacy in electronic society, October 29-29, 2007, Alexandria, Virginia, USA[doi>10.1145/1314333.1314336]\n", "Nikita Borisov , George Danezis , Prateek Mittal , Parisa Tabriz, Denial of service or denial of security?, Proceedings of the 14th ACM conference on Computer and communications security, November 02-October 31, 2007, Alexandria, Virginia, USA[doi>10.1145/1315245.1315258]\n", "George Danezis , Len Sassaman, Heartbeat traffic to counter (n-1) attacks: red-green-black mixes, Proceedings of the 2003 ACM workshop on Privacy in the electronic society, October 30, 2003, Washington, DC[doi>10.1145/1005140.1005154]\n", "Norman Danner , Danny Krizanc , Marc Liberatore, Detecting Denial of Service Attacks in Tor, Financial Cryptography and Data Security: 13th International Conference, FC 2009, Accra Beach, Barbados, February 23-26, 2009.

Existing stylometry research assumes that authors have not attempted to disguise their linguistic writing style. We challenge this basic assumption of existing stylometry methodologies and present a new area of research: adversarial stylometry. Adversaries have a devastating effect on the robustness of existing classification methods. Our work presents a framework for creating adversarial passages includingobfuscation, where a subject attempts to hide her identity, andimitation, where a subject attempts to frame another subject by imitating his writing style, andtranslationwhere original passages are obfuscated with machine translation services. This research demonstrates that manual circumvention methods work very well while automated translation methods are not effective. The obfuscation method reduces the techniques' effectiveness to the level of random guessing and the imitation attempts succeed up to 67&percnt; of the time depending on the stylometry technique used. These results are more significant given the fact that experimental subjects were unfamiliar with stylometry, were not professional writers, and spent little time on the attacks. This article also contributes to the field by using human subjects to empirically validate the claim of high accuracy for four current techniques (without adversaries). We have also compiled and released two corpora of adversarial stylometry texts to promote research in this field with a total of 57 unique authors. We argue that this field is important to a multidisciplinary approach to privacy, security, and anonymity.", "authors": [{"name": "michael brennan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81540593656"}, {"name": "sadia afroz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81447600288"}, {"name": "rachel greenstadt", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81340489296"}], "title": "Adversarial stylometry: Circumventing authorship recognition to preserve privacy and anonymity", "citations": [{"Name": "Steven H.

Li and Wang [2008] proposed an algebra (SoDA) for specifying SoD requirements, which is both expressive in the requirements it formalizes and abstract in that it is not bound to a workflow model. In this article, we bridge the gap between the specification of SoD constraints modeled in SoDA and their enforcement in a dynamic, service-oriented enterprise environment. We proceed by generalizing SoDA's semantics to traces, modeling workflow executions that satisfy the respective SoDA terms. We then refine the set of traces induced by a SoDA term to also account for a workflow's control-flow and role-based authorizations. Our formalization, which is based on the process algebra CSP, supports the enforcement of SoD on general workflows and handles changing role assignments during workflow execution, addressing a well-known source of fraud.The resulting CSP model serves as blueprint for a distributed and loosely coupled architecture where SoD enforcement is provisioned as a service. This concept, which we call SoD as a Service, facilitates a separation of concerns between business experts and security professionals. As a result, integration and configuration efforts are minimized and enterprises can quickly adapt to organizational, regulatory, and technological changes. We describe an implementation of SoD as a Service, which combines commercial components such as a workflow engine with newly developed components such as an SoD enforcement monitor. To evaluate our design decisions and to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we present a case study of a drug dispensation workflow deployed in a hospital.", "authors": [{"name": "david basin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100431853"}, {"name": "samuel j burri", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81464671983"}, {"name": "gunter karjoth", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100237815"}], "title": "Dynamic enforcement of abstract separation of duty constraints", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "48\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "327\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Switzerland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "eth zurich switzerland", "city": "zurich", "Name": "david basin"}, {"country": "Switzerland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "eth zurich and ibm research -- zurich switzerland", "city": "zurich", "Name": "samuel j burri"}, {"country": "Switzerland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm research -- zurich switzerland", "city": "zurich", "Name": "gunter karjoth"}]}}, "date": {"month": "November", "year": "2012"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 8": {"references": ["Mart\u00edn Abadi, Protection in Programming-Language Translations, Proceedings of the 25th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming, p.868-883, July 13-17, 1998\n", "Mart\u00edn Abadi, Secrecy by typing in security protocols, Journal of the ACM (JACM), v.46 n.5, p.749-786, Sept. 1999[doi>10.1145/324133.324266]\n", "Martin Abadi , Phillip Rogaway, Reconciling Two Views of Cryptography (The Computational Soundness of Formal Encryption), Journal of Cryptology, v.20 n.3, p.395-395, July 2007[doi>10.1007/s00145-007-0203-0]\n", "Mart\u00edn Abadi , Mihai Budiu , \u00dalfar Erlingsson , Jay Ligatti, Control-flow integrity principles, implementations, and applications, ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC), v.13 n.1, p.1-40, October 2009[doi>10.1145/1609956.1609960]\n", "Anonymous. 2002.

Recently, related studies have shown the feasibility of identifying RFID-enabled devices based on physical-layer fingerprints. In this work, we leverage on these findings and demonstrate that physical-layer identification of HF RFID devices is also practical, that is, can achieve high accuracy and stability. We propose an improved hardware setup and enhanced techniques for fingerprint extraction and matching. Our new system enables device identification with an Equal Error Rate as low as 0.005 (0.5&percnt;) on a set 50 HF RFID smart cards of the same manufacturer and type. We further investigate the fingerprint stability over an extended period of time and across different acquisition setups. In the latter case, we propose a solution based on channel equalization that preserves the fingerprint quality across setups. Our results strengthen the practical use of physical-layer identification of RFID devices in product and document anti-counterfeiting solutions.", "authors": [{"name": "boris danev", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314488282"}, {"name": "srdjan capkun", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100396056"}, {"name": "ramya jayaram masti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81504687728"}, {"name": "thomas s benjamin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81504683581"}], "title": "Towards Practical Identification of HF RFID Devices", "citations": [{"Name": "Ge Wang ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jinsong Han ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chen Qian ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Han Ding ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wei Xi", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "75\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "555\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "eth zurich", "city": null, "Name": "boris danev"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "eth zurich", "city": null, "Name": "srdjan capkun"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "eth zurich", "city": null, "Name": "ramya jayaram masti"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Advanced Network Architecture Group.2011.ANA Spoofer Project.http://spoofer.csail.mit.edu/index.php.\n", "Aharoni, M. and Hidalgo, W.

Two communicating gateways, A and B, running LOT would automatically detect each other and establish an efficient tunnel, securing communication between them. LOT tunnels allow A to discard spoofed packets that specify source addresses in B\u2019s network and vice versa. This helps to mitigate many attacks, including DNS poisoning, network scans, and most notably (Distributed) Denial of Service (DoS).LOT tunnels provide several additional defenses against DoS attacks. Specifically, since packets received from LOT-protected networks cannot be spoofed, LOT gateways implement quotas, identifying and blocking packet floods from specific networks. Furthermore, a receiving LOT gateway (e.g., B) can send the quota assigned to each tunnel to the peer gateway (A), which can then enforce near-source quotas, reducing waste and congestion by filtering excessive traffic before it leaves the source network. Similarly, LOT tunnels facilitate near-source filtering, where the sending gateway discards packets based on filtering rules defined by the destination gateway. LOT gateways also implement an intergateway congestion detection mechanism, allowing sending gateways to detect when their packets get dropped before reaching the destination gateway and to perform appropriate near-source filtering to block the congesting traffic; this helps against DoS attacks on the backbone connecting the two gateways.LOT is practical: it is easy to manage (plug and play, requires no coordination between gateways), deployed incrementally at edge gateways (not at hosts and core routers), and has negligible overhead in terms of bandwidth and processing, as we validate experimentally. LOT storage requirements are also modest.", "authors": [{"name": "yossi gilad", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81464641351"}, {"name": "amir herzberg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100346147"}], "title": "LOT: A Defense Against IP Spoofing and Flooding Attacks", "citations": [{"Name": "S.

Protecting audit logs on a physically unprotected machine in hostile environments is a challenging task, especially in the presence of active adversaries. It is critical for such a system to haveforward securityandappend-onlyproperties such that when an adversary compromises a logging machine, she cannot forge or selectively delete the log entries accumulated before the compromise. Existing public-key-based secure logging schemes are computationally costly. Existing symmetric secure logging schemes are not publicly verifiable and open to certain attacks.In this article, we develop a new forward-secure and aggregate signature scheme calledBlind-Aggregate-Forward (BAF), which is suitable for secure logging in resource-constrained systems. BAF is the only cryptographic secure logging scheme that can produce publicly verifiable, forward-secure and aggregate signatures withlow computation, key/signature storage, and signature communication overheads for the loggers, without requiring any online trusted third party support. A simple variant of BAF also allows a fine-grained verification of log entries without compromising the security or computational efficiency of BAF. We prove that our schemes are secure in Random Oracle Model (ROM). We also show that they are significantly more efficient than all the previous publicly verifiable cryptographic secure logging schemes.", "authors": [{"name": "attila a yavuz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81493650841"}, {"name": "peng ning", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332518403"}, {"name": "michael k reiter", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81387594159"}], "title": "BAF and FI-BAF: Efficient and Publicly Verifiable Cryptographic Schemes for Secure Logging in Resource-Constrained Systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Attila A.

Researchers have responded with a number of anti-phishing systems, based either on blacklists or on heuristics.

We propose a novel heuristic anti-phishing system that explicitly employs gestalt and decision theory concepts to model perceptual similarity. Our system is evaluated on three corpora contrasting legitimate Web sites with real-world phishing scams. The proposed system\u2019s performance was equal or superior to current best-of-breed systems.

Existing approaches presuppose that either the users are in possession of public key certificates issued by a trustedcertificate authority(CA), or the associated domain authentication servers share a long-term secret key. In this article, we propose a generic framework for designingfour-party password-based authenticated key exchange(4PAKE) protocols. Our framework takes a different approach from previous work. The users are not required to have public key certificates, but they simply reuse their login passwords, which they share with their respective domain authentication servers. On the other hand, the authentication servers, assumed to be part of a standard PKI, act as ephemeral CAs that certify some key materials that the users can subsequently use to exchange and agree on as a session key. Moreover, we adopt a compositional approach. That is, by treating any secure two-party password-based key exchange (2PAKE) protocol and two-party asymmetric-key/symmetric-key-based key exchange (2A/SAKE) protocol as black boxes, we combine them to obtain generic and provably secure 4PAKE protocols.", "authors": [{"name": "liqun chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=88159307257"}, {"name": "hoon wei lim", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=88159299457"}, {"name": "guomin yang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=88159164057"}], "title": "Cross-Domain Password-Based Authenticated Key Exchange Revisited", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "93\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "353\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "hp labs uk", "city": null, "Name": "liqun chen"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": "nanyang technological university", "affiliation_string": "nanyang technological university singapore", "city": "singapore", "Name": "hoon wei lim"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "university of wollongong", "affiliation_string": "university of wollongong australia", "city": "wollongong", "Name": "guomin yang"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Alexa. 2009.

As a consequence, the monitoring and analysis of DNS queries has recently been proposed as one of the most promising techniques to detect and blacklist domains involved in malicious activities (e.g., phishing, spam, botnets command-and-control, etc.). EXPOSURE is a system we designed to detect such domains in real time, by applying 15 unique features grouped in four categories.We conducted a controlled experiment with a large, real-world dataset consisting of billions of DNS requests. The extremely positive results obtained in the tests convinced us to implement our techniques and deploy it as a free, online service. In this article, we present theExposuresystem and describe the results and lessons learned from 17 months of its operation. Over this amount of time, the service detected over 100K malicious domains. The statistics about the time of usage, number of queries, and target IP addresses of each domain are also published on a daily basis on the service Web page.", "authors": [{"name": "leyla bilge", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418599738"}, {"name": "sevil sen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=88158725557"}, {"name": "davide balzarotti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100071006"}, {"name": "engin kirda", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100166085"}, {"name": "christopher kruegel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100422599"}], "title": "Exposure: A Passive DNS Analysis Service to Detect and Report Malicious Domains", "citations": [{"Name": "Reza Sharifnya ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mahdi Abadi", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "DFBotKiller", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "236\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "33\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "622\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "leyla bilge"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "sevil senhacettepe university"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "davide balzarotti"}, {"country": "china", "university": "northeastern university", "affiliation_string": "northeastern university", "city": "shenyang", "Name": "engin kirda"}, {"country": "Trinidad and Tobago", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california santa barbara", "city": "california", "Name": "christopher kruegel"}]}, "Article No.: 17": {"references": ["Mart\u00edn Abadi , Michael Burrows , Butler Lampson , Gordon Plotkin, A calculus for access control in distributed systems, ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems (TOPLAS), v.15 n.4, p.706-734, Sept. 1993[doi>10.1145/155183.155225]\n", "Dakshi Agrawal , James Giles , Kang-Won Lee , Jorge Lobo, Policy Ratification, Proceedings of the Sixth IEEE International Workshop on Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks, p.223-232, June 06-08, 2005[doi>10.1109/POLICY.2005.25]\n", "Francesco Alberti , Alessandro Armando , Silvio Ranise, Efficient symbolic automated analysis of administrative attribute-based RBAC-policies, Proceedings of the 6th ACM Symposium on Information, Computer and Communications Security, March 22-24, 2011, Hong Kong, China[doi>10.1145/1966913.1966935]\n", "Anderson, R.

Instead, our attacks rely on a weaker assumption, that the user only enters a malicious Web site, but does not download or install any application. Our attacks exploit subtle details of the TCP and HTTP specifications, and features of legitimate (and very common) browser implementations. An empirical evaluation of our techniques with current versions of browsers shows that connections with most popular Web sites are vulnerable.We conclude this work with practical client- and server-end defenses against our attacks.", "authors": [{"name": "yossi gilad", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81464641351"}, {"name": "amir herzberg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100346147"}], "title": "Off-Path TCP Injection Attacks", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "166\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "28\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "522\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "bar-ilan university", "city": null, "Name": "yossi gilad"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "bar-ilan university", "city": null, "Name": "amir herzberg"}]}}, "date": {"month": "April", "year": "2014"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Alpern, B. and Schneider, F.

We overcome limitations of Schneider\u2019s setting by distinguishing between system actions that are controllable by an enforcement mechanism and those actions that are only observable, that is, the enforcement mechanism sees them but cannot prevent their execution. For this refined setting, we give necessary and sufficient conditions on when a security policy is enforceable. To state these conditions, we generalize the standard notion of safety properties. Our classification of system actions also allows one, for example, to reason about the enforceability of policies that involve timing constraints. Furthermore, for different specification languages, we investigate the decision problem of whether a given policy is enforceable. We provide complexity results and show how to synthesize an enforcement mechanism from an enforceable policy.", "authors": [{"name": "david basin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100431853"}, {"name": "vincent juge", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502809844"}, {"name": "felix klaedtke", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100199030"}, {"name": "eugen zalinescu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81381607902"}], "title": "Enforceable Security Policies Revisited", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "119\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "619\n", "Citation Count": "6\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "eth zurich", "city": null, "Name": "david basin"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "mines paristech", "city": null, "Name": "vincent juge"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "eth zurich", "city": null, "Name": "felix klaedtke"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "eth zurich", "city": null, "Name": "eugen zalinescu"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["Mart\u00edn Abadi , Mihai Budiu , \u00dalfar Erlingsson , Jay Ligatti, Control-flow integrity, Proceedings of the 12th ACM conference on Computer and communications security, November 07-11, 2005, Alexandria, VA, USA[doi>10.1145/1102120.1102165]\n", "Periklis Akritidis , Manuel Costa , Miguel Castro , Steven Hand, Baggy bounds checking: an efficient and backwards-compatible defense against out-of-bounds errors, Proceedings of the 18th conference on USENIX security symposium, p.51-66, August 10-14, 2009, Montreal, Canada\n", "Anisimov, A. 2005.

Security requirements may impose constraints on which groups of users are permitted to perform subsets of these steps. A workflow specification is said to be satisfiable if there exists an assignment of users to workflow steps that satisfies all the constraints. An algorithm for determining whether such an assignment exists is important, both as a static analysis tool for workflow specifications and for the construction of runtime reference monitors for workflow management systems. Finding such an assignment is a hard problem in general, but work by Wang and Li [2010] using the theory of parameterized complexity suggests that efficient algorithms exist under reasonable assumptions about workflow specifications. In this article, we improve the complexity bounds for the workflow satisfiability problem. We also generalize and extend the types of constraints that may be defined in a workflow specification and prove that the satisfiability problem remains fixed-parameter tractable for such constraints. Finally, we consider preprocessing for the problem and prove that in an important special case, in polynomial time, we can reduce the given input into an equivalent one where the number of users is at most the number of steps. We also show that no such reduction exists for two natural extensions of this case, which bounds the number of users by a polynomial in the number of steps, provided a widely accepted complexity-theoretical assumption holds.", "authors": [{"name": "jason crampton", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453612638"}, {"name": "gregory gutin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81501646377"}, {"name": "anders yeo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81552904256"}], "title": "On the Parameterized Complexity and Kernelization of the Workflow Satisfiability Problem", "citations": [{"Name": "William C.

Typical applications are demonstrated using the well-known Hamming weight and Hamming distance leakage models, with recommendations for the incorporation of more accurate models. The evaluation results are empirically validated against correlation-based differential side-channel analysis attacks on two typical unprotected implementations of the Advanced Encryption Standard.", "authors": [{"name": "william e cobb", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81503688962"}, {"name": "rusty o baldwin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100156266"}, {"name": "eric d laspe", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81365596412"}], "title": "Leakage Mapping: A Systematic Methodology for Assessing the Side-Channel Information Leakage of Cryptographic Implementations", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "60\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "406\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "william e cobb"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "rusty o baldwin"}]}}, "date": {"month": "June", "year": "2013"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Foto N.

Recently also technologies that are only used under more specific circumstances have come into the spotlight of academic research and the hacker scene alike. A striking example of this is recent work [Driessen et al. 2012] that analyzed the security of the over-the-air encryption in the two existing ETSI satphone standards GMR-1 and GMR-2. The firmware of handheld devices was reverse-engineered and the previously unknown stream ciphers A5-GMR-1 and A5-GMR-2 were recovered. In a second step, both ciphers were cryptanalized, resulting in a ciphertext-only attack on A5-GMR-1 and a known-plaintext attack on A5-GMR-2.In this work, we extend the aforementioned results in the following ways: First, we improve the proposed attack on A5-GMR-1 and reduce its average-case complexity from 232to 221steps. Second, we implement a practical attack to successfully record communications in the Thuraya network and show that it can be done with moderate effort for approximately &dollar;5,000. We describe the implementation of our modified attack and the crucial aspects to make it practical. Using our eavesdropping setup, we recorded 30 seconds of our own satellite-to-satphone communication and show that we are able to recover Thuraya session keys in half an hour (on average). We supplement these results with experiments designed to highlight the feasibility of also eavesdropping on the satphone's emanations.The purpose of this article is threefold: Develop and demonstrate more practical attacks on A5-GMR-1, summarize current research results in the field of GMR-1 and GMR-2 security, and shed light on the amount of work and expertise it takes from setting out to analyze a complex system to actually break it in the real world.", "authors": [{"name": "benedikt driessen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350576826"}, {"name": "ralf hund", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81392617117"}, {"name": "carsten willems", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81381600562"}, {"name": "christof paar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100112387"}, {"name": "thorsten holz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331494833"}], "title": "An experimental security analysis of two satphone standards", "citations": [{"Name": "Imran Memon ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ibrar Hussain ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rizwan Akhtar ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gencai Chen", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Enhanced Privacy and Authentication: An Efficient and Secure Anonymous Communication for Location Based Service Using Asymmetric Cryptography Scheme", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "V.

Native-code components interoperate with Java components through the Java Native Interface (JNI). As native code is not regulated by Java's security model, it poses serious security threats to the managed Java world. We introduce a security framework that extends Java's security model and brings native code under control. Leveraging software-based fault isolation, the framework puts native code in a separate sandbox and allows the interaction between the native world and the Java world only through a carefully designed pathway. Two different implementations were built. In one implementation, the security framework is integrated into a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). In the second implementation, the framework is built outside of the JVM and takes advantage of JVM-independent interfaces. The second implementation provides JVM portability, at the expense of some performance degradation. Evaluation of our framework demonstrates that it incurs modest runtime overhead while significantly enhancing the security of Java applications.", "authors": [{"name": "mengtao sun", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84459626557"}, {"name": "gang tan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84459709857"}, {"name": "joseph siefers", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81470655382"}, {"name": "bin zeng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100630183"}, {"name": "greg morrisett", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548013278"}], "title": "Bringing java's wild native world under control", "citations": [{"Name": "Huseyin Ulusoy ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Pietro Colombo ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Elena Ferrari ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Murat Kantarcioglu ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Erman Pattuk", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andres Molina-Markham ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ronald Peterson ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Joseph Skinner ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tianlong Yun ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bhargav Golla ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kevin Freeman ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Travis Peters ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jacob Sorber ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ryan Halter ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "David Kotz", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "David Chisnall ", "Country": "turkey", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Colin Rothwell ", "Country": "turkey", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Robert N.M.

With bots now well understood to have the capacity to originate precisely timed keystroke sequences, this model of attack is likely to underestimate the threat facing a keystroke-based system in practice. In this work, we investigate how a keystroke-based authentication system would perform if it were subjected to synthetic attacks designed to mimic the typical user. To implement the attacks, we perform a rigorous statistical analysis on keystroke biometrics data collected over a 2-year period from more than 3000 users, and then use the observed statistical traits to design and launch algorithmic attacks against three state-of-the-art password-based keystroke verification systems.Relative to the zero-effort attacks typically used to test the performance of keystroke biometric systems, we show that our algorithmic attack increases the mean Equal Error Rates (EERs) of three high performance keystroke verifiers by between 28.6&percnt; and 84.4&percnt;. We also find that the impact of the attack is more pronounced when the keystroke profiles subjected to the attack are based on shorter strings, and that some users see considerably greater performance degradation under the attack than others. This article calls for a shift from the traditional zero-effort approach of testing the performance of password-based keystroke verifiers, to a more rigorous algorithmic approach that captures the threat posed by today\u2019s bots.", "authors": [{"name": "abdul serwadda", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81470655352"}, {"name": "vir v phoha", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100077846"}], "title": "Examining a Large Keystroke Biometrics Dataset for Statistical-Attack Openings", "citations": [{"Name": "Imran Memon", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Authentication User's Privacy: An Integrating Location Privacy Protection Algorithm for Secure Moving Objects in Location Based Services", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Abdul Serwadda ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Vir V.

The absence of strong security measures invites attacks on the I/O data and consequently posts threats to those services feeding on them, such as fingerprint-based biometric authentication. In this article, we present a generic solution called DriverGuard, which dynamically protects the secrecy of I/O flows such that the I/O data are not exposed to the malicious kernel. Our design leverages a composite of cryptographic and virtualization techniques to achieve fine-grained protection without using any extra devices and modifications on user applications. We implement the DriverGuard prototype on Xen by adding around 1.7K SLOC. DriverGuard is lightweight as it only needs to protect around 2&percnt; of the driver code\u2019s execution. We measure the performance and evaluate the security of DriverGuard with three input devices (keyboard, fingerprint reader and camera) and three output devices (printer, graphic card, and sound card). The experiment results show that DriverGuard induces negligible overhead to the applications.", "authors": [{"name": "yueqiang cheng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83058848657"}, {"name": "xuhua ding", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100136248"}, {"name": "robert h deng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332495895"}], "title": "DriverGuard: Virtualization-Based Fine-Grained Protection on I/O Flows", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "76\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "414\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "singapore", "university": "singapore management university", "affiliation_string": "singapore management university", "city": "singapore", "Name": "yueqiang cheng"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": "singapore management university", "affiliation_string": "singapore management university", "city": "singapore", "Name": "xuhua ding"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": "singapore management university", "affiliation_string": "singapore management university", "city": "singapore", "Name": "robert h deng"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Maurice J.

Recent advance shows that the semantic-gap can be largely narrowed by reusing the executed code from a trusted OS kernel. However, the limitation for such an approach is that it only reuses the exercised code through a training process, which suffers the code coverage issues. Thus, in this article, we present Vmst, a new technique that can seamlessly bridge the semantic gap and automatically generate the VMI tools. The key idea is that, through system wide instruction monitoring, Vmst automatically identifies the introspection related data from a secure-VM and online redirects these data accesses to the kernel memory of a product-VM, without any training. Vmst offers a number of new features and capabilities. Particularly, it enables an in-VM inspection program (e.g., ps) to automatically become an out-of-VM introspection program. We have tested Vmst with over 25 commonly used utilities on top of a number of different OS kernels including Linux and Microsoft Windows. The experimental results show that our technique is general (largely OS-independent), and it introduces 9.3X overhead for Linux utilities and 19.6X overhead for Windows utilities on average for the introspected program compared to the native in-VM execution without data redirection.", "authors": [{"name": "yangchun fu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81549547656"}, {"name": "zhiqiang lin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81549020956"}], "title": "Bridging the Semantic Gap in Virtual Machine Introspection via Online Kernel Data Redirection", "citations": [{"Name": "Yangchun Fu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Junyuan Zeng ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zhiqiang Lin", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Erick Bauman ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gbadebo Ayoade ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zhiqiang Lin", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "104\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "12\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "447\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of texas at dallas", "city": null, "Name": "yangchun fu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of texas at dallas", "city": null, "Name": "zhiqiang lin"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Anderson, J.

The security consequences of a particular architecture or access control policy are often difficult to determine, especially where some components are not under our control, where components are created dynamically, or where access policies are updated dynamically.The SERSCIS Access Modeller (SAM) takes a model of a system and explores how access can propagate through it. It can both prove defined safety properties and discover unwanted properties. By defining expected behaviours, recording the results as a baseline, and then introducing untrusted actors, SAM can discover a wide variety of design flaws.SAM is designed to handle dynamic systems (i.e., at runtime, new objects are created and access policies modified) and systems where some objects are not trusted. It extends previous approaches such as Scollar and Authodox to provide a programmer-friendly syntax for specifying behaviour, and allows modelling of services with mutually suspicious clients.Taking the Confused Deputy example from Authodox we show that SAM detects the attack automatically; using a web-based backup service, we show how to model RBAC systems, detecting a missing validation check; and using a proxy certificate system, we show how to extend it to model new access mechanisms. On discovering that a library fails to follow an RFC precisely, we re-evaluate our existing models under the new assumption and discover that the proxy certificate design is not safe with this library.", "authors": [{"name": "thomas leonard", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81361593919"}, {"name": "martin hall-may", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453659427"}, {"name": "mike surridge", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100253225"}], "title": "Modelling Access Propagation in Dynamic Systems", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "68\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "365\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of southampton", "affiliation_string": "it innovation centre university of southampton", "city": "southampton", "Name": "thomas leonard"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of southampton", "affiliation_string": "it innovation centre university of southampton", "city": "southampton", "Name": "martin hall-may"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of southampton", "affiliation_string": "it innovation centre university of southampton", "city": "southampton", "Name": "mike surridge"}]}}, "date": {"month": "September", "year": "2013"}}}, "Volume5": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Pages: 367-397": {"references": ["Julian Ashbourn, Biometrics: advanced identity verification, Springer-Verlag, London, UK, 2000\n", "Ashbourn, J. 2000b.

These features were added during the transition from Windows NT 4.0 to support the Active Directory, a new feature in Windows 2000, and to protect computers connected to the Internet. While the access control mechanisms in Windows NT are suitable for file systems and applications with simple requirements, they fall short of the needs of applications with complex data objects. Our goal was to use operating system access control mechanisms to protect a large object hierarchy with many types of objects, each with many data properties. We also wanted to reduce the exposure of users to untrustworthy or exploited programs.We introduced three extensions to support these goals. First, we extended the entries in access control lists to provide an unlimited number of access rights for a single object and to allow grouping those rights for efficiency. Second, we extended the entries to specify precisely how access control lists are assigned to each distinct type of object, instead of treating all types identically. Finally, we extended the data structure identifying users' identity to the operating system to allow users to restrict the set of objects a program may access. These changes allow a single access control mechanism to be used to protect both system and application resources, as well as protect users from each other and users from their programs, simplifying both program development and system management.", "authors": [{"name": "michael m swift", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100240419"}, {"name": "anne hopkins", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100348575"}, {"name": "peter brundrett", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100188510"}, {"name": "cliff van dyke", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100488887"}, {"name": "praerit garg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100629995"}, {"name": "shannon chan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100177220"}, {"name": "mario goertzel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100124376"}, {"name": "gregory jensenworth", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100184885"}], "title": "Improving the granularity of access control for Windows 2000", "citations": [{"Name": "Jim Longstaff ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mike Lockyer ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "John Nicholas", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yair Bartal ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alain Mayer ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kobbi Nissim ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Avishai Wool", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ted Wobber ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Aydan Yumerefendi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mart\u00edn Abadi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andrew Birrell ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daniel R.

The aim of OASIS is to allow autonomous management domains to specify their own access control policies and to interoperate subject to service level agreements (SLAs). Services define roles and implement formally specified policy to control role activation and service use; users must present the required credentials, in an appropriate context, in order to activate a role or invoke a service. All privileges are derived from roles, which are activated for the duration of a session only. In addition, a role is deactivated immediately if any of the conditions of the membership rule associated with its activation becomes false. These conditions can test the context, thus ensuring active monitoring of security.To support the management of privileges, OASIS introducesappointment. Users in certain roles are authorized to issue other users withappointment certificates, which may be a prerequisite for activating one or more roles. The conditions for activating a role at a service may include appointment certificates as well as prerequisite roles and constraints on the context. An appointment certificate does not therefore convey privileges directly but can be used as a credential for role activation. The lifetime of appointment certificates is not restricted to the issuing session, so they can be used as long-lived credentials to represent academic and professional qualification, or membership of an organization.Role-based access control (RBAC), in associating privileges with roles, provides a means of expressing access control that is scalable to large numbers of principals. However, pure RBAC associates privileges only with roles, whereas applications often require more fine-grained access control. Parametrized roles extend the functionality to meet this need.We motivate our approach and formalise OASIS. We first present the overall architecture through a basic model, followed by an extended model that includes parametrization.", "authors": [{"name": "jean bacon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100628516"}, {"name": "ken moody", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100327555"}, {"name": "walt yao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100542156"}], "title": "A model of OASIS role-based access control and its support for active security", "citations": [{"Name": "Rafae Bhatti ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Arif Ghafoor ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Elisa Bertino ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "James B.

The model takes into account the vulnerability of the information to a security breach and the potential loss should such a breach occur. It is shown that for a given potential loss, a firm should not necessarily focus its investments on information sets with the highest vulnerability. Since extremely vulnerable information sets may be inordinately expensive to protect, a firm may be better off concentrating its efforts on information sets with midrange vulnerabilities. The analysis further suggests that to maximize the expected benefit from investment to protect information, a firm should spend only a small fraction of the expected loss due to a security breach.", "authors": [{"name": "lawrence a gordon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100037167"}, {"name": "martin p loeb", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100576477"}], "title": "The economics of information security investment", "citations": [{"Name": "Kjell Hausken", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kjell Hausken", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "J.

Based on these results, an effective mechanism is proposed to control the invocation of critical, from the security viewpoint, system calls. The integration into existing UNIX operating systems is carried out by instrumenting the code of the system calls in such a way that the execution is granted only in the case where the invoking process and the value of the arguments comply with the rules held in an access control database. This method does not require changes in the kernel data structures and algorithms.

This assumption is too restrictive when access control restrictions to be enforced come from the combination of different policy specifications, each possibly under the control of independent authorities, and where the specifics of some component policies may not even be known apriori. Turning individual specifications into a coherent policy to be fed into the access control system requires a nontrivial combination and translation process. This article addresses the problem of combining authorization specifications that may be independently stated, possibly in different languages and according to different policies. We propose an algebra of security policies together with its formal semantics and illustrate how to formulate complex policies in the algebra and reason about them. A translation of policy expressions into equivalent logic programs is illustrated, which provides the basis for the implementation of the algebra. The algebra's expressiveness is analyzed through a comparison with first-order logic.", "authors": [{"name": "piero bonatti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100065041"}, {"name": "sabrina de capitani di vimercati", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100142780"}, {"name": "pierangela samarati", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100191823"}], "title": "An algebra for composing access control policies", "citations": [{"Name": "Jason Crampton ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Charles Morisset ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nicol Zannone", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Cheng-chun Shu ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Erica Y.

Gathering and disseminating information through information portals introduce new security challenges. In particular, the authorization specifications, as well as the granting process, are temporal by nature. Also, more often than not, the information provided by the portal is in fact derived from more than one backend data source. Therefore, any authorization model for information portals should support access control based on temporal characteristics of the data, and also should provide tools to prevent indirect unauthorized access through the use of derived data. In this article we focus our attention on devising such an authorization model. The distinguishing features of this model include: (1) the specification of authorizations based on temporal characteristics of data, and (2) a formal framework to derive authorizations in a consistent and safe manner, based on relationships among data.", "authors": [{"name": "vijayalakshmi atluri", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100274477"}, {"name": "avigdor gal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100568139"}], "title": "An authorization model for temporal and derived data: securing information portals", "citations": [{"Name": "Yun Bai ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Khaled M.

It is often the case that XML documents contain information of different sensitivity degrees that must be selectively shared by (possibly large) user communities. There is thus the need for models and mechanisms enabling the specification and enforcement of access control policies for XML documents. Mechanisms are also required enabling a secure and selective dissemination of documents to users, according to the authorizations that these users have. In this article, we make several contributions to the problem of secure and selective dissemination of XML documents. First, we define a formal model of access control policies for XML documents. Policies that can be defined in our model take into account both user profiles, and document contents and structures. We also propose an approach, based on an extension of the Cryptolope\u2122 approach [Gladney and Lotspiech 1997], which essentially allows one to send the same document to all users, and yet to enforce the stated access control policies. Our approach consists of encrypting different portions of the same document according to different encryption keys, and selectively distributing these keys to the various users according to the access control policies. We show that the number of encryption keys that have to be generated under our approach is minimal and we present an architecture to support document distribution.", "authors": [{"name": "elisa bertino", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409594658"}, {"name": "elena ferrari", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339498938"}], "title": "Secure and selective dissemination of XML documents", "citations": [{"Name": "Bo Luo ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dongwon Lee ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wang-Chien Lee ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Peng Liu", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "QFilter: fine-grained run-time XML access control via NFA-based query rewriting", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Proceedings of the thirteenth ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "November 08-13", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "2004", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Washington", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "D.C.", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Patrick R\u00f6der ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Omid Tafreschi ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Claudia Eckert", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "On flexible modeling of history-based access control policies for XML documents", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Proceedings of the 11th international conference", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lili Sun ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hua Wang", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "A purpose-based access control in native XML databases", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "A.

The distribution and sharing of information via the Web that must be accessed in a selective way, such as electronic commerce transactions, require the definition and enforcement of security controls, ensuring that information will be accessible only to authorized entities. Different approaches have been proposed that address the problem of protecting information in a Web system. However, these approaches typically operate at the file-system level, independently of the data that have to be protected from unauthorized accesses. Part of this problem is due to the limitations of HTML, historically used to design Web documents. The extensible markup language (XML), a markup language promoted by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), is de facto the standard language for the exchange of information on the Internet and represents an important opportunity to provide fine-grained access control. We present an access control model to protect information distributed on the Web that, by exploiting XML's own capabilities, allows the definition and enforcement of access restrictions directly on the structure and content of the documents. We present a language for the specification of access restrictions, which uses standard notations and concepts, together with a description of a system architecture for access control enforcement based on existing technology. The result is a flexible and powerful security system offering a simple integration with current solutions.", "authors": [{"name": "ernesto damiani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100103470"}, {"name": "sabrina de capitani di vimercati", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100142780"}, {"name": "stefano paraboschi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100004747"}, {"name": "pierangela samarati", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100191823"}], "title": "A fine-grained access control system for XML documents", "citations": [{"Name": "Xiaochun Yang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chen Li ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ge Yu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lei Shi", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wei Sun ", "Country": "thailand", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Da-xin Liu ", "Country": "thailand", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tong Wang", "Country": "thailand", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Two-Stage access control model for XML security", "Country": "thailand", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rafae Bhatti ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Elisa Bertino ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Arif Ghafoor ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "James B.

Such\r\nsystems raise a number of concerns when the code running in such\r\nsystems is potentially buggy or untrusted. Although sophisticated\r\naccess controls have been designed for mobile code and are shipping\r\nas part of commercial systems such as Java, there is no support for\r\nterminating mobile code short of terminating the entire language\r\nrun-time. This article presents a concept called \"soft termination\"\r\nthat can be applied to virtually any mobile code system. Soft\r\ntermination allows mobile code threads to be safely terminated\r\nwhile preserving the stability of the language run-time. In\r\naddition, function bodies can be permanently disabled, thwarting\r\nattacks predicated on system threads eventually calling untrusted\r\nfunctions. Soft termination guarantees termination by breaking any\r\npotential infinite loops in mobile code. We present a formal design\r\nfor soft termination and an implementation of it for Java, built\r\nusing Java bytecode rewriting, which demonstrates reasonable\r\nperformance (3 to 25% slowdowns onbenchmarks).", "authors": [{"name": "algis rudys", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100003188"}, {"name": "dan s wallach", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100639714"}], "title": "Termination in language-based systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Algis Rudys ", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dan S.

A timing attack is a method, recently proposed by Paul Kocher, that is designed to break cryptographic systems. It exploits the engineering aspects involved in the implementation of cryptosystems and might succeed even against cryptosys-tems that remain impervious to sophisticated cryptanalytic techniques. A timing attack is, essentially, a way of obtaining some users private information by carefully measuring the time it takes the user to carry out cryptographic operations.\nIn this work, we analyze two implementations of DES. We show that a timing attack yields the Hamming weight of the key used by both DES implementations. Moreover, the attack is computationally inexpensive. We also show that all the design characteristics of the target system, necessary to carry out the timing attack, can be inferred from timing measurements.", "authors": [{"name": "alejandro hevia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100608201"}, {"name": "marcos kiwi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100626681"}], "title": "Strength of two data encryption standard implementations under timing attacks", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "61\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "1652\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Paraguay", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "univ of chile santiago chile", "city": "santiago", "Name": "alejandro hevia"}, {"country": "Paraguay", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "univ of chile santiago chile", "city": "santiago", "Name": "marcos kiwi"}]}, "Pages: 390-415": {"references": ["1998.

The setting is such that clients reside on a particular subnet (e.g., corporate intranet, ISP) and the servers reside anywhere on the Internet. The Janus engine allows each client-server relationship to use either weak or strong authentication on each interaction. At the same time, each interaction preserves privacy by neither revealing a clients true identity (except for the subnet) nor the set of servers with which a particular client interacts. Furthermore, clients do not need any secure long-term memory, enabling scalability and mobility. The interaction model extends to allow servers to send data back to clients via e-mail at a later date. Hence, our results complement the functionality of current network anonymity tools and remailers. The paper also describes the design and implementation of the Lucent Personalized Web Assistant (LPWA), which is a practical system that provides secure and pseudonymous relations with multiple servers on the Internet. LPWA employs the Janus function to generate site-specific person\u0091, which consist of alias usernames, passwords, and e-mail addresses.", "authors": [{"name": "eran gabber", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100096278"}, {"name": "phillip b gibbons", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339501335"}, {"name": "david m kristol", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100522333"}, {"name": "yossi matias", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100094018"}, {"name": "alain mayer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100133123"}], "title": "On secure and pseudonymous client-relationships with multiple servers", "citations": [{"Name": "Assaf Ben-David ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Omer Berkman ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yossi Matias ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sarvar Patel ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Cem Paya ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Moti Yung", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ming Lei ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yang Xiao ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Susan V.

RBAC's motivation is to simplify administration of authorizations. An appealing possibility is to use RBAC itself to manage RBAC, to further provide administrative convenience and scalability, especially in decentralizing administrative authority, responsibility, and chores. This paper describes the motivation, intuition, and formal definition of a new role-based model for RBAC administration. This model is called ARBAC97 (administrative RBAC '97) and has three components: URA97 (user-role assignment '97), RPA97 (permission-role assignment '97), and RRA97 (role-role assignment '97) dealing with different aspects of RBAC administration. URA97, PRA97, and an  outline of RRA97 were defined in 1997, hence the designation given to the entire model. RRA97 was completed in 1998. ARBAC97 is described completely in this paper for the first time. We also discusses possible extensions of ARBAC97.", "authors": [{"name": "ravi sandhu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81312485832"}, {"name": "venkata bhamidipati", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100573458"}, {"name": "qamar munawer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100153709"}], "title": "The ARBAC97 model for role-based administration of roles", "citations": [{"Name": "Mikhail I.

WFMSs are used to coordinate and streamline business processes. Very large WFMSs are often used in organizations with users in the range of several thousands and process instances in the range of tens and thousands. To simplify the complexity of security administration, it is common practice in many businesses to allocate a role for each activity in the process and then assign one or more users to each role\u2014granting an authorization to roles rather than to users. Typically, security policies are expressed as constraints (or rules) on users and roles;separation of dutiesis a well-known constraint. Unfortunately, current role-based access control  models are not adequate to model such constraints. To address this issue we (1) present a language to express both static and dynamic authorization constraints as clauses in a logic program; (2) provide formal notions of constraint consistency; and (3) propose algorithms to check the consistency of constraints and assign users and roles to tasks that constitute the workflow in such a way that no constraints are violated.", "authors": [{"name": "elisa bertino", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409594658"}, {"name": "elena ferrari", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339498938"}, {"name": "vijay atluri", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100274477"}], "title": "The specification and enforcement of authorization constraints in workflow management systems", "citations": [{"Name": "James B.

An alternative role insertion algorithm is added, and it is shown how the role creation policies of Fernandez et al. correspond to role addition algorithms in our model. We then use our reference model to provide a taxonomy for kinds of conflict. We then go on to consider in some detail privilege-privilege and and role-role conflicts in conjunction with the role graph model. We show how role-role conflicts lead to a partitioning of the role graph into nonconflicting collections that can together be safely authorized to a given user. Finally, in  an appendix, we present the role graph algorithms with additional logic to disallow roles that contain conflicting privileges.", "authors": [{"name": "matunda nyanchama", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100374877"}, {"name": "sylvia osborn", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100002691"}], "title": "The role graph model and conflict of interest", "citations": [{"Name": "Sylvia L.

We present an approach on the basis of instance-based learning (IBL) techniques. To cast the anomaly-detection task in an IBL framework, we employ an approach that transforms temporal sequences of discrete, unordered observations into a metric space via a similarity measure that encodes intra-attribute dependencies. Classification boundaries are selected from ana posterioricharacterization of valid user behaviors, coupled with a domain heuristic. An empirical evaluation of the approach on user command data demonstrates that we can accurately differentiate the profiled user from  alternative users when the available features encode sufficient information. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the system detects anomalous conditionsquickly\u2014 an important quality for reducing potential damage by a malicious user. We present several techniques for reducing data storage requirements of the user profile, including instance-selection methods and clustering.

We present and analyze several simple password authentication protocols in this scenario, and show that the security of these protocols can be formally proven based on standard cryptographic assumptions. Remarkably, our analysis shows optimal resistance to off-line password guessing attacks under the choice of suitable public key encryption functions. In addition to user authentication, we describe ways to enhance these protocols to provide two-way authentication, authenticated key exchange, defense against server's compromise, and user  anonymity. We complement these results with a proof that strongly indicates that public key techniques are unavoidable for password protocols that resist off-line guessing attacks.As a further contribution, we introduce the notion ofpublic passwordsthat enables the use of the above protocols in situations where the client's machine does not have the means to validate the server's public key.

However, it will not work efficiently in an ATM network because it requires the termination of end-to-end ATM connections at a packet-filtering router, which incurs huge overhead of SAR (Segmentation and Reassembly). Very few approaches to this problem have been proposed in the literature, and none is completely satisfactory. In this paper we present the hardware design of a high-speed ATM firewall that does not require the termination of an end-to-end connection in the middle. We propose a novel firewall design philosophy, called Quality of Firewalling (QoF), that applies security measures of different strength to traffic with different risk levels and show how  it can be implemented in our firewall. Compared with the traditional firewalls, this ATM firewall performs exactly the same packet-level filtering without compromising the performance and has the same \"look and feel\" by sitting at the chokepoint between the trusted ATM LAN and untrusted ATM WAN. It is also easy to manage and flexible to use.", "authors": [{"name": "jun xu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451593740"}, {"name": "mukesh singhal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100065130"}], "title": "Design of a high-performance ATM firewall", "citations": [{"Name": "Alex X.

The proofs suggest minor changes to simplify the analysis.TLS, even at an abstract level, is much more complicated than most protocols verified by researchers.

Downloaded executable content consists of messages downloaded from remote hosts that contain executables that run, upon receipt, on the downloading principal's machine. Unless restricted, this content can perform malicious actions, including accessing its downloading principal's private data and sending messages on this principal's behalf. Current security architectures for controlling downloaded executable content (e.g., JDK 1.2) enable specification of access control requirements for content based on its provider and identity.  Since these access control requirements must cover every legal use of the class, they may include rights that are not necessary for a particular application of content.  Therefore, using these systems, an application composed from downloaded executable content cannot enforce its access control requirements without the addition of application-specific security mechanisms.  In this paper, we define an access control model with the following properties: (1) system administrators can define system access control requirements on applications and (2) application developers can use the same model to enforce application access control requirements without the need for ad hoc security mechanisms.  This access control model uses features of role-based access control models to enable (1) specification of a single role that applies to multiple application instances; (2) selection of a content's access rights based on the content's application and role in the  application; (3) consistency maintained between application state and content access rights; and (4) control of role administration. We detail a system architecture that uses this access control model to implement secure collaborative applications. Lastly, we describe an implementation of this architecture, called the Lava security architecture.", "authors": [{"name": "trent jaeger", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100654847"}, {"name": "atul prakash", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100516701"}, {"name": "jochen liedtke", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100561299"}, {"name": "nayeem islam", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332506182"}], "title": "Flexible control of downloaded executable content", "citations": [{"Name": "Elisa Bertino ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Piero Andrea Bonatti ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Elena Ferrari", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jingwei Huang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "David M.

Recent work has extended this technique to include multiple paths in an effort to bolster authentication, but the success of this approach may be unclear in the face of intersecting paths, ambiguities in the meaning of certificates, and interdependencies in the use of different keys. Thus, several authors have proposed metrics to evaluate the confidence afforded by a set of paths. In this paper we develop a set of guiding principles for the design of such metrics. We motivate our principles by showing how previous approaches failed with respect to these principles and what the consequences to authentication might be.

For instance, a person's current location is a sensitive piece of information that only authorized entities should be able to learn. Several challenges arise in the specification and implementation of policies controlling access to location information. For example, there can be multiple sources of location information. The sources can be within different administrative domains, which might allow different entities to specify policies, and policies need to be flexible. We address these issues in our design of a distributed access control mechanism for a people location system. Our design encodes policies as digital certificates, which enables decentralized storage of policies. We also present an algorithm for the discovery of distributed certificates. Furthermore, we discuss several privacy issues and show how our design addresses them. To show feasibility of our design, we built an example implementation based on SPKI/SDSI certificates. Using measurements, we quantify the influence of access control on query processing time. We also discuss trade-offs between RSA-based and DSA-based signature schemes for digital certificates.", "authors": [{"name": "urs hengartner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100043795"}, {"name": "peter steenkiste", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100046273"}], "title": "Access control to people location information", "citations": [{"Name": "Maria Luisa Damiani ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Elisa Bertino ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Claudio Silvestri", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Heechang Shin ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Vijayalakshmi Atluri", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Spatiotemporal Access Control Enforcement under Uncertain Location Estimates", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Proceedings of the 23rd Annual IFIP WG 11.3 Working Conference on Data and Applications Security XXIII", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "July 12-15", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "2009", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Montreal", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "P.Q.", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ben Greenstein ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ramakrishna Gummadi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jeffrey Pang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mike Y.

Access control policies in an enterprise environment typically express these requirements as authorization constraints. While desirable for access control, constraints can lead to conflicts in the overall policy in a multidomain environment. The administration problem for enterprise-wide access control, therefore, not only includes authorization management for users and resources within a single domain but also conflict resolution among heterogeneous access control policies of multiple domains to allow secure interoperation within the enterprise. This work presents design and implementation of X-GTRBAC Admin, an administration model that aims at enabling administration of role-based access control (RBAC) policies in the presence of constraints with support for conflict resolution in a multidomain environment. A key feature of the model is that it allows decentralization of policy administration tasks through the abstraction of administrative domains, which not only simplifies authorization management, but is also fundamental to the concept of decentralized conflict resolution presented. The paper also illustrates the applicability of the outlined administrative concepts in a realistic enterprise environment using an implementation prototype that facilitates policy administration in large enterprises.", "authors": [{"name": "rafae bhatti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100545165"}, {"name": "basit shafiq", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100322125"}, {"name": "elisa bertino", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409594658"}, {"name": "arif ghafoor", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100493628"}, {"name": "james b d joshi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100641772"}], "title": "X-gtrbac admin: A decentralized administration model for enterprise-wide access control", "citations": [{"Name": "James B.

A usage control decision is determined by combining authorizations, obligations, and conditions, presented asUCONABCcore models by Park and Sandhu. Based on these core aspects, we develop a formal model and logical specification of UCON with an extension of Lamport's temporal logic of actions (TLA). The building blocks of this model include: (1) a set of sequences of system states based on the attributes of subjects, objects, and the system, (2) authorization predicates based on subject and object attributes, (3) usage control actions to update attributes and accessing status of a usage process, (4) obligation actions, and (5) condition predicates based on system attributes. A usage control policy is defined as a set of temporal logic formulas that are satisfied as the system state changes. A fixed set of scheme rules is defined to specify general UCON policies with the properties of soundness and completeness. We show the flexibility and expressive capability of this formal model by specifying the core models of UCON and some applications.", "authors": [{"name": "xinwen zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351603781"}, {"name": "francesco parisi-presicce", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100397569"}, {"name": "ravi sandhu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81312485832"}, {"name": "jaehong park", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452601300"}], "title": "Formal model and policy specification of usage control", "citations": [{"Name": "Michael J.

In this paper, we present a general incentive-based method to model AIOS and a game-theoretic approach to inferring AIOS. On one hand, we found that the concept of incentives can unify a large variety of attacker intents; the concept of utilities can integrate incentives and costs in such a way that attacker objectives can be practically modeled. On the other hand, we developed a game-theoretic AIOS formalization which can capture the inherent interdependency between AIOS and defender objectives and strategies in such a way that AIOS can be automatically inferred.

However, due to the resource constraints on sensor nodes, it is not feasible to use traditional key management techniques such as public key cryptography and key distribution center (KDC). A number of key predistribution techniques have been proposed for pairwise key establishment in sensor networks recently. To facilitate the study of novel pairwise key predistribution techniques, this paper develops a general framework for establishing pairwise keys between sensor nodes using bivariate polynomials. This paper then proposes two efficient instantiations of the general framework: arandom subset assignmentkey predistribution scheme, and ahypercube-basedkey predistribution scheme. The analysis shows that both schemes have a number of nice properties, including high probability, or guarantee to establish pairwise keys, tolerance of node captures, and low storage, communication, and computation overhead. To further reduce the computation at sensor nodes, this paper presents an optimization technique for polynomial evaluation, which is used to compute pairwise keys. This paper also reports the implementation and the performance of the proposed schemes on MICA2 motes running TinyOS, an operating system for networked sensors. The results indicate that the proposed techniques can be applied efficiently in resource-constrained sensor networks.", "authors": [{"name": "donggang liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452595951"}, {"name": "peng ning", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332518403"}, {"name": "rongfang li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81392598390"}], "title": "Establishing pairwise keys in distributed sensor networks", "citations": [{"Name": "Ruiyi Zhang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Johnson P.

Most defenses employ a \u201cguard the doors\u201d approach, blocking known mechanisms of code injection.Randomized instruction set emulation(RISE) is a complementary method of defense, one that performs a hidden randomization of an application's machine code. If foreign binary code is injected into a program running under RISE, it will not be executable because it will not know the proper randomization. The paper describes and analyzes RISE, describing a proof-of-concept implementation built on the open-source Valgrind IA32-to-IA32 translator. The prototype effectively disrupts binary code injection attacks, without requiring recompilation, linking, or access to application source code. Under RISE, injected code (attacks) essentially executes random code sequences. Empirical studies and a theoretical model are reported which treat the effects of executing random code on two different architectures (IA32 and PowerPC). The paper discusses possible extensions and applications of the RISE technique in other contexts.", "authors": [{"name": "elena gabriela barrantes", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81414597009"}, {"name": "david h ackley", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81414591773"}, {"name": "stephanie forrest", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100610083"}, {"name": "darko stefanovic", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100613136"}], "title": "Randomized instruction set emulation", "citations": [{"Name": "Anil Somayaji ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michael Locasto ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jan Feyereisl", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michele Co ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jack W.

It then becomes of primary importance to provide means of protecting the secrecy of the information, while guaranteeing its availability to legitimate clients. Operating online querying services securely on open networks is very difficult; therefore many enterprises outsource their data center operations to external application service providers. A promising direction toward prevention of unauthorized access to outsourced data is represented by encryption. However, data encryption is often supported for the sole purpose of protecting the data in storage while allowing access to plaintext values by the server, which decrypts data for query execution. In this paper, we present a simple yet robust single-server solution for remote querying of encrypted databases on external servers. Our approach is based on the use of indexing information attached to the encrypted database, which can be used by the server to select the data to be returned in response to a query without the need of accessing the plaintext database content. Our indexes balance the trade-off between efficiency requirements in query execution and protection requirements due to possible inference attacks exploiting indexing information. We investigate quantitative measures to model inference exposure and provide some related experimental results.", "authors": [{"name": "alberto ceselli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100000882"}, {"name": "ernesto damiani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100103470"}, {"name": "sabrina de capitani di vimercati", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100142780"}, {"name": "sushil jajodia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100609407"}, {"name": "stefano paraboschi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100004747"}, {"name": "pierangela samarati", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100191823"}], "title": "Modeling and assessing inference exposure in encrypted databases", "citations": [{"Name": "Aaron Steele ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Keith B.

These environments are characterized by heterogeneous, distributed computing systems exchanging enormous volumes of time-critical data with varying levels of access control in a dynamic business environment. The enterprises are thus faced with significant challenges as they endeavor to achieve their primary goals, and simultaneously ensure enterprise-wide secure interoperation among the various collaborating entities. Key among these challenges are providing effective mechanism for enforcement of enterprise policy across distributed domains, ensuring secure content-based access to enterprise resources at all user levels, and allowing the specification of temporal and nontemporal context conditions to support fine-grained dynamic access control. In this paper, we investigate these challenges, and present X-GTRBAC, an XML-based GTRBAC policy specification language and its implementation for enforcing enterprise-wide access control. Our specification language is based on the GTRBAC model that incorporates the content- and context-aware dynamic access control requirements of an enterprise. An X-GTRBAC system has been implemented as a Java application. We discuss the salient features of the specification language, and present the software architecture of our system. A comprehensive example is included to discuss and motivate the applicability of the X-GTRBAC framework to a generic enterprise environment. An application level interface for implementing the policy in the X-GTRBAC system is also provided to consolidate the ideas presented in the paper.", "authors": [{"name": "rafae bhatti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100545165"}, {"name": "arif ghafoor", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100493628"}, {"name": "elisa bertino", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409594658"}, {"name": "james b d joshi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100641772"}], "title": "X-GTRBAC: an XML-based policy specification framework and architecture for enterprise-wide access control", "citations": [{"Name": "Youna Jung ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "James B.

Before doing so, keys for performing encryption and authentication must be agreed upon by the communicating parties. Due to resource constraints, however, achieving key agreement in wireless sensor networks is nontrivial. Many key agreement schemes used in general networks, such as Diffie-Hellman and other public-key based schemes, are not suitable for wireless sensor networks due to the limited computational abilities of the sensor nodes. Predistribution of secret keys for all pairs of nodes is not viable due to the large amount of memory this requires when the network size is large.In this paper, we provide a framework in which to study the security of key predistribution schemes, propose a new key predistribution scheme which substantially improves the resilience of the network compared to previous schemes, and give an in-depth analysis of our scheme in terms of network resilience and associated overhead. Our scheme exhibits a nice threshold property: when the number of compromised nodes is less than the threshold, the probability that communications between any additional nodes are compromised is close to zero. This desirable property lowers the initial payoff of smaller-scale network breaches to an adversary, and makes it necessary for the adversary to attack a large fraction of the network before it can achieve any significant gain.", "authors": [{"name": "wenliang du", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451597756"}, {"name": "jing deng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81318488254"}, {"name": "yunghsiang s han", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100051450"}, {"name": "pramod k varshney", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100561905"}, {"name": "jonathan katz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100411790"}, {"name": "aram khalili", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100502038"}], "title": "A pairwise key predistribution scheme for wireless sensor networks", "citations": [{"Name": "Tran Thanh Dai ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Choong Seon Hong", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "An ID-Based Random Key Pre-distribution Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Proceedings of the 7th international conference on Computational Science", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "R.

The decision of whether an information flow is permitted or denied depends on both the authorizations specified on the objects and the process by which information is obtained and transmitted. Depending on the specific computations, a process accessing sensitive information could still be allowed to release information to users who are not allowed to directly access it. Exceptions to the permissions and restrictions stated by the authorizations are specified by means of exceptions associated with methods. Two kinds of exceptions are considered:invoke exceptions,applicable during a mehtod execution andreply exceptionsapplicable to the information returned by a method.   Information flowing from one object into another or returned to the user is subject to the different exceptions specified for the methods enforcing the transmission. We formally characterize information transmission and flow in a transaction and define the conditions for safe information flow. We define security specifications and characterize safe information flows. We propose an approach to control unsafe flows and present an algorithm to enforce it.

In this paper, we adapt and refine several of the best ideas from previous models and add new ones to build the new Multilevel Relational (MLR) data model. MLR provides multilevel relations with element-level labeling as a natural extension of the traditional relational data model. MLR introduces several new concepts (notably, data-borrow integrity and the UPLEVEL statement) and significantly redefines existing concepts (polyinstantiation and referential integrity as well as data manipulation operations). A central contribution of this paper is proofs of soundness, completeness, and security of MLR. A newdata-basedsemantics is given for the MLR data model by combining  ideas from SeaView, belief-based semantics, and LDV. This new semantics has the advantages of both eliminating ambiguity and retaining upward information flow. MLR is secure, unambiguous, and powerful. It has five integrity properties and five operations for manipulating multilevel relations. Soundness, completeness, and security show that any of the five database manipulation operations will keep database states legal (i.e., satisfy all integrity properties), that every legal database state can be constructed, and that MLR is noninterfering. The expressive power of MLR also compares favorably with several other models.", "authors": [{"name": "ravi sandhu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81312485832"}, {"name": "fang chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100107497"}], "title": "The multilevel relational (MLR) data model", "citations": [{"Name": "Pramote Luenam ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Peng Liu", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Pooja Sapra ", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Suresh Kumar ", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "R.
