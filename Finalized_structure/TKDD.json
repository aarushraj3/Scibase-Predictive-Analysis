Not only is the inference a difficult problem involving statistical reasonings but the bulky size, together with the ever-increasing nature, of the log data imposes extra requirements on scalability. In this paper, we propose the Bayesian Browsing Model (BBM), which performs exact inference of the document relevance, only requires a single pass of the data (i.e., the optimal scalability), and is shown effective.We present two sets of experiments to evaluate the model effectiveness and scalability. On the first set of over 50 million search instances of 1.1 million distinct queries, BBM outperforms the state-of-the-art competitor by 29.2&percnt; in log-likelihood while being57 timesfaster. On the second click log set, spanning a quarter of petabyte, we showcase the scalability of BBM: we implemented it on a commercial MapReduce cluster, and it took only 3 hours to compute the relevance for 1.15 billion distinct query-URL pairs.", "authors": [{"name": "chao liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81365596508"}, {"name": "fan guo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81333489042"}, {"name": "christos faloutsos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100373169"}], "title": "Bayesian Browsing Model: Exact Inference of Document Relevance from Petabyte-Scale Data", "citations": [{"Name": "Dawei Yin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bin Cao ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jian-Tao Sun ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Brian D.

We generalize their information and privacy requirements to the problems ofcentralized anonymizationanddistributed anonymization, and identify the major challenges that make traditional data anonymization methods not applicable. Furthermore, we propose a new privacy model calledLKC-privacyto overcome the challenges and present two anonymization algorithms to achieve LKC-privacy in both the centralized and the distributed scenarios. Experiments on real-life data demonstrate that our anonymization algorithms can effectively retain the essential information in anonymous data for data analysis and is scalable for anonymizing large datasets.", "authors": [{"name": "noman mohammed", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350598980"}, {"name": "benjamin c m fung", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81327488637"}, {"name": "patrick c k hung", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100111447"}, {"name": "cheuk-kwong lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436596642"}], "title": "Centralized and Distributed Anonymization for High-Dimensional Healthcare Data", "citations": [{"Name": "Dima Alhadidi ", "Country": "oman", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Noman Mohammed ", "Country": "oman", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Benjamin C.

The state-of-the-art of BT derives a linear Poisson regression model from fine-grained user behavioral data and predicts click-through rate (CTR) from user history. We designed and implemented a highly scalable and efficient solution to BT using Hadoop MapReduce framework. With our parallel algorithm and the resulting system, we can build above 450 BT-category models from the entire Yahoo\u2019s user base within one day, the scale that one can not even imagine with prior systems. Moreover, our approach has yielded 20&percnt; CTR lift over the existing production system by leveraging the well-grounded probabilistic model fitted from a much larger training dataset.Specifically, our major contributions include: (1) A MapReduce statistical learning algorithm and implementation that achieve optimal data parallelism, task parallelism, and load balance in spite of the typically skewed distribution of domain data. (2) An in-place feature vector generation algorithm with strict linear-time complexityO(n) regardless of the granularity of sliding target window. (3) An in-memory caching scheme that significantly reduces the number of disk IOs to make large-scale learning practical. (4) Highly efficient data structures and sparse representations of models and data to enable fast model updates. We believe that our work makes significant contributions to solving large-scale machine learning problems of industrial relevance in general.

We use the principle of conservation to identify activity that consistently precedes an outcome in patients, and describe a two-stage process that allows us to efficiently search for such patterns in large datasets. This involves first transforming continuous physiological signals from patients into symbolic sequences, and then searching for patterns in these reduced representations that are strongly associated with an outcome.Our strategy of identifying conserved activity that is unlikely to have occurred purely by chance in symbolic data is analogous to the discovery of regulatory motifs in genomic datasets. We build upon existing work in this area, generalizing the notion of a regulatory motif and enhancing current techniques to operate robustly on non-genomic data. We also address two significant considerations associated with motif discovery in general: computational efficiency and robustness in the presence of degeneracy and noise. To deal with these issues, we introduce the concept of active regions and new subset-based techniques such as a two-layer Gibbs sampling algorithm. These extensions allow for a framework for information inference, where precursors are identified as approximately conserved activity of arbitrary complexity preceding multiple occurrences of an event.We evaluated our solution on a population of patients who experienced sudden cardiac death and attempted to discover electrocardiographic activity that may be associated with the endpoint of death. To assess the predictive patterns discovered, we compared likelihood scores for motifs in the sudden death population against control populations of normal individuals and those with non-fatal supraventricular arrhythmias. Our results suggest that predictive motif discovery may be able to identify clinically relevant information even in the absence of significant prior knowledge.", "authors": [{"name": "zeeshan syed", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81317500455"}, {"name": "collin stultz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81337493539"}, {"name": "manolis kellis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453653885"}, {"name": "piotr indyk", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100484622"}, {"name": "john guttag", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100171020"}], "title": "Motif discovery in physiological datasets: A methodology for inferring predictive elements", "citations": [{"Name": "Risa B.

These systems often rely on collaborating filtering (CF), where past transactions are analyzed in order to establish connections between users and products. The most common approach to CF is based on neighborhood models, which originate from similarities between products or users. In this work we introduce a new neighborhood model with an improved prediction accuracy. Unlike previous approaches that are based on heuristic similarities, we model neighborhood relations by minimizing a global cost function. Further accuracy improvements are achieved by extending the model to exploit both explicit and implicit feedback by the users. Past models were limited by the need to compute all pairwise similarities between items or users, which grow quadratically with input size. In particular, this limitation vastly complicates adopting user similarity models, due to the typical large number of users. Our new model solves these limitations by factoring the neighborhood model, thus making both item-item and user-user implementations scale linearly with the size of the data. The methods are tested on the Netflix data, with encouraging results.", "authors": [{"name": "yehuda koren", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100202295"}], "title": "Factor in the neighbors: Scalable and accurate collaborative filtering", "citations": [{"Name": "Marcelo G.

Many tools have been proposed to query the data and navigate through the levels of granularity. However, automatic tools are still missing to mine this type of data in order to discover regular specific patterns. In this article, we present a method for mining sequential patterns from multidimensional databases, at the same time taking advantage of the different dimensions and levels of granularity, which is original compared to existing work. The necessary definitions and algorithms are extended from regular sequential patterns to this particular case.

VOGUE relies on a variable gap sequence mining method to extract frequent patterns with different lengths and gaps between elements. It then uses these mined sequences to build a variable order hidden Markov model (HMM), that explicitly models the gaps. The gaps implicitly model the order of the HMM, and they explicitly model the duration of each state. We apply VOGUE to a variety of real sequence data taken from domains such as protein sequence classification, Web usage logs, intrusion detection, and spelling correction. We show that VOGUE has superior classification accuracy compared to regular HMMs, higher-order HMMs, and even special purpose HMMs like HMMER, which is a state-of-the-art method for protein classification.

When clustering such data, there may exist multiple groupings that are reasonable and interesting from different perspectives. This is especially true for high-dimensional data, where different feature subspaces may reveal different structures of the data. However, traditional clustering is restricted to finding only one single clustering of the data. In this article, we propose a new clustering paradigm for exploratory data analysis: find all non-redundant clustering solutions of the data, where data points in the same cluster in one solution can belong to different clusters in other partitioning solutions. We present a framework to solve this problem and suggest two approaches within this framework: (1) orthogonal clustering, and (2) clustering in orthogonal subspaces. In essence, both approaches find alternative ways to partition the data by projecting it to a space that is orthogonal to the current solution. The first approach seeks orthogonality in the cluster space, while the second approach seeks orthogonality in the feature space. We study the relationship between the two approaches. We also combine our framework with techniques for automatically finding the number of clusters in the different solutions, and study stopping criteria for determining when all meaningful solutions are discovered. We test our framework on both synthetic and high-dimensional benchmark data sets, and the results show that indeed our approaches were able to discover varied clustering solutions that are interesting and meaningful.", "authors": [{"name": "ying cui", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351594984"}, {"name": "xiaoli z fern", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100360432"}, {"name": "jennifer g dy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100485643"}], "title": "Learning multiple nonredundant clusterings", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "40\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "540\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "yahooexcl labs sunnyvale ca", "city": null, "Name": "ying cui"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "oregon state university corvallis or", "city": null, "Name": "xiaoli z fern"}, {"country": "china", "university": "northeastern university", "affiliation_string": "northeastern university boston ma", "city": "shenyang", "Name": "jennifer g dy"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Christian Borgelt , Michael R.

In previous approaches this is mainly decided by the total number of FIs, which results in poor performance when a large number of FIs are involved. To solve this problem, a three-strategy adaptive algorithm, bitmap itemset support counting (BISC), is presented. The core strategy, BISC1, is used in the innermost steps of the recursion. For a databaseDwith onlysfrequent items, a depth-first approach need up toslevels of recursions to detect all the FIs (up to 2s). BISC1 completely replaces these recursions with a special summation that directly calculates the supports of all the possible 2scandidate itemsets. With BISC1 the run-time is entirely independent of the database after one database scan, and the per-candidate cost is onlys. To offset the exponential growth of cost (both time and space) with BISC1 assincreases, a second strategy, BISC2, is introduced to effectively double the acceptable range ofs. BISC2 divides an itemset into prefix and suffix and improves the performance by pruning all the itemsets with infrequent prefixes. If the total number of frequent items inDis high, the classic database projection strategy is used. In this case for the firstsitems a single run of BISC (1 or 2) is applied. For each of the remaining items, a projected database is created and the mining process proceeds recursively. To achieve optimal performance, BISC adaptively decides which strategy to use based on the dataset and minimum support. Experiments show that BISC outperforms previous approaches in all the datasets tested. Even though this does not guarantee that BISC will always perform the best, the result is impressive given the fact that most existing algorithms are only efficient in some types of datasets. The memory usage of BISC is also comparable to those of other algorithms.", "authors": [{"name": "jinlin chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81321489820"}, {"name": "keli xiao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81361599393"}], "title": "BISC: A bitmap itemset support counting approach for efficient frequent itemset mining", "citations": [{"Name": "Jaewoo Lee ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Christopher W.

Namely, given a large graphG&equals;(V,E) we want to estimate as accurately as possible the number of triangles incident to every nodev\u2208Vin the graph. We consider the question both for undirected and directed graphs. The problem of computing theglobalnumber of triangles in a graph has been considered before, but to our knowledge this is the first contribution that addresses the problem of approximatelocaltriangle counting with a focus on the efficiency issues arising in massive graphs and that also considers the directed case. The distribution of the local number of triangles and the related local clustering coefficient can be used in many interesting applications. For example, we show that the measures we compute can help detect the presence of spamming activity in large-scale Web graphs, as well as to provide useful features for content quality assessment in social networks.For computing the local number of triangles (undirected and directed), we propose two approximation algorithms, which are based on the idea of min-wise independent permutations [Broder et al. 1998]. Our algorithms operate in a semi-streaming fashion, usingO(&vert;V&vert;) space in main memory and performingO(log &vert;V&vert;) sequential scans over the edges of the graph. The first algorithm we describe in this article also usesO(&vert;E&vert;) space of external memory during computation, while the second algorithm uses only main memory. We present the theoretical analysis as well as experimental results on large graphs, demonstrating the practical efficiency of our approach.", "authors": [{"name": "luca becchetti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100259139"}, {"name": "paolo boldi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100628240"}, {"name": "carlos castillo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100469839"}, {"name": "aristides gionis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100631289"}], "title": "Efficient algorithms for large-scale local triangle counting", "citations": [{"Name": "Qiong Zou ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bu\u011fra Gedik ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kun Wang", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Peixiang Zhao", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yongsub Lim ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "U Kang", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Stephen J.

This two-step procedure usually results in simpler, more interpretable and actionable models without any loss in accuracy. In this work, we consider problems such as predicting customer behavior across products, where the independent variables can be naturally partitioned into two sets, that is, the data is dyadic in nature. A pivoting operation now results in the dependent variable showing up as entries in a \u201ccustomer by product\u201d data matrix. We present the Simultaneous CO-clustering And Learning (SCOAL) framework, based on the key idea of interleaving co-clustering and construction of prediction models to iteratively improve both cluster assignment and fit of the models. This algorithm provably converges to a local minimum of a suitable cost function. The framework not only generalizes co-clustering and collaborative filtering to model-based co-clustering, but can also be viewed as simultaneous co-segmentation and classification or regression, which is typically better than independently clustering the data first and then building models. Moreover, it applies to a wide range of bi-modal or multimodal data, and can be easily specialized to address classification and regression problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both these problems through experimentation on a variety of datasets.", "authors": [{"name": "meghana deodhar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331491624"}, {"name": "joydeep ghosh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100558602"}], "title": "SCOAL: A framework for simultaneous co-clustering and learning from complex data", "citations": [{"Name": "Ruggero G.

One natural way to deal with such problems is to construct a binary classifier for each label, resulting in a set of independent binary classification problems. Since multiple labels share the same input space, and the semantics conveyed by different labels are usually correlated, it is essential to exploit the correlation information contained in different labels. In this paper, we consider a general framework for extracting shared structures in multi-label classification. In this framework, a common subspace is assumed to be shared among multiple labels. We show that the optimal solution to the proposed formulation can be obtained by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem, though the problem is nonconvex. For high-dimensional problems, direct computation of the solution is expensive, and we develop an efficient algorithm for this case. One appealing feature of the proposed framework is that it includes several well-known algorithms as special cases, thus elucidating their intrinsic relationships. We further show that the proposed framework can be extended to the kernel-induced feature space. We have conducted extensive experiments on multi-topic web page categorization and automatic gene expression pattern image annotation tasks, and results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formulation in comparison with several representative algorithms.", "authors": [{"name": "shuiwang ji", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81333489125"}, {"name": "lei tang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81363600542"}, {"name": "shipeng yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100473562"}, {"name": "jieping ye", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100042425"}], "title": "A shared-subspace learning framework for multi-label classification", "citations": [{"Name": "Lei Zhang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yao Zhao ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zhenfeng Zhu", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Extracting shared subspace incrementally for multi-label image classification", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Huawen Liu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shichao Zhang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xindong Wu", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "MLSLR: Multilabel Learning via Sparse Logistic Regression", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yuhong Guo ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dale Schuurmans", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Caijuan Shi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Qiuqi Ruan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gaoyun An", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Eva Gibaja ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sebasti\u00e1n Ventura", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Multi-label learning: a review of the state of the art and ongoing research", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "200\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "12\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "1140\n", "Citation Count": "25\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Grenada", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "arizona state university tempe az", "city": "tempe", "Name": "shuiwang ji"}, {"country": "Grenada", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "arizona state university tempe az", "city": "tempe", "Name": "lei tang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "jieping ye", "city": null, "Name": "shipeng yu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "lei tang", "city": null, "Name": "arizona state university tempe az"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Naoki Abe , Bianca Zadrozny , John Langford, An iterative method for multi-class cost-sensitive learning, Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining, August 22-25, 2004, Seattle, WA, USA[doi>10.1145/1014052.1014056]\n", "Erin L.

The algorithm is based on the hypothesis that nonlinear decision nodes provide a better basis than axis-parallel decision nodes and utilizes discriminant analysis to construct nonlinear decision trees that take account of costs of misclassification.The performance of the algorithm is evaluated by applying it to seventeen datasets and the results are compared with those obtained by two well known cost-sensitive algorithms, ICET and MetaCost, which generate multiple trees to obtain some of the best results to date. The results show that CSNL performs at least as well, if not better than these algorithms, in more than twelve of the datasets and is considerably faster. The use of bagging with CSNL further enhances its performance showing the significant benefits of using nonlinear decision nodes.", "authors": [{"name": "sunil vadera", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100442964"}], "title": "CSNL: A cost-sensitive non-linear decision tree algorithm", "citations": [{"Name": "Asdr\u00faBal L\u00f3Pez-Chau ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jair Cervantes ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lourdes L\u00f3Pez-Garc\u00edA ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Farid Garc\u00edA Lamont", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fisher's decision tree", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alejandro Correa Bahnsen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Djamila Aouada ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bj\u00f6rn Ottersten", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Example-dependent cost-sensitive decision trees", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "40\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "632\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of salford", "affiliation_string": "university of salford salford united kingdom", "city": "salford", "Name": "sunil vadera"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Allison, P. and Waterman, R. 2002.

To understand underlying mechanisms of complex phenotypes, it is often necessary to consider joint genetic effects across multiple SNPs. ANOVA (analysis of variance) test is routinely used in association study. Important findings from studying gene-gene (SNP-pair) interactions are appearing in the literature. However, the number of SNPs can be up to millions. Evaluating joint effects of SNPs is a challenging task even for SNP-pairs. Moreover, with large number of SNPs correlated, permutation procedure is preferred over simple Bonferroni correction for properly controlling family-wise error rate and retaining mapping power, which dramatically increases the computational cost of association study.In this article, we study the problem of finding SNP-pairs that have significant associations with a given quantitative phenotype. We propose an efficient algorithm, FastANOVA, for performing ANOVA tests on SNP-pairs in a batch mode, which also supports large permutation test. We derive an upper bound of SNP-pair ANOVA test, which can be expressed as the sum of two terms. The first term is based on single-SNP ANOVA test. The second term is based on the SNPs and independent of any phenotype permutation. Furthermore, SNP-pairs can be organized into groups, each of which shares a common upper bound. This allows for maximum reuse of intermediate computation, efficient upper bound estimation, and effective SNP-pair pruning. Consequently, FastANOVA only needs to perform the ANOVA test on a small number of candidate SNP-pairs without the risk of missing any significant ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FastANOVA is orders of magnitude faster than the brute-force implementation of ANOVA tests on all SNP pairs. The principles used in FastANOVA can be applied to categorical phenotypes and other statistics such as Chi-square test.", "authors": [{"name": "xiang zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367594736"}, {"name": "fei zou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350568114"}, {"name": "wei wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452601906"}], "title": "Efficient algorithms for genome-wide association study", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "25\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "415\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Hong Kong", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of north carolina at chapel hill chapel hill nc", "city": "north", "Name": "xiang zhang"}, {"country": "Hong Kong", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of north carolina at chapel hill chapel hill nc", "city": "north", "Name": "fei zou"}, {"country": "Hong Kong", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of north carolina at chapel hill chapel hill nc", "city": "north", "Name": "wei wang"}]}, "Article No.: 15": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/1631162.1631163", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "heikki mannila", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100086722"}, {"name": "dimitrios gunopulos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100515024"}], "title": "ACM TKDD special issue ACM SIGKDD 2007 and ACM SIGKDD 2008", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "25\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "284\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "finland", "university": "university of helsinki", "affiliation_string": "helsinki university of technology and university of helsinki", "city": "helsinki", "Name": "heikki mannila"}, {"country": "greece", "university": "university of athens", "affiliation_string": "national and kapodistrian university of athens and university of california riverside", "city": "athens", "Name": "dimitrios gunopulos"}]}, "Article No.: 20": {"references": ["Mustafa Bilgic , Lise Getoor, VOILA: efficient feature-value acquisition for classification, Proceedings of the 22nd national conference on Artificial intelligence, p.1225-1230, July 22-26, 2007, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada\n", "Mustafa Bilgic , Lise Getoor, Effective label acquisition for collective classification, Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining, August 24-27, 2008, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA[doi>10.1145/1401890.1401901]\n", "Avrim Blum , Shuchi Chawla, Learning from Labeled and Unlabeled Data using Graph Mincuts, Proceedings of the Eighteenth International Conference on Machine Learning, p.19-26, June 28-July 01, 2001\n", "Soumen Chakrabarti , Byron Dom , Piotr Indyk, Enhanced hypertext categorization using hyperlinks, Proceedings of the 1998 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data, p.307-318, June 01-04, 1998, Seattle, Washington, USA[doi>10.1145/276304.276332]\n", "Chapelle, O., Sch\u00f6lkopf, B., and Zien, A., Eds. 2006.

However, sometimes the advantage of exploiting the relationships can become a disadvantage. Simple models like label propagation and iterative classification can aggravate a misclassification by propagating mistakes in the network, while more complex models that define and optimize a global objective function, such as Markov random fields and graph mincuts, can misclassify a set of nodes jointly. This problem can be mitigated if the classification system is allowed to ask for the correct labels for a few of the nodes during inference. However, determining the optimal set of labels to acquire is intractable under relatively general assumptions, which forces us to resort to approximate and heuristic techniques. We describe three such techniques in this article. The first one is based on directly approximating the value of the objective function of label acquisition and greedily acquiring the label that provides the most improvement. The second technique is a simple technique based on the analogy we draw between viral marketing and label acquisition. Finally, we propose a method, which we refer to asreflect and correct, that can learn and predict when the classification system is likely to make mistakes and suggests acquisitions to correct those mistakes. We empirically show on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets that the reflect and correct method significantly outperforms the other two techniques, as well as other approaches based on network structural measures such as node degree and network clustering.", "authors": [{"name": "mustafa bilgic", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81361591906"}, {"name": "lise getoor", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100205081"}], "title": "Reflect and correct: A misclassification prediction approach to active inference", "citations": [{"Name": "V\u00e9ronique Van Vlasselaer ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tina Eliassi-Rad ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Leman Akoglu ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Monique Snoeck ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bart Baesens", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "32\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "376\n", "Citation Count": "6\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland at college park college park md", "city": null, "Name": "mustafa bilgic"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland at college park college park md", "city": null, "Name": "lise getoor"}]}, "Article No.: 18": {"references": ["Daniel J.

This article has two goals; The first goal is exact and efficient identification of the model whose state sequence has the highest likelihood for the given query sequence (more precisely, no HMM that actually has a high-probability path for the given sequence is missed by the algorithm), and the second goal is exact and efficient monitoring of streaming data sequences to find the best model. We propose SPIRAL, a fast search method for HMM datasets. SPIRAL is based on three ideas; (1) it clusters states of models to compute approximate likelihood, (2) it uses several granularities and approximates likelihood values in search processing, and (3) it focuses on just the promising likelihood computations by pruning out low-likelihood state sequences. Experiments verify the effectiveness of SPIRAL and show that it is more than 490 times faster than the naive method.", "authors": [{"name": "yasuhiro fujiwara", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367593789"}, {"name": "yasushi sakurai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452606482"}, {"name": "masaru kitsuregawa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100417887"}], "title": "Fast likelihood search for hidden Markov models", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "37\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "664\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ntt cyber space labs yokosuka-shi kanagawa japan and university of tokyo meguro-ku tokyo japan", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "yasuhiro fujiwara"}, {"country": "Japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ntt communication science labs soraku kyoto japan", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "yasushi sakurai"}, {"country": "Japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of tokyo meguro-ku tokyo japan", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "masaru kitsuregawa"}]}, "Article No.: 16": {"references": ["Floortje Alkemade , Carolina Castaldi, Strategies for the Diffusion of Innovations on Social Networks, Computational Economics, v.25 n.1-2, p.3-23, February  2005[doi>10.1007/s10614-005-6245-1]\n", "Asur, S., Parthasarathy, S., and Ucar, D. 2007.

There have been many studies in the literature targeted at studying and mining these graphs. However, almost all of them have studied these graphs from a static point of view. The study of the evolution of these graphs over time can provide tremendous insight on the behavior of entities, communities and the flow of information among them. In this work, we present an event-based characterization of critical behavioral patterns for temporally varying interaction graphs. We use nonoverlapping snapshots of interaction graphs and develop a framework for capturing and identifying interesting events from them. We use these events to characterize complex behavioral patterns of individuals and communities over time. We show how semantic information can be incorporated to reason about community-behavior events. We also demonstrate the application of behavioral patterns for the purposes of modeling evolution, link prediction and influence maximization. Finally, we present a diffusion model for evolving networks, based on our framework.", "authors": [{"name": "sitaram asur", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309490515"}, {"name": "srinivasan parthasarathy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100375834"}, {"name": "duygu ucar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309501559"}], "title": "An event-based framework for characterizing the evolutionary behavior of interaction graphs", "citations": [{"Name": "Alfredo Cuzzocrea ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Francesco Folino ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Clara Pizzuti", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tobias Hecking ", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sabrina Ziebarth ", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "H.

In evolutionary clustering, a good clustering result should fit the current data well, while simultaneously not deviate too dramatically from the recent history. To fulfill this dual purpose, a measure oftemporal smoothnessis integrated in the overall measure of clustering quality. In this article, we propose two frameworks that incorporate temporal smoothness in evolutionary spectral clustering. For both frameworks, we start with intuitions gained from the well-knownk-means clustering problem, and then propose and solve corresponding cost functions for the evolutionary spectral clustering problems. Our solutions to the evolutionary spectral clustering problems provide more stable and consistent clustering results that are less sensitive to short-term noises while at the same time are adaptive to long-term cluster drifts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methods provide the optimal solutions to the relaxed versions of the corresponding evolutionaryk-means clustering problems. Performance experiments over a number of real and synthetic data sets illustrate our evolutionary spectral clustering methods provide more robust clustering results that are not sensitive to noise and can adapt to data drifts.", "authors": [{"name": "yun chi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350577988"}, {"name": "xiaodan song", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100579110"}, {"name": "dengyong zhou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329493422"}, {"name": "koji hino", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329489292"}, {"name": "belle l tseng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100582555"}], "title": "On evolutionary spectral clustering", "citations": [{"Name": "Nan Du ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yuan Zhang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kang Li ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jing Gao ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Supriya D.

Prior research on sequence mining has mostly focused on discovering local patterns appearing in a sequence. While interesting, these patterns do not give a comprehensive summary of the entire event sequence. Moreover, the number of patterns discovered can be large. In this article, we take an alternative approach and buildshortsummaries that describe an entire sequence, and discover local dependencies between event types.We formally define the summarization problem as an optimization problem that balances shortness of the summary with accuracy of the data description. We show that this problem can be solved optimally in polynomial time by using a combination of two dynamic-programming algorithms. We also explore more efficient greedy alternatives and demonstrate that they work well on large datasets. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets illustrate that our algorithms are efficient and produce high-quality results, and reveal interesting local structures in the data.", "authors": [{"name": "jerry kiernan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100130974"}, {"name": "evimaria terzi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100469792"}], "title": "Constructing comprehensive summaries of large event sequences", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "48\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "550\n", "Citation Count": "7\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Barbados", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm silicon valley lab", "city": "valley", "Name": "jerry kiernan"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "boston university boston ma", "city": "boston", "Name": "evimaria terzi"}]}}, "date": {"month": "November", "year": "2009"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Yoshua Bengio , Yves Grandvalet, No Unbiased Estimator of the Variance of K-Fold Cross-Validation, The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 5, p.1089-1105, 12/1/2004\n", "Bertsimas, D. and Popescu, I. 1998.

In particular, many complete and efficient algorithms for frequent closed set mining are now available. Generalizing such a task ton-ary relations (n\u2265 2) appears as a timely challenge. It may be important for many applications, for example, when adding the time dimension to the popularobjects\u00d7featuresbinary case. The generality of the task (no assumption being made on the relation arity or on the size of its attribute domains) makes it computationally challenging. We introduce an algorithm called Data-Peeler. From ann-ary relation, it extracts all closedn-sets satisfying given piecewise (anti) monotonic constraints. This new class of constraints generalizes both monotonic and antimonotonic constraints. Considering the special case of ternary relations, Data-Peeler outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms CubeMiner and Trias by orders of magnitude. These good performances must be granted to a new clever enumeration strategy allowing to efficiently enforce the closeness property. The relevance of the extracted closedn-sets is assessed on real-life 3-and 4-ary relations.

As a consequence, even if two solutions are thoroughly compared experimentally, it will often remain unclear whether both solutions tackle the same problem or, if they do, whether they agree in certain tacit assumptions and how such assumptions may influence the outcome of an algorithm. In this survey, we try to clarify: (i) the different problem definitions related to subspace clustering in general; (ii) the specific difficulties encountered in this field of research; (iii) the varying assumptions, heuristics, and intuitions forming the basis of different approaches; and (iv) how several prominent solutions tackle different problems.", "authors": [{"name": "hans-peter kriegel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100512920"}, {"name": "peer kroger", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332509808"}, {"name": "arthur zimek", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100325685"}], "title": "Clustering high-dimensional data: A survey on subspace clustering, pattern-based clustering, and correlation clustering", "citations": [{"Name": "M.

DOLPHIN gains efficiency by naturally merging together in a unified schema three strategies, namely the selection policy of objects to be maintained in main memory, usage of pruning rules, and similarity search techniques. Importantly, similarity search is accomplished by the algorithm without the need of preliminarily indexing the whole dataset, as other methods do.The algorithm is simple to implement and it can be used with any type of data, belonging to either metric or nonmetric spaces. Moreover, a modification to the basic method allows DOLPHIN to deal with the scenario in which the available buffer of main memory is smaller than its standard requirements. DOLPHIN has been compared with state-of-the-art distance-based outlier detection algorithms, showing that it is much more efficient.", "authors": [{"name": "fabrizio angiulli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100400419"}, {"name": "fabio fassetti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314493715"}], "title": "DOLPHIN: An efficient algorithm for mining distance-based outliers in very large datasets", "citations": [{"Name": "Lei Cao ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mingrui Wei ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Di Yang ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Elke A.

Motivated by this challenge, much effort has concentrated on developing scalable versions of machine learning algorithms. However, the cost of mining large datasets is not just computational; preparing the datasets into the \u201cright form\u201d so that learning algorithms can be applied is usually costly, due to the human labor that is typically required and a large number of choices in data preparation, which include selecting different subsets of data and aggregating data at different granularities. We make the key observation that, for a number of practically motivated problems, these choices can be defined using database queries and analyzed in an automatic and systematic manner. Specifically, we propose a new class of data-mining problem, calledbellwether analysis, in which the goal is to find a few query-defined predictors (e.g., first week sales of Peoria, IL of an item) that can be used to accurately predict the result of a target query (e.g., first year worldwide sales of the item) from a large number of queries that define candidate predictors. To make a prediction for a new item, the data needed to generate such predictors has to be collected (e.g., selling the new item in Peoria, IL for a week and collecting the sales data). A useful predictor is one that has high prediction accuracy and a low data-collection cost. We call such a cost-effective predictor abellwether.This article introduces bellwether analysis, which integrates database query processing and predictive modeling into a single framework, and provides scalable algorithms for large datasets that cannot fit in main memory. Through a series of extensive experiments, we show that bellwethers do exist in real-world databases, and that our computation techniques achieve good efficiency on large datasets.", "authors": [{"name": "bee-chung chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100108059"}, {"name": "raghu ramakrishnan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100290062"}, {"name": "jude w shavlik", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100551445"}, {"name": "pradeep tamma", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314494991"}], "title": "Bellwether analysis: Searching for cost-effective query-defined predictors in large databases", "citations": [{"Name": "Hongyu Guo ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Herna L.

Features include shared title words, journal name, coauthors, medical subject headings, language, affiliations, and author name features (middle initial, suffix, and prevalence in MEDLINE). Here we test the hypothesis that the Author-ity model will suffice to disambiguate author names for the vast majority of articles in MEDLINE.Methods: Enhancements include: (a) incorporating first names and their variants, email addresses, and correlations between specific last names and affiliation words; (b) new methods of generating large unbiased training sets; (c) new methods for estimating the prior probability; (d) a weighted least squares algorithm for correcting transitivity violations; and (e) a maximum likelihood based agglomerative algorithm for computing clusters of articles that represent inferred author-individuals.Results: Pairwise comparisons were computed for all author names on all 15.3 million articles in MEDLINE (2006 baseline), that share last name and first initial, to create Author-ity 2006, a database that has each name on each article assigned to one of 6.7 million inferred author-individual clusters. Recall is estimated at \u223c98.8&percnt;. Lumping (putting two different individuals into the same cluster) affects \u223c0.5&percnt; of clusters, whereas splitting (assigning articles written by the same individual to >1 cluster) affects \u223c2&percnt; of articles.Impact: The Author-ity model can be applied generally to other bibliographic databases. Author name disambiguation allows information retrieval and data integration to becomeperson-centered, not justdocument-centered, setting the stage for new data mining and social network tools that will facilitate the analysis of scholarly publishing and collaboration behavior.Availability:The Author-ity 2006 database is available for nonprofit academic research, and can be freely queried via http://arrowsmith.psych.uic.edu.", "authors": [{"name": "vetle i torvik", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100305270"}, {"name": "neil r smalheiser", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100103633"}], "title": "Author name disambiguation in MEDLINE", "citations": [{"Name": "Heather A.

Existing stream data clustering algorithms are generally based on an online-offline approach: The online component captures synopsis information from the data stream (thus, overcoming real-time and memory constraints) and the offline component generates clusters using the stored synopsis. The online-offline approach affects the overall performance of stream data clustering in various ways: the ease of deriving synopsis from streaming data; the complexity of data structure for storing and managing synopsis; and the frequency at which the offline component is used to generate clusters. In this article, we propose an algorithm that (1) computes and updates synopsis information in constant time; (2) allows users to discover clusters at multiple resolutions; (3) determines the right time for users to generate clusters from the synopsis information; (4) generates clusters of higher purity than existing algorithms; and (5) determines the right threshold function for density-based clustering based on the fading model of stream data. To the best of our knowledge, no existing data stream algorithms has all of these features. Experimental results show that our algorithm is able to detect arbitrarily shaped, evolving clusters with high quality.", "authors": [{"name": "li wan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384607520"}, {"name": "wee keong ng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81423593727"}, {"name": "xuan hong dang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351604516"}, {"name": "philip s yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350576309"}, {"name": "kuan zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81440595275"}], "title": "Density-based clustering of data streams at multiple resolutions", "citations": [{"Name": "Charlie Isaksson ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Margaret H.

Existing algorithms such as CluStream are based on thek-means algorithm. These clustering algorithms have difficulties finding clusters of arbitrary shapes and handling outliers. Further, they require the knowledge ofkand user-specified time window. To address these issues, this article proposesD-Stream, a framework for clustering stream data using a density-based approach.Our algorithm uses an online component that maps each input data record into a grid and an offline component that computes the grid density and clusters the grids based on the density. The algorithm adopts a density decaying technique to capture the dynamic changes of a data stream and a attraction-based mechanism to accurately generate cluster boundaries.Exploiting the intricate relationships among the decay factor, attraction, data density, and cluster structure, our algorithm can efficiently and effectively generate and adjust the clusters in real time. Further, a theoretically sound technique is developed to detect and remove sporadic grids mapped by outliers in order to dramatically improve the space and time efficiency of the system. The technique makes high-speed data stream clustering feasible without degrading the clustering quality. The experimental results show that our algorithm has superior quality and efficiency, can find clusters of arbitrary shapes, and can accurately recognize the evolving behaviors of real-time data streams.", "authors": [{"name": "li tu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81392613266"}, {"name": "yixin chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452602016"}], "title": "Stream data clustering based on grid density and attraction", "citations": [{"Name": "Huan Wang ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yanwei Yu ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Qin Wang ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yadong Wan", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "A density-based clustering structure mining algorithm for data streams", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Big Data", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jin-Yin Chen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hui-Hao He", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "A fast density-based data stream clustering algorithm with cluster centers self-determined for mixed data", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Amr Magdy ", "Country": "egypt", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mahmoud K.

Driven by the huge potential benefit of improving rankings of Web pages, many tricks have been attempted to boost page rankings. The most common way, which is known as link spam, is to make up some artificially designed link structures. Detecting link spam effectively is a big challenge. In this article, we develop novel and effective detection methods for link spam target pages using page farms. The essential idea is intuitive: whether a page is the beneficiary of link spam is reflected by how it collects its PageRank score. Technically, how a target page collects its PageRank score is modeled by a page farm, which consists of pages contributing a major portion of the PageRank score of the target page. We propose two spamicity measures based on page farms. They can be used as an effective measure to check whether the pages are link spam target pages. An empirical study using a newly available real dataset strongly suggests that our method is effective. It outperforms the state-of-the-art methods like SpamRank and SpamMass in both precision and recall.", "authors": [{"name": "bin zhou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81414608539"}, {"name": "jian pei", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100323054"}], "title": "Link spam target detection using page farms", "citations": [{"Name": "Alton Y.

These communities are inherent characteristics of human interaction in online social networks, as well as paper citation networks. Also, communities may evolve over time, due to changes to individuals' roles and social status in the network as well as changes to individuals' research interests. We present an innovative algorithm that deviates from the traditional two-step approach to analyze community evolutions. In the traditional approach, communities are first detected for each time slice, and then compared to determine correspondences. We argue that this approach is inappropriate in applications with noisy data. In this paper, we proposeFacetNetfor analyzing communities and their evolutions through a robustunifiedprocess. This novel framework will discover communities and capture their evolution with temporal smoothness given by historic community structures. Our approach relies on formulating the problem in terms of maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, where the community structure is estimated both by the observed networked data and by the prior distribution given by historic community structures. Then we develop an iterative algorithm, with proven low time complexity, which is guaranteed to converge to an optimal solution. We perform extensive experimental studies, on both synthetic datasets and real datasets, to demonstrate that our method discovers meaningful communities and provides additional insights not directly obtainable from traditional methods.", "authors": [{"name": "yu-ru lin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329490164"}, {"name": "yun chi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350577988"}, {"name": "shenghuo zhu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100413890"}, {"name": "hari sundaram", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100245977"}, {"name": "belle l tseng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100582555"}], "title": "Analyzing communities and their evolutions in dynamic social networks", "citations": [{"Name": "Sajid Yousuf Bhat ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Muhammad Abulaish", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nam P.

Our problem becomes identifying a small conductance subgraph containing many (but not necessarily all) members of the given seed set.

Our approach is marked by incremental expansion from the seeds with retrospective analysis to determine the ultimate boundaries of our community. We demonstrate how to increase the robustness of the general approach through bootstrapping multiple random partitions of the input set into seed and evaluation groups.We go beyond statistical comparisons against gold standards to careful subjective evaluations of our expanded communities. This process explains the causes of most disagreement between our expanded communities and our gold-standards\u2014arguing that our expansion methods provide more reliable communities than can be extracted from reference sources/gazetteers such as Wikipedia.", "authors": [{"name": "andrew mehler", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418594945"}, {"name": "steven skiena", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100248225"}], "title": "Expanding network communities from representative examples", "citations": [{"Name": "Isabel M.

This minimization problem is more fundamental than the problem of preventing the spread of contamination by removing nodes in a network. We introduce two definitions for the contamination degree of a network, accordingly define two contamination minimization problems, and propose methods for efficiently finding good approximate solutions to these problems on the basis of a naturally greedy strategy. Using large social networks, we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform conventional link-removal methods.

In addition to our own industry experience with real-life projects, controversies around several major public data mining competitions held recently such as the INFORMS 2010 Data Mining Challenge and the IJCNN 2011 Social Network Challenge are evidence that this issue is as relevant today as it has ever been. While acknowledging the importance and prevalence of leakage in both synthetic competitions and real-life data mining projects, existing literature has largely left this idea unexplored. What little has been said turns out not to be broad enough to cover more complex cases of leakage, such as those where the classical independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption is violated, that have been recently documented. In our new approach, these cases and others are explained by explicitly defining modeling goals and analyzing the broader framework of the data mining problem. The resulting definition enables us to derive general methodology for dealing with the issue. We show that it is possible to avoid leakage with a simple specific approach to data management followed by what we call a learn-predict separation, and present several ways of detecting leakage when the modeler has no control over how the data have been collected.

While changes in the properties of SEMG signals with respect to muscle fatigue have been reported in the literature, the large variation in these signals across different individuals makes the task of modeling and classification of SEMG signals challenging. Indeed, the variation in SEMG parameters from subject to subject creates differences in the data distribution. In this article, we propose two transfer learning frameworks based on the multisource domain adaptation methodology for detecting different stages of fatigue using SEMG signals, that addresses the distribution differences. In the proposed frameworks, the SEMG data of a subject represent a domain; data from multiple subjects in the training set form the multiple source domains and the test subject data form the target domain. SEMG signals are predominantly different in conditional probability distribution across subjects. The key feature of the first framework is a novel weighting scheme that addresses the conditional probability distribution differences across multiple domains (subjects) and the key feature of the second framework is a two-stage domain adaptation methodology which combines weighted data from multiple sources based on marginal probability differences (first stage) as well as conditional probability differences (second stage), with the target domain data. The weights for minimizing the marginal probability differences are estimated independently, while the weights for minimizing conditional probability differences are computed simultaneously by exploiting the potential interaction among multiple sources. We also provide a theoretical analysis on the generalization performance of the proposed multisource domain adaptation formulation using the weighted Rademacher complexity measure. We have validated the proposed frameworks on Surface ElectroMyoGram signals collected from 8 people during a fatigue-causing repetitive gripping activity. Comprehensive experiments on the SEMG dataset demonstrate that the proposed method improves the classification accuracy by 20&percnt; to 30&percnt; over the cases without any domain adaptation method and by 13&percnt; to 30&percnt; over existing state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.", "authors": [{"name": "rita chattopadhyay", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81458651656"}, {"name": "qian sun", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81551971256"}, {"name": "wei fan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367591181"}, {"name": "ian davidson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81488655446"}, {"name": "sethuraman panchanathan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81458648274"}, {"name": "jieping ye", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100042425"}], "title": "Multisource domain adaptation and its application to early detection of fatigue", "citations": [{"Name": "Caiming Xiong ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Scott McCloskey ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shao-Hang Hsieh ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jason J.

That is, what we know about the data greatly determines our expectations, and therefore, what results we would find interesting and/or surprising. Given new knowledge about the data, our expectations will change. Hence, in order to avoid redundant results, knowledge discovery algorithms ideally should follow such an iterative updating procedure.With this in mind, we introduce a well-founded approach for succinctly summarizing data with the most informative itemsets; using a probabilistic maximum entropy model, we iteratively find the itemset that provides us the most novel information\u2014that is, for which the frequency in the data surprises us the most\u2014and in turn we update our model accordingly. As we use the maximum entropy principle to obtain unbiased probabilistic models, and only include those itemsets that are most informative with regard to the current model, the summaries we construct are guaranteed to be both descriptive and nonredundant.The algorithm that we present, called mtv, can either discover the top-kmost informative itemsets, or we can employ either the Bayesian Information Criterion (bic) or the Minimum Description Length (mdl) principle to automatically identify the set of itemsets that together summarize the data well. In other words, our method will \u201ctell you what you need to know\u201d about the data. Importantly, it is a one-phase algorithm: rather than picking itemsets from a user-provided candidate set, itemsets and their supports are mined on-the-fly. To further its applicability, we provide an efficient method to compute the maximum entropy distribution using Quick Inclusion-Exclusion.Experiments on our method, using synthetic, benchmark, and real data, show that the discovered summaries are succinct, and correctly identify the key patterns in the data. The models they form attain high likelihoods, and inspection shows that they summarize the data well with increasingly specific, yet nonredundant itemsets.", "authors": [{"name": "michael mampaey", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329490462"}, {"name": "jilles vreeken", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81335499054"}, {"name": "nikolaj tatti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81363600602"}], "title": "Summarizing data succinctly with the most informative itemsets", "citations": [{"Name": "Geoffrey I.

When the input graph cannot fit in main memory, triangle listing requires random disk accesses that can incur prohibitively huge I/O cost. Some streaming, semistreaming, and sampling algorithms have been proposed but these are approximation algorithms. We propose an I/O-efficient algorithm for triangle listing.

Unlike numerical attributes, it is difficult to define a distance between pairs of values of a categorical attribute, since the values are not ordered. In this article, we propose a framework to learn a context-based distance for categorical attributes. The key intuition of this work is that the distance between two values of a categorical attributeAican be determined by the way in which the values of the other attributesAjare distributed in the dataset objects: if they are similarly distributed in the groups of objects in correspondence of the distinct values ofAia low value of distance is obtained. We propose also a solution to the critical point of the choice of the attributesAj. We validate our approach by embedding our distance learning framework in a hierarchical clustering algorithm. We applied it on various real world and synthetic datasets, both low and high-dimensional. Experimental results show that our method is competitive with respect to the state of the art of categorical data clustering approaches. We also show that our approach is scalable and has a low impact on the overall computational time of a clustering task.", "authors": [{"name": "dino ienco", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384618045"}, {"name": "ruggero g pensa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442618820"}, {"name": "rosa meo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100122006"}], "title": "From Context to Distance: Learning Dissimilarity for Categorical Data Clustering", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "90\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "16\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "862\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of torino", "city": null, "Name": "dino ienco"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of torino", "city": null, "Name": "ruggero g pensa"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of torino", "city": null, "Name": "rosa meo"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Laurent Bernaille , Renata Teixeira , Kave Salamatian, Early application identification, Proceedings of the 2006 ACM CoNEXT conference, December 04-07, 2006, Lisboa, Portugal[doi>10.1145/1368436.1368445]\n", "Jason But , Thuy Nguyen , Lawrence Stewart , Nigel Williams , Grenville Armitage, Performance analysis of the ANGEL system for automated control of game traffic prioritisation, Proceedings of the 6th ACM SIGCOMM workshop on Network and system support for games, p.123-128, September 19-20, 2007, Melbourne, Australia[doi>10.1145/1326257.1326279]\n", "Aiyou Chen , Yu Jin , Jin Cao , Li Erran Li, Tracking long duration flows in network traffic, Proceedings of the 29th conference on Information communications, p.206-210, March 14-19, 2010, San Diego, California, USA\n", "Manuel Crotti , Maurizio Dusi , Francesco Gringoli , Luca Salgarelli, Traffic classification through simple statistical fingerprinting, ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review, v.37 n.1, January 2007[doi>10.1145/1198255.1198257]\n", "Richard O.

Guided by the practical constraints and requirements of traffic classification in large networks, in this article, we explore the design of an accurate and scalable machine learning based flow-level traffic classification system, which is trained on a dataset of flow-level data that has been annotated with application protocol labels by a packet-level classifier. Our system employs a lightweightmodular architecture, which combines a series of simple linear binary classifiers, each of which can be efficiently implemented and trained on vast amounts of flow data in parallel, and embraces three key innovative mechanisms,weighted threshold sampling, logistic calibration, andintelligent data partitioning, to achieve scalability while attaining high accuracy. Evaluations using real traffic data from multiple locations in a large ISP show that our system accurately reproduces the labels of the packet level classifier when runs on (unlabeled) flow records, while meeting the scalability and stability requirements of large ISP networks. Using training and test datasets that are two months apart and collected from two different locations, the flow error rates are only 3&percnt; for TCP flows and 0.4&percnt; for UDP flows. We further show that such error rates can be reduced by combining the information of spatial distributions of flows, orcollective traffic statistics, during classification. We propose a novel two-step model, which seamlessly integrates these collective traffic statistics into the existing traffic classification system. Experimental results display performance improvement on all traffic classes and an overall error rate reduction by 15&percnt;.

In many application domains (e.g., biology), the frequent subsequences confined by the predefined gap requirements are more meaningful than the general sequential patterns. In this article, we propose two algorithms, Gap-BIDE for mining closed gap-constrained subsequences from a set of input sequences, and Gap-Connect for mining repetitive gap-constrained subsequences from a single input sequence. Inspired by some state-of-the-art closed or constrained sequential pattern mining algorithms, the Gap-BIDE algorithm adopts an efficient approach to finding the complete set of closed sequential patterns with gap constraints, while the Gap-Connect algorithm efficiently mines an approximate set of long patterns by connecting short patterns. We also present several methods for feature selection from the set of gap-constrained patterns for the purpose of classification and clustering. Our extensive performance study shows that our approaches are very efficient in mining frequent subsequences with gap constraints, and the gap-constrained pattern based classification/clustering approaches can achieve high-quality results.", "authors": [{"name": "chun li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339513129"}, {"name": "qingyan yang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81472646744"}, {"name": "jianyong wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451601319"}, {"name": "ming li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81381602704"}], "title": "Efficient Mining of Gap-Constrained Subsequences and Its Various Applications", "citations": [{"Name": "R.

Evolving graphs arise naturally in diverse applications such as computer network topologies, multiplayer games and medical imaging. A natural and interesting problem in evolving graph analysis is the discovery of compact subgraphs that change in a similar manner. Such subgraphs are known as regions of correlated change and they can both summarise change patterns in graphs and help identify the underlying events causing these changes. However, previous techniques for discovering regions of correlated change suffer from limited scalability, making them unsuitable for analysing the evolution of very large graphs. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm called ciForager, that addresses this scalability challenge and offers considerable improvements. The efficiency of ciForager is based on the use of new incremental techniques for detecting change, as well as the use of Voronoi representations for efficiently determining distance. We experimentally show that ciForager can achieve speedups of up to 1000 times over previous approaches. As a result, it becomes feasible for the first time to discover regions of correlated change in extremely large graphs, such as the entire BGP routing topology of the Internet.", "authors": [{"name": "jeffrey chan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81547996856"}, {"name": "james bailey", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100616144"}, {"name": "christopher leckie", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100389595"}, {"name": "michael houle", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100299673"}], "title": "ciForager: Incrementally discovering regions of correlated change in evolving graphs", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "34\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "327\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "australia", "university": "university of melbourne", "affiliation_string": "university of melbourne australia", "city": "melbourne", "Name": "jeffrey chan"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "university of melbourne", "affiliation_string": "university of melbourne australia", "city": "melbourne", "Name": "james bailey"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "university of melbourne", "affiliation_string": "university of melbourne australia", "city": "melbourne", "Name": "christopher leckie"}, {"country": "Japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of informatics tokyo japan", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "michael houle"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Diraitris Margaritis , Sebastian Thrun, A Bayesian multiresolution independence test for continuous variables, Proceedings of the Seventeenth conference on Uncertainty in artificial intelligence, p.346-353, August 02-05, 2001, Seattle, Washington\n", "Constantin F.

In practice, testing independence conditioning on large sets hampers the performance of dependency analysis algorithms in terms of accuracy and running time for the following reasons. First, testing independence on large sets of variables with limited samples is not stable. Second, for most dependency analysis algorithms, the number of CI tests grows at an exponential rate with the sizes of conditioning sets, and the running time grows of the same rate. Therefore, determining how to reduce the number of CI tests and the sizes of conditioning sets becomes a critical step in dependency analysis algorithms. In this article, we address a two-phase algorithm based on the observation that the structures of Markov random fields are similar to those of Bayesian networks. The first phase of the algorithm constructs a Markov random field from data, which provides a close approximation to the structure of the true Bayesian network; the second phase of the algorithm removes redundant edges according to CI tests to get the true Bayesian network. Both phases use Markov blanket information to reduce the sizes of conditioning sets and the number of CI tests without sacrificing accuracy. An empirical study shows that the two-phase algorithm performs well in terms of accuracy and efficiency.", "authors": [{"name": "zhenxing wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81461643480"}, {"name": "laiwan chan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81549270056"}], "title": "Learning bayesian networks from Markov random fields: An efficient algorithm for linear models", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "54\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "558\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "hong kong", "university": "university of hong kong", "affiliation_string": "the chinese university of hong kong", "city": "xianggangdao", "Name": "zhenxing wang"}, {"country": "hong kong", "university": "university of hong kong", "affiliation_string": "the chinese university of hong kong", "city": "xianggangdao", "Name": "laiwan chan"}]}, "Article No.: 12": {"references": ["Allan, J., Carbonell, J., Doddington, G., Yamron, J., and Yang, Y. 1998.

Even with the aid of an uncountable number of descriptive statistics and background information, only a few can correctly guess the outcome of a game or a league. In this work, our approach is to move away from the traditional way of predicting sports events, and instead to model sports leagues as networks of players and teams where the only information available is the work relationships among them. We propose two network-based models to predict the behavior of teams in sports leagues. These models are parameter-free, that is, they do not have a single parameter, and moreover are sport-agnostic: they can be applied directly to any team sports league. First, we view a sports league as a network in evolution, and we infer the implicit feedback behind network changes and properties over the years. Then, we use this knowledge to construct the network-based prediction models, which can, with a significantly high probability, indicate how well a team will perform over a season. We compare our proposed models with other prediction models in two of the most popular sports leagues: the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Major League Baseball (MLB). Our model shows consistently good results in comparison with the other models and, relying upon the network properties of the teams, we achieved a &ap; 14&percnt; rank prediction accuracy improvement over our best competitor.", "authors": [{"name": "pedro o s vaz de melo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81381601100"}, {"name": "virgilio a f almeida", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384595968"}, {"name": "antonio a f loureiro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100219450"}, {"name": "christos faloutsos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548006169"}], "title": "Forecasting in the NBA and other team sports: Network effects in action", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "167\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "20\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "817\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "brazil", "university": "universidade federal de minas gerais", "affiliation_string": "universidade federal de minas gerais", "city": "belo horizonte", "Name": "pedro o s vaz de melo"}, {"country": "brazil", "university": "universidade federal de minas gerais", "affiliation_string": "universidade federal de minas gerais", "city": "belo horizonte", "Name": "virgilio a f almeida"}, {"country": "brazil", "university": "universidade federal de minas gerais", "affiliation_string": "universidade federal de minas gerais", "city": "belo horizonte", "Name": "antonio a f loureiro"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university", "city": null, "Name": "christos faloutsos"}]}}, "date": {"month": "October", "year": "2012"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 9": {"references": ["Argyriou, A., Micchelli, C., and Pontil, M.2006.

We investigate if supervision can be automatically transferred for clustering a target task, by providing a relevant supervised partitioning of a dataset from a different source task. The target clustering is made more meaningful for the human user by trading-off intrinsic clustering goodness on the target task for alignment with relevant supervised partitions in the source task, wherever possible. We propose a cross-guided clustering algorithm that builds on traditional k-means by aligning the target clusters with source partitions. The alignment process makes use of a cross-task similarity measure that discovers hidden relationships across tasks. When the source and target tasks correspond to different domains with potentially different vocabularies, we propose a projection approach using pivot vocabularies for the cross-domain similarity measure. Using multiple real-world and synthetic datasets, we show that our approach improves clustering accuracy significantly over traditional k-means and state-of-the-art semi-supervised clustering baselines, over a wide range of data characteristics and parameter settings.", "authors": [{"name": "indrajit bhattacharya", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100376279"}, {"name": "shantanu godbole", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81336489465"}, {"name": "sachindra joshi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100641955"}, {"name": "ashish verma", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81335498908"}], "title": "Cross-Guided Clustering: Transfer of Relevant Supervision across Tasks", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "27\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "293\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "india", "university": "indian institute of science", "affiliation_string": "indian institute of science", "city": "bangalore", "Name": "indrajit bhattacharya"}, {"country": "india", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm research - india", "city": null, "Name": "shantanu godbole"}, {"country": "india", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm research - india", "city": null, "Name": "sachindra joshi"}, {"country": "india", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm research - india", "city": null, "Name": "ashish verma"}]}, "Article No.: 8": {"references": ["Ackley, D., Hinton, G., and Sejnowski, T.1985.

The principle oflatent maximum entropywe propose is different from both Jaynes\u2019 maximum entropy principle and maximum likelihood estimation, but can yield better estimates in the presence of hidden variables and limited training data. We first show that solving for a latent maximum entropy model poses a hard nonlinear constrained optimization problem in general. However, we then show that feasible solutions to this problem can be obtained efficiently for the special case of log-linear models---which forms the basis for an efficient approximation to the latent maximum entropy principle. We derive an algorithm that combines expectation-maximization with iterative scaling to produce feasible log-linear solutions. This algorithm can be interpreted as an alternating minimization algorithm in the information divergence, and reveals an intimate connection between the latent maximum entropy and maximum likelihood principles. To select a final model, we generate a series of feasible candidates, calculate the entropy of each, and choose the model that attains the highest entropy. Our experimental results show that estimation based on the latent maximum entropy principle generally gives better results than maximum likelihood when estimating latent variable models on small observed data samples.", "authors": [{"name": "shaojun wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451597400"}, {"name": "dale schuurmans", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100182569"}, {"name": "yunxin zhao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100536971"}], "title": "The Latent Maximum Entropy Principle", "citations": [{"Name": "Jingjing Wang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Min Li ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jiawei Han ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiaolong Wang", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ismael Garc\u00eda-Varea ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Francisco Casacuberta", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "45\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "415\n", "Citation Count": "4\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "wright state university", "city": null, "Name": "shaojun wang"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of alberta", "affiliation_string": "university of alberta", "city": "edmonton", "Name": "dale schuurmans"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of missouri at columbia", "city": null, "Name": "yunxin zhao"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Barabasi, A.

In this article, based on the recent literature on nonparametric Bayesian models, we have developed two generative models: DPChain and HDP-HTM. DPChain is derived from the Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) model, with an exponential decaying component along with the time. HDP-HTM combines the hierarchical dirichlet process (HDP) with a hierarchical transition matrix (HTM) based on the proposed Infinite hierarchical Markov state model (iHMS). Both models substantially advance the literature on evolutionary clustering, in the sense that not only do they both perform better than those in the existing literature, but more importantly, they are capable of automatically learning the cluster numbers and explicitly addressing the corresponding issues. Extensive evaluations have demonstrated the effectiveness and the promise of these two solutions compared to the state-of-the-art literature.", "authors": [{"name": "tianbing xu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81414604360"}, {"name": "zhongfei zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81507682451"}, {"name": "philip s yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350576309"}, {"name": "bo long", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375607652"}], "title": "Generative Models for Evolutionary Clustering", "citations": [{"Name": "Charu Aggarwal ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Karthik Subbian", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "67\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "14\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "574\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United Kingdom", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "state university of new york at binghamton", "city": "york", "Name": "tianbing xu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "philip s yu", "city": null, "Name": "zhongfei zhang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "bo long", "city": null, "Name": "university of illinois at chicago"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Ailon, N., Jaiswal, R., and Monteleoni, C.2009.

To this end, sampling has been studied by several researchers in an effort to derive sufficiently accurate models using only small data fractions. In this article we focus on spectralk-means, that is, thek-means approximation as derived by the spectral relaxation, and propose a sequential sampling framework that iteratively enlarges the sample size until thek-means results (objective function and cluster structure) become indistinguishable from the asymptotic (infinite-data) output. In the proposed framework we adopt a commonly applied principle in data mining research that considers the use of minimal assumptions concerning the data generating distribution. This restriction imposes several challenges, mainly related to the efficiency of the sequential sampling procedure. These challenges are addressed using elements of matrix perturbation theory and statistics. Moreover, although the main focus is on spectralk-means, we also demonstrate that the proposed framework can be generalized to handle spectral clustering.The proposed sequential sampling framework is consecutively employed for addressing the distributed clustering problem, where the task is to construct a global model for data that resides in distributed network nodes. The main challenge in this context is related to the bandwidth constraints that are commonly imposed, thus requiring that the distributed clustering algorithm consumes a minimal amount of network load. This illustrates the applicability of the proposed approach, as it enables the determination of a minimal sample size that can be used for constructing an accurate clustering model that entails the distributional characteristics of the data. As opposed to the relevant distributedk-means approaches, our framework takes into account the fact that the choice of the number of clusters has a crucial effect on the required amount of communication. More precisely, the proposed algorithm is able to derive a statistical estimation of the required relative sizes for all possible values ofk. This unique feature of our distributed clustering framework enables a network administrator to choose an economic solution that identifies the crude cluster structure of a dataset and not devote excessive network resources for identifying all the \u201ccorrect\u201d detailed clusters.", "authors": [{"name": "dimitrios mavroeidis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384612275"}, {"name": "panagis magdalinos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474694444"}], "title": "A Sequential Sampling Framework for Spectral k-Means Based on Efficient Bootstrap Accuracy Estimations: Application to Distributed Clustering", "citations": [{"Name": "Dimitrios Mavroeidis ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Elena Marchiori", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "37\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "490\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "radboud university nijmegen", "city": null, "Name": "dimitrios mavroeidis"}, {"country": "greece", "university": "university of athens", "affiliation_string": "national and kapodistrian university of athens", "city": "athens", "Name": "panagis magdalinos"}]}}, "date": {"month": "July", "year": "2012"}}}, "Volume10": {"Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 19": {"references": ["Sameer Agarwal , Yasutaka Furukawa , Noah Snavely , Ian Simon , Brian Curless , Steven M.

In order to reduce the number of candidates to search, locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) based indexing methods are very effective. However, most such methods only use LSH for the first phase of similarity search\u2014that is, efficient indexing for candidate generation. In this article, we presentBayesLSH, a principled Bayesian algorithm for the subsequent phase of similarity search\u2014performing candidate pruning and similarity estimation using LSH. A simpler variant,BayesLSH-Lite, which calculates similarities exactly, is also presented. Our algorithms are able to quickly prune away a large majority of the false positive candidate pairs, leading to significant speedups over baseline approaches. For BayesLSH, we also provide probabilistic guarantees on the quality of the output, both in terms of accuracy and recall. Finally, the quality of BayesLSH\u2019s output can be easily tuned and does not require any manual setting of the number of hashes to use for similarity estimation, unlike standard approaches. For two state-of-the-art candidate generation algorithms, AllPairs and LSH, BayesLSH enables significant speedups, typically in the range 2 \u00d7 --20 \u00d7 for a wide variety of datasets.We also extend the BayesLSH algorithm for kernel methods\u2014in which the similarity between two data objects is defined by a kernel function. Since the embedding of data points in the transformed kernel space is unknown, algorithms such as AllPairs which rely on building inverted index structure for fast similarity search do not work with kernel functions. Exhaustive search across all possible pairs is also not an option since the dataset can be huge and computing the kernel values for each pair can be prohibitive. We proposeK-BayesLSHan all-pairs similarity search problem for kernel functions. K-BayesLSH leverages a recently proposed idea\u2014kernelized locality sensitive hashing(KLSH)\u2014for hash bit computation and candidate generation, and uses the aforementioned BayesLSH idea for candidate pruning and similarity estimation. We ran a broad spectrum of experiments on a variety of datasets drawn from different domains and with distinct kernels and find a speedup of 2 \u00d7 --7 \u00d7 over vanilla KLSH.", "authors": [{"name": "aniket chakrabarti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81551096756"}, {"name": "venu satuluri", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375618822"}, {"name": "atreya srivathsan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658754997"}, {"name": "srinivasan parthasarathy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100375834"}], "title": "A Bayesian Perspective on Locality Sensitive Hashing with Extensions for Kernel Methods", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "149\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "18\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "149\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the ohio state university", "city": null, "Name": "aniket chakrabarti"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "atreya srivathsan", "city": null, "Name": "venu satuluri"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "srinivasan parthasarathy", "city": null, "Name": "amazoncom inc"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "venu satuluri", "city": null, "Name": "the ohio state university"}]}, "Article No.: 15": {"references": ["Evrim Acar , Daniel M.

We present new similarity measures ASCOS and ASCOS++ to address the problem. ASCOS outputs a more complete similarity score than SimRank and SimRank\u2019s families. ASCOS++ enriches ASCOS to include edge weight into the measure, giving all edges and network weights an opportunity to make their contribution. We show that both ASCOS++ and ASCOS can be reformulated and applied on a distributed environment for parallel contribution. Experimental results show that ASCOS++ reports a better score than SimRank and several famous similarity measures. Finally, we re-examine previous use cases of SimRank, and explain appropriate and inappropriate use cases.

Most studies in this field usesupport(frequency) to measure thepopularityof a pattern, namely the fraction of transactions or sequences that include the pattern in a data set. In this study, we introduce a new interesting measure, namely occupancy, to measure thecompletenessof a pattern in its supporting transactions or sequences. This is motivated by some real-world pattern recommendation applications in which an interesting pattern should not only be frequent, but also occupies a large portion of its supporting transactions or sequences. With the definition of occupancy we call a patterndominantif its occupancy value is above a user-specified threshold. Then, our task is to identify thequalified patternswhich are both dominant and frequent. Also, we formulate the problem ofmining top-k qualified patterns, that is, findingkqualified patterns with maximum values on a user-defined function of support and occupancy, for example, weighted sum of support and occupancy. The challenge to these tasks is that the value of occupancy does not change monotonically when more items are appended to a given pattern. Therefore, we propose a general algorithm called DOFRA (DOminant and FRequent pattern mining Algorithm) for mining these qualified patterns, which explores the upper bound properties on occupancy to drastically reduce the search process. Finally, we show the effectiveness of DOFRA in two real-world applications and also demonstrate the efficiency of DOFRA on several real and large synthetic datasets.", "authors": [{"name": "lei zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81547967356"}, {"name": "ping luo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100416055"}, {"name": "linpeng tang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81501669442"}, {"name": "enhong chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323488612"}, {"name": "qi liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83358683257"}, {"name": "min wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82659038357"}, {"name": "hui xiong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451596433"}], "title": "Occupancy-Based Frequent Pattern Mining&ast;", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "208\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "21\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "208\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "china", "university": "anhui university", "affiliation_string": "anhui university anhui province china", "city": "hefei", "Name": "lei zhang"}, {"country": "China", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of chinese academy of sciences beijing china", "city": "beijing", "Name": "ping luo"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "princeton university princeton usa", "city": null, "Name": "linpeng tang"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "university of science and technology of china anhui china", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "enhong chen"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "university of science and technology of china anhui china", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "qi liu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "google research ca usa", "city": null, "Name": "min wang"}, {"country": "Jersey", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "rutgers the state university of new jersey newark usa", "city": "jersey", "Name": "hui xiong"}]}, "Article No.: 16": {"references": ["Ahmed Abbasi , Hsinchun Chen, Applying Authorship Analysis to Extremist-Group Web Forum Messages, IEEE Intelligent Systems, v.20 n.5, p.67-75, September 2005[doi>10.1109/MIS.2005.81]\n", "Charu C.

The information on each site is often partial. When sources of complementary information are integrated, a better profile of a user can be built. This profile can help improve online services such as advertising across sites. To integrate these sources of information, it is necessary to identify individuals across social media sites. This paper aims to address the cross-media user identification problem. We provide evidence on the existence of a mapping among identities of individuals across social media sites, study the feasibility of finding this mapping, and illustrate and develop means for finding this mapping. Our studies show that effective approaches that exploit information redundancies due to users\u2019 unique behavioral patterns can be utilized to find such a mapping. This study paves the way for analysis and mining across social networking sites, and facilitates the creation of novel online services across sites. In particular, recommending friends and advertising across networks, analyzing information diffusion across sites, and studying specific user behavior such as user migration across sites in social media are one of the many areas that can benefit from the results of this study.", "authors": [{"name": "reza zafarani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309493801"}, {"name": "lei tang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81363600542"}, {"name": "huan liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367594306"}], "title": "User Identification Across Social Media", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "399\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "58\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "399\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "syracuse university", "city": null, "Name": "reza zafarani"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "huan liu", "city": null, "Name": "lei tang"}]}, "Article No.: 12": {"references": ["N Alon, Eigen values and expanders, Combinatorica, v.6 n.2, p.83-96, 1986[doi>10.1007/BF02579166]\n", "B.

While in the traditional graph theory, the focus is on well-defined properties of graph connectivity, such as biconnectivity, in the context of asocial graph, connectivity is typically manifested by its ability to carry onsocial processes. In this paper, we consider the problem of adding a small set of nonexisting edges (shortcuts) in a social graph with the main objective of minimizing itscharacteristic path length. This property determines the average distance between pairs of vertices and essentially controls how broadly information can propagate through a network. We formally define the problem of interest, characterize its hardness and propose a novel method,path screening, which quickly identifies important shortcuts to guide the augmentation of the graph. We devise a sampling-based variant of our method that can scale up the computation in larger graphs. The claims of our methods are formally validated. Through experiments on real and synthetic data, we demonstrate that our methods area multitude of timesfaster than standard approaches, their accuracy outperforms sensible baselines and they can ease the spread of information in a network, for a varying range of conditions.", "authors": [{"name": "manos papagelis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81361603298"}], "title": "Refining Social Graph Connectivity via Shortcut Edge Addition", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "179\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "179\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "canada", "university": "university of toronto", "affiliation_string": "university of toronto toronto on canada", "city": "toronto", "Name": "manos papagelis"}]}, "Article No.: 20": {"references": ["Roy M.

Most previous works for controlling propagation (say via immunization) have concentrated on developing strategies for vaccinationpreemptivelybefore the start of the epidemic. While very useful to provide insights in to which baseline policies can best control an infection, they may not be ideal to makereal-timedecisions as the infection is progressing.In this paper, we study how to immunize healthy nodes, in the presence of already infected nodes. Efficient algorithms for such a problem can help public-health experts make more informed choices, tailoring their decisions to the actual distribution of the epidemic on the ground. First we formulate theData-Aware Vaccinationproblem, and prove it is NP-hard and also that it is hard to approximate. Secondly, we propose three effective polynomial-time heuristics DAVA, DAVA-prune and DAVA-fast, of varying degrees of efficiency and performance. Finally, we also demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our algorithms through extensive experiments on multiple real networks including large epidemiology datasets (containing millions of interactions). Our algorithms show substantial gains of up toten timesmore healthy nodes at the end against many other intuitive and nontrivial competitors.", "authors": [{"name": "yao zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658634156"}, {"name": "b aditya prakash", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81414613593"}], "title": "Data-Aware Vaccine Allocation Over Large Networks", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "154\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "18\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "154\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "virginia tech blacksburg usa", "city": null, "Name": "yao zhang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "virginia tech blacksburg usa", "city": null, "Name": "b aditya prakash"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["Gediminas Adomavicius, Bamshad Mobasher, Francesco Ricci, and Alex Tuzhilin. 2011.

As user interests can be affected by context at any time and any place in mobile scenarios, rich context information becomes more and more important for personalized context-aware recommendations. Although existing context-aware recommender systems can make context-aware recommendations to some extent, they suffer several inherent weaknesses: (1) Users\u2019 context-aware interests are not modeled realistically, which reduces the recommendation quality; (2) Current context-aware recommender systems ignore trust relations among users. Trust relations are actually context-aware and associated with certain aspects (i.e., categories of items) in mobile scenarios. In this article, we define a termroleto model common context-aware interests among a group of users. We propose an efficient role mining algorithm to mine roles from a \u201cuser-context-behavior\u201d matrix, and a role-based trust model to calculate context-aware trust value between two users. During online recommendation, given a useruin a contextc, an efficient weighted set similarity query (WSSQ) algorithm is designed to buildu\u2019srole-based trust networkin contextc. Finally, we make recommendations toubased onu\u2019s role-based trust network by considering both context-aware roles and trust relations.

In MOGs, rich social relationships emerge and can be used to improve gaming services such as match recommendation and game population retention, which are important for the user experience and the commercial value of the companies who run these MOGs. In this work, we focus on understanding social relationships in MOGs. We propose a graph model that is able to capture social relationships of a variety of types and strengths. We apply our model to real-world data collected from three MOGs that contain in total over ten years of behavioral history for millions of players and matches. We compare social relationships in MOGs across different game genres and with regular online social networks like Facebook. Taking match recommendation as an example application of our model, we propose SAMRA, a Socially Aware Match Recommendation Algorithm that takes social relationships into account. We show that our model not only improves the precision of traditional link prediction approaches, but also potentially helps players enjoy games to a higher extent.", "authors": [{"name": "adele lu jia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548007963"}, {"name": "siqi shen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81498642376"}, {"name": "ruud van de bovenkamp", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81504688062"}, {"name": "alexandru iosup", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314482978"}, {"name": "fernando kuipers", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100656645"}, {"name": "dick h j epema", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100248187"}], "title": "Socializing by Gaming: Revealing Social Relationships in Multiplayer Online Games", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "288\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "51\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "288\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "netherlands", "university": "delft university of technology", "affiliation_string": "delft university of technology", "city": "delft", "Name": "adele lu jia"}, {"country": "netherlands", "university": "delft university of technology", "affiliation_string": "delft university of technology", "city": "delft", "Name": "siqi shen"}, {"country": "netherlands", "university": "delft university of technology", "affiliation_string": "delft university of technology", "city": "delft", "Name": "ruud van de bovenkamp"}, {"country": "netherlands", "university": "delft university of technology", "affiliation_string": "delft university of technology", "city": "delft", "Name": "alexandru iosup"}, {"country": "netherlands", "university": "delft university of technology", "affiliation_string": "delft university of technology", "city": "delft", "Name": "fernando kuipers"}, {"country": "netherlands", "university": "delft university of technology", "affiliation_string": "delft university of technology", "city": "delft", "Name": "dick h j epema"}]}, "Article No.: 18": {"references": ["Edoardo M.

Therefore, it is valuable to study the collective behavior of individuals and detect group anomalies. Existing group anomaly detection approaches rely on the assumption that the groups are known, which can hardly be true in real world social media applications. In this article, we take a generative approach by proposing a hierarchical Bayes model:Group Latent Anomaly Detection(GLAD) model. GLAD takes both pairwise and point-wise data as input, automatically infers the groups and detects group anomalies simultaneously. To account for the dynamic properties of the social media data, we further generalize GLAD to its dynamic extension d-GLAD. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our models on both synthetic and real world datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that our approach is effective and robust in discovering latent groups and detecting group anomalies.", "authors": [{"name": "rose yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658633904"}, {"name": "xinran he", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658631595"}, {"name": "yan liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418597820"}], "title": "GLAD: Group Anomaly Detection in Social Media Analysis", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "174\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "32\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "174\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Hong Kong", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of southern california", "city": "southern", "Name": "rose yu"}, {"country": "Hong Kong", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of southern california", "city": "southern", "Name": "xinran he"}, {"country": "Hong Kong", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of southern california", "city": "southern", "Name": "yan liu"}]}, "Article No.: 17": {"references": ["Mohammad Al Hasan, Vineet Chaoji, Saeed Salem, and Mohammed Zaki. 2006.

Rich user-generated information, for example, users\u2019 relationships and daily posts, are often available in most social media service websites. Given such information, a challenging problem is to provide reasonable user and community recommendation for a target user, and consequently, help the target user engage in the daily discussions and activities with his/her friends or like-minded people. In this article, we propose a unified framework of recommending users and communities that utilizes the information in social media. Given a user\u2019s profile or a set of keywords as input, our framework is capable of recommending influential users and topic-cohesive interactive communities that are most relevant to the given user or keywords. With the proposed framework, users can find other individuals or communities sharing similar interests, and then have more interaction with these users or within the communities. We present a generative topic model to discover user-oriented and community-oriented topics simultaneously, which enables us to capture the exact topical interests of users, as well as the focuses of communities. Extensive experimental evaluation and case studies on a dataset collected from Twitter demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework compared with other probabilistic-topic-model-based recommendation methods.", "authors": [{"name": "lei li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81466644374"}, {"name": "wei peng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81407593700"}, {"name": "saurabh kataria", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435592378"}, {"name": "tong sun", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81547604256"}, {"name": "tao li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100475528"}], "title": "Recommending Users and Communities in Social Media", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "266\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "42\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "266\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "philippines", "university": "national university", "affiliation_string": "school of computer science  technology nanjing university of posts and telecommunications njupt  school of computing and information sciences florida international university miami fl usa", "city": "manila", "Name": "lei li"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "xerox corporation webster ny", "city": null, "Name": "wei peng"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "xerox corporation webster ny", "city": null, "Name": "saurabh kataria"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "xerox corporation webster ny", "city": null, "Name": "tong sun"}, {"country": "philippines", "university": "national university", "affiliation_string": "school of computer science  technology nanjing university of posts and telecommunications njupt  school of computing and information sciences florida international university miami fl usa", "city": "manila", "Name": "tao li"}]}}, "date": {"month": "October", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 8": {"references": ["Rie Kubota Ando , Tong Zhang, A Framework for Learning Predictive Structures from Multiple Tasks and Unlabeled Data, The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 6, p.1817-1853, 12/1/2005\n", "Andreas Argyriou, Theodoros Evgeniou, and Massimiliano Pontil. 2006.

However, there are many related tasks in the real world, which motivates multitask clustering. Recently some multitask clustering algorithms have been proposed, and among them multitask Bregman clustering (MBC) is a very applicable method. MBC alternatively updates clusters and learns relationships between clusters of different tasks, and the two phases boost each other. However, the boosting does not always have positive effects on improving the clustering performance, it may also cause negative effects. Another issue of MBC is that it cannot deal with nonlinear separable data. In this article, we show that in MBC, the process of using cluster relationship to boost the cluster updating phase may cause negative effects, that is, cluster centroids may be skewed under some conditions. We propose a smart multitask Bregman clustering (S-MBC) algorithm which can identify the negative effects of the boosting and avoid the negative effects if they occur. We then propose a multitask kernel clustering (MKC) framework for nonlinear separable data by using a similar framework like MBC in the kernel space. We also propose a specific optimization method, which is quite different from that of MBC, to implement the MKC framework. Since MKC can also cause negative effects like MBC, we further extend the framework of MKC to a smart multitask kernel clustering (S-MKC) framework in a similar way that S-MBC is extended from MBC. We conduct experiments on 10 real world multitask clustering datasets to evaluate the performance of S-MBC and S-MKC. The results on clustering accuracy show that: (1) compared with the original MBC algorithm MBC, S-MBC and S-MKC perform much better; (2) compared with the convex discriminative multitask relationship clustering (DMTRC) algorithms DMTRC-L and DMTRC-R which also avoid negative transfer, S-MBC and S-MKC perform worse in the (ideal) case in which different tasks have the same cluster number and the empirical label marginal distribution in each task distributes evenly, but better or comparable in other (more general) cases. Moreover, S-MBC and S-MKC can work on the datasets in which different tasks have different number of clusters, violating the assumptions of DMTRC-L and DMTRC-R. The results on efficiency show that S-MBC and S-MKC consume more computational time than MBC and less computational time than DMTRC-L and DMTRC-R. Overall S-MBC and S-MKC are competitive compared with the state-of-the-art multitask clustering algorithms in synthetical terms of accuracy, efficiency and applicability.", "authors": [{"name": "xianchao zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100117870"}, {"name": "xiaotong zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658729508"}, {"name": "han liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658729240"}], "title": "Smart Multitask Bregman Clustering and Multitask Kernel Clustering", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "150\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "16\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "150\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "china", "university": "dalian university of technology", "affiliation_string": "dalian university of technology dalian china", "city": "dalian", "Name": "xianchao zhang"}, {"country": "china", "university": "dalian university of technology", "affiliation_string": "dalian university of technology dalian china", "city": "dalian", "Name": "xiaotong zhang"}, {"country": "china", "university": "dalian university of technology", "affiliation_string": "dalian university of technology dalian china", "city": "dalian", "Name": "han liu"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Leman Akoglu , Hanghang Tong , Jilles Vreeken , Christos Faloutsos, Fast and reliable anomaly detection in categorical data, Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management, October 29-November 02, 2012, Maui, Hawaii, USA[doi>10.1145/2396761.2396816]\n", "S.

In this article, we study rationality from the perspective of user decision on visiting a point of interest (POI) which is represented as a trajectory. However, the analysis of rationality is challenged by a number of issues, for example, how to model a trajectory in terms of complex user decision processes? and how to detect hidden factors that have significant impact on the rational decision making? In this study, we propose Rationality Analysis Model (RAM) to analyze rationality from trajectories in terms of a set of impact factors. In order to automatically identify hidden factors, we propose a method, Collective Hidden Factor Retrieval (CHFR), which can also be generalized to parse multiple trajectories at the same time or parse individual trajectories of different time periods. Extensive experimental study is conducted on three large-scale real-life datasets (i.e., taxi trajectories, user shopping trajectories, and visiting trajectories in a theme park). The results show that the proposed methods are efficient, effective, and scalable. We also deploy a system in a large theme park to conduct a field study. Interesting findings and user feedback of the field study are provided to support other applications in user behavior mining and analysis, such as business intelligence and user management for marketing purposes.", "authors": [{"name": "siyuan liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=88159345257"}, {"name": "qiang qu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658740276"}, {"name": "shuhui wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84459903357"}], "title": "Rationality Analytics from Trajectories", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "230\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "21\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "230\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "smeal college of business pennsylvania state university", "city": null, "Name": "siyuan liu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "department of computer science innopolis university", "city": null, "Name": "qiang qu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "key lab of intellectual information processing institute of computing technology chinese academy of sciences", "city": null, "Name": "shuhui wang"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Tatsuya Asai, Kenji Abe, Shinji Kawasoe, Hiroki Arimura, Hiroshi Sakamoto, and Setsuo Arikawa. 2002.

Modeling and revealing the information propagation patterns in microblogging services cannot only lead to more accurate understanding of user behaviors and provide insights into the underlying sociology, but also enable useful applications such as trending prediction, recommendation and filtering, spam detection and viral marketing. In this article, we aim to reveal the information propagation patterns in Sina Weibo, the biggest microblogging service in China. First, the cascade of each message is represented as a tree based on its retweeting process. Afterwards, we divide the information propagation pattern into two levels, that is, the macro level and the micro level. On one hand, the macro propagation patterns refer to general propagation modes that are extracted by grouping propagation trees based on hierarchical clustering. On the other hand, the micro propagation patterns are frequent information flow patterns that are discovered using tree-based mining techniques. Experimental results show that several interesting patterns are extracted, such as popular message propagation, artificial propagation, and typical information flows between different types of users.", "authors": [{"name": "zhiwen yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375594776"}, {"name": "zhu wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81461643443"}, {"name": "huilei he", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87059342957"}, {"name": "jilei tian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81551048056"}, {"name": "xinjiang lu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84459957757"}, {"name": "bin guo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81479657949"}], "title": "Discovering Information Propagation Patterns in Microblogging Services", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "320\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "30\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "320\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "China", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "northwestern polytechnical university shaanxi china", "city": "shaanxi", "Name": "zhiwen yu"}, {"country": "China", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "northwestern polytechnical university shaanxi china", "city": "shaanxi", "Name": "zhu wang"}, {"country": "China", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "northwestern polytechnical university shaanxi china", "city": "shaanxi", "Name": "huilei he"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "xinjiang lu", "city": null, "Name": "jilei tian"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "zhu wang", "city": null, "Name": "northwestern polytechnical university shaanxi china"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "zhu wang", "city": null, "Name": "northwestern polytechnical university shaanxi china"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["2010. http://www.emarketer.com/.\n", "Lada A.

It is well known that people influence one another based on both their social connections and the social activities that they have engaged in the past. In this article, we develop an innovative and high-performance social influence based graph clustering framework with four unique features. First, we explicitly distinguish social connection based influence (self-influence) and social activity based influence (co-influence). We compute the self-influence similarity between two members based on their social connections within a single collaboration network, and compute the co-influence similarity by taking into account not only the set of activities that people participate but also the semantic association between these activities. Second, we define the concept of influence-based similarity by introducing a unified influence-based similarity matrix that employs an iterative weight update method to integrate self-influence and co-influence similarities. Third, we design a dynamic learning algorithm, called SI-Cluster, for social influence based graph clustering. It iteratively partitions a large social collaboration network intoKclusters based on both the social network itself and the multiple associated activity information networks, each representing a category of activities that people have engaged. To make the SI-Clusteralgorithm converge fast, we transform sophisticated nonlinear fractional programming problem with respect to multiple weights into a straightforward nonlinear parametric programming problem of single variable. Finally, we develop an optimization technique of diagonalizable-matrix approximation to speed up the computation of self-influence similarity and co-influence similarities. Our SI-Cluster-Opt significantly improves the efficiency of SI-Cluster on large graphs while maintaining high quality of clustering results. Extensive experimental evaluation on three real-world graphs shows that, compared to existing representative graph clustering algorithms, our SI-Cluster-Optapproach not only achieves a very good balance between self-influence and co-influence similarities but also scales extremely well for clustering large graphs in terms of time complexity while meeting the guarantee of high density, low entropy and low Davies--Bouldin Index.", "authors": [{"name": "yang zhou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82658664657"}, {"name": "ling liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350573402"}], "title": "Social Influence Based Clustering and Optimization over Heterogeneous Information Networks", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "358\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "32\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "358\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Georgia", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "college of computing georgia institute of technology atlanta ga", "city": "georgia", "Name": "yang zhou"}, {"country": "Georgia", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "college of computing georgia institute of technology atlanta ga", "city": "georgia", "Name": "ling liu"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["Nuria Bel, Cornelis H.

As a result, it becomes more and more important to manage and mine information contained in Web pages in different languages. Traditional supervised learning methods usually require a large amount of training data to obtain accurate and robust classification models. However, labeled Web pages did not increase as fast as the growth of Internet. The lack of sufficient training Web pages in many languages, especially for those in uncommonly used languages, makes it a challenge for traditional classification algorithms to achieve satisfactory performance. To address this, we observe that Web pages for a same topic from different languages usually share some common semantic patterns, though in different representation forms. In addition, we also observe that the associations between word clusters and Web page classes are another type of reliable carriers to transfer knowledge across languages. With these recognitions, in this article we propose a novel joint nonnegative matrix trifactorization (NMTF) based Dual Knowledge Transfer (DKT) approach for cross-language Web page classification. Our approach transfers knowledge from the auxiliary language, in which abundant labeled Web pages are available, to the target languages, in which we want to classify Web pages, through two different paths: word cluster approximation and the associations between word clusters and Web page classes. With the reinforcement between these two different knowledge transfer paths, our approach can achieve better classification accuracy. In order to deal with the large-scale real world data, we further develop the proposed DKT approach by constraining the factor matrices of NMTF to be cluster indicator matrices. Due to the nature of cluster indicator matrices, we can decouple the proposed optimization objective and the resulted subproblems are of much smaller sizes involving much less matrix multiplications, which make our new approach much more computationally efficient. We evaluate the proposed approach in extensive experiments using a real world cross-language Web page data set. Promising results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach that are consistent with our theoretical analyses.", "authors": [{"name": "hua wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81467658260"}, {"name": "feiping nie", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81365596650"}, {"name": "heng huang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81336489675"}], "title": "Large-Scale Cross-Language Web Page Classification via Dual Knowledge Transfer Using Fast Nonnegative Matrix Trifactorization", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "201\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "23\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "201\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "colorado school of mines", "city": null, "Name": "hua wang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of texas at arlington", "city": null, "Name": "feiping nie"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of texas at arlington", "city": null, "Name": "heng huang"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Naoki Abe , Bianca Zadrozny , John Langford, Outlier detection by active learning, Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining, August 20-23, 2006, Philadelphia, PA, USA[doi>10.1145/1150402.1150459]\n", "Elke Achtert , Hans-Peter Kriegel , Erich Schubert , Arthur Zimek, Interactive data mining with 3D-parallel-coordinate-trees, Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, June 22-27, 2013, New York, New York, USA[doi>10.1145/2463676.2463696]\n", "Charu C.

The main module consists of an algorithm to compute hierarchical estimates of the level sets of a density, following Hartigan\u2019s classic model of density-contour clusters and trees. Such an algorithm generalizes and improves existing density-based clustering techniques with respect to different aspects. It provides as a result a complete clustering hierarchy composed of all possible density-based clusters following the nonparametric model adopted, for an infinite range of density thresholds. The resulting hierarchy can be easily processed so as to provide multiple ways for data visualization and exploration. It can also be further postprocessed so that: (i) a normalized score of \u201coutlierness\u201d can be assigned to each data object, which unifies both the global and local perspectives of outliers into a single definition; and (ii) a \u201cflat\u201d (i.e., nonhierarchical) clustering solution composed of clusters extracted from local cuts through the cluster tree (possibly corresponding to different density thresholds) can be obtained, either in an unsupervised or in a semisupervised way. In the unsupervised scenario, the algorithm corresponding to this postprocessing module provides a global, optimal solution to the formal problem of maximizing the overall stability of the extracted clusters. If partially labeled objects or instance-level constraints are provided by the user, the algorithm can solve the problem by considering both constraints violations/satisfactions and cluster stability criteria. An asymptotic complexity analysis, both in terms of running time and memory space, is described. Experiments are reported that involve a variety of synthetic and real datasets, including comparisons with state-of-the-art, density-based clustering and (global and local) outlier detection methods.", "authors": [{"name": "ricardo j g b campello", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100307349"}, {"name": "davoud moulavi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81500665209"}, {"name": "arthur zimek", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100325685"}, {"name": "jorg sander", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351602082"}], "title": "Hierarchical Density Estimates for Data Clustering, Visualization, and Outlier Detection", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "659\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "70\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "659\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Brazil", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "department of computer sciences university of sao paulo brazil", "city": "sao paulo", "Name": "ricardo j g b campello"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of alberta", "affiliation_string": "department of computing science university of alberta canada", "city": "edmonton", "Name": "davoud moulavi"}, {"country": "germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ludwig-maximilians-universitat munchen germany", "city": null, "Name": "arthur zimek"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of alberta", "affiliation_string": "department of computing science university of alberta canada", "city": "edmonton", "Name": "jorg sander"}]}, "Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Evrim Acar , Canan Aykut-Bingol , Haluk Bingol , Rasmus Bro , B\u00fclent Yener, Multiway analysis of epilepsy tensors, Bioinformatics, v.23 n.13, p.i10-i18, July 2007[doi>10.1093/bioinformatics/btm210]\n", "C.

Tensor decompositions have gained a steadily increasing popularity in data-mining applications; however, the current state-of-art decomposition algorithms operate on main memory and do not scale to truly large datasets. In this work, we propose ParCube, a new and highly parallelizable method for speeding up tensor decompositions that is well suited to produce sparse approximations. Experiments with even moderately large data indicate over 90&percnt; sparser outputs and 14 times faster execution, with approximation error close to the current state of the art irrespective of computation and memory requirements. We provide theoretical guarantees for the algorithm\u2019s correctness and we experimentally validate our claims through extensive experiments, including four different real world datasets (Enron, Lbnl, Facebookand Nell), demonstrating its effectiveness for data-mining practitioners. In particular, we are the first to analyze the very large Nelldataset using a sparse tensor decomposition, demonstrating that ParCubeenables us to handle effectively and efficiently very large datasets.

An obvious SATC strategy is to rankDso that the documents that the classifier has labelled with the lowest confidence are top ranked. In this work, we show that this strategy is suboptimal. We develop new utility-theoretic ranking methods based on the notion ofvalidation gain, defined as the improvement in classification effectiveness that would derive by validating a given automatically labelled document. We also propose a new effectiveness measure for SATC-oriented ranking methods, based on the expected reduction in classification error brought about by partially validating a list generated by a given ranking method. We report the results of experiments showing that, with respect to the baseline method mentioned earlier, and according to the proposed measure, our utility-theoretic ranking methods can achieve substantially higher expected reductions in classification error.", "authors": [{"name": "giacomo berardi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548013059"}, {"name": "andrea esuli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309512045"}, {"name": "fabrizio sebastiani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81541678556"}], "title": "Utility-Theoretic Ranking for Semiautomated Text Classification", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "120\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "12\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "120\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "andrea esuli", "city": null, "Name": "giacomo berardi"}, {"country": "Qatar", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "qatar computing research institute doha qatar", "city": "doha", "Name": "fabrizio sebastiani"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Rezwan Ahmed and George Karypis. 2012.

This article introduces a new class of dynamic graph patterns, referred to as coevolving relational motifs (CRMs), which are designed to identify recurring sets of entities whose relations change in a consistent way over time. CRMs can provide evidence to the existence of, possibly unknown, coordination mechanisms by identifying the relational motifs that evolve in a similar and highly conserved fashion. We developed an algorithm to efficiently analyze the frequent relational changes between the entities of the dynamic networks and capture all frequent coevolutions as CRMs. Our algorithm follows a depth-first exploration of the frequent CRM lattice and incorporates canonical labeling for redundancy elimination. Experimental results based on multiple real world dynamic networks show that the method is able to efficiently identify CRMs. In addition, a qualitative analysis of the results shows that the discovered patterns can be used as features to characterize the dynamic network.", "authors": [{"name": "rezwan ahmed", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384611558"}, {"name": "george karypis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100008465"}], "title": "Algorithms for Mining the Coevolving Relational Motifs in Dynamic Networks", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "144\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "144\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of minnesota minneapolis mn", "city": "minneapolis", "Name": "rezwan ahmed"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of minnesota minneapolis mn", "city": "minneapolis", "Name": "george karypis"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["R.

We propose two classes of dynamic metrics for assessing temporal evolution patterns of agents in terms of persistency and emergence. For each class of dynamic metrics, we implement it using three different temporal aggregation models ranging from the most commonly used Average Aggregation Model to more the complex models such as the Exponential Aggregation Model. We argue that the problem of measuring temporal patterns can be formulated using Recency and Primacy effect, which is a concept used to characterize human cognitive processes. Experimental results show that the way metrics model Recency--Primacy effect is closely related to their abilities to measure temporal patterns. Furthermore, our results indicate that future network agent activities can be predicted based on history information using dynamic metrics. By conducting multiple experiments, we are also able to find an optimal length of history information that is most relevant to future activities. This optimal length is highly consistent within a dataset and can be used as an intrinsic metric to evaluate a dynamic social network.", "authors": [{"name": "wei wei", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81554471656"}, {"name": "kathleen m carley", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100462452"}], "title": "Measuring Temporal Patterns in Dynamic Social Networks", "citations": [{"Name": "Wei Wei ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kenneth Joseph ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Huan Liu ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kathleen M.

Although the existing metrics used to quantify the quality of a community work well in general, under some circumstances, they fail at correctly capturing such notion. The main reason is that these metrics consider the internal community edges as a set, but ignore how these actually connect the vertices of the community. We propose the Weighted Community Clustering (WCC), which is a new community metric that takes the triangle instead of the edge as the minimal structural motif indicating the presence of a strong relation in a graph. We theoretically analyseWCCin depth and formally prove, by means of a set of properties, that the maximization ofWCCguarantees communities with cohesion and structure. In addition, we proposeScalable Community Detection (SCD), a community detection algorithm based onWCC, which is designed to be fast and scalable on SMP machines, showing experimentally thatWCCcorrectly captures the concept of community in social networks using real datasets. Finally, using ground-truth data, we show thatSCDprovides better quality than the best disjoint community detection algorithms of the state of the art while performing faster.", "authors": [{"name": "arnau prat-perez", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384598092"}, {"name": "david dominguez-sal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384621856"}, {"name": "josep-m brunat", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100123620"}, {"name": "josep-lluis larriba-pey", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452601041"}], "title": "Put Three and Three Together: Triangle-Driven Community Detection", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "294\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "63\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "294\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Aruba", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "dama-upc universitat politecnica de catalunya barcelona spain", "city": "barcelona", "Name": "arnau prat-perez"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "josep-m brunat", "city": null, "Name": "david dominguez-sal"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "josep-lluis larriba-pey", "city": null, "Name": "departament matematica aplicada ii universitat politecnica de catalunya barcelona spain"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "david dominguez-sal", "city": null, "Name": "dama-upc universitat politecnica de catalunya barcelona spain"}]}, "Article No.: 23": {"references": ["Yasemin Altun, Ioannis Tsochantaridis, and Thomas Hofmann. 2003.

In this article, we exploit the relations among different modalities in a multimedia database and present a framework for general multimodal data mining problem where image annotation and image retrieval are considered as the special cases. Specifically, the multimodal data mining problem can be formulated as a structured prediction problem where we learn the mapping from an input to the structured and interdependent output variables. In addition, in order to reduce the demanding computation, we propose a new max margin structure learning approach called Enhanced Max Margin Learning (EMML) framework, which is much more efficient with a much faster convergence rate than the existing max margin learning methods, as verified through empirical evaluations. Furthermore, we apply EMML framework to develop an effective and efficient solution to the multimodal data mining problem that is highly scalable in the sense that the query response time is independent of the database scale. The EMML framework allows an efficient multimodal data mining query in a very large scale multimedia database, and excels many existing multimodal data mining methods in the literature that do not scale up at all. The performance comparison with a state-of-the-art multimodal data mining method is reported for the real-world image databases.", "authors": [{"name": "zhen guo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100085033"}, {"name": "zhongfei mark zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451593853"}, {"name": "eric p xing", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81407592503"}, {"name": "christos faloutsos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100373169"}], "title": "Multimodal Data Mining in a Multimedia Database Based on Structured Max Margin Learning", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "90\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "56\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "90\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "suny binghamton ny", "city": null, "Name": "zhen guo"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "suny binghamton ny", "city": null, "Name": "zhongfei mark zhang"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa", "city": "pittsburgh", "Name": "eric p xing"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa", "city": "pittsburgh", "Name": "christos faloutsos"}]}, "Article No.: 24": {"references": ["Solomon Aronson, Cornelius M.

Unfortunately, there is little empirical evidence that vital sign management, as currently practiced, is correlated with patient outcomes. We seek to validate or repudiate current clinical practice and determine whether or not clinician evaluation of surgical vital signs correlate with outcomes. Using a database of over 90,000 cases, we attempt to determine whether those cases that anesthesiologists would subjectively decide are \u201clow quality\u201d are more likely to result in negative outcomes. The problem reduces to one of multi-dimensional time-series classification. Our approach is to have a set of expert anesthesiologists independently label a small number of training cases, from which we build classifiers and label all 90,000 cases. We then use the labeling to search for correlation with outcomes and compare the prevalence of important 30-day outcomes between providers.To mimic the providers\u2019 quality labels, we consider several standard classification methods, such as dynamic time warping in conjunction with a kNN classifier, as well as complexity invariant distance, and a regression based upon the feature extraction methods outlined by Mao et al. 2012 (using features such as time-series mean, standard deviation, skew, etc.). We also propose a new feature selection mechanism that learns a hidden Markov model to segment the time series; the fraction of time that each series spends in each state is used to label the series using a regression-based classifier. In the end, we obtain strong, empirical evidence that current best practice is correlated with reduced negative patient outcomes. We also learn that all of the experts were able to significantly separate cases by outcome, with higher prevalence of negative 30-day outcomes in the cases labeled as \u201clow quality\u201d for almost all of the outcomes investigated.", "authors": [{"name": "risa b myers", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81472642035"}, {"name": "john c frenzel md", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658983836"}, {"name": "joseph r ruiz md", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658984024"}, {"name": "christopher m jermaine", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100586871"}], "title": "Do Anesthesiologists Know What They Are Doing?

An important part of this analysis is to determine the key patterns of flow in the underlying network. Almost all the work in this area has focused on fixed models of the network structure, and edge-based transmission between nodes. In this article, we propose a fully content-centered model of flow analysis in networks, in which the analysis is based on actual content transmissions in the underlying social stream, rather than a static model of transmission on the edges. First, we introduce the problem of influence analysis in the context of information flow in networks. We then propose a novel algorithmInFlowMineto discover the information flow patterns in the network and demonstrate the effectiveness of the discovered information flows using an influence mining application. This application illustrates the flexibility and effectiveness of our information flow model to find topic- or network-specific influencers, or their combinations.

How different is the wiring of Bob\u2019s brain (a left-handed male) and Alice\u2019s brain (a right-handed female), and how is it different? Graph similarity with given node correspondence, i.e., the detection of changes in the connectivity of graphs, arises in numerous settings. In this work, we formally state the axioms and desired properties of the graph similarity functions, and evaluate when state-of-the-art methods fail to detect crucial connectivity changes in graphs. We propose DeltaCon, a principled, intuitive, and scalable algorithm that assesses the similarity between two graphs on the same nodes (e.g., employees of a company, customers of a mobile carrier). In conjunction, we propose DeltaCon-Attr, a related approach that enables attribution of change or dissimilarity to responsible nodes and edges. Experiments on various synthetic and real graphs showcase the advantages of our method over existing similarity measures.

The neglect of such information usually leads to incorrect discovered models, especially when activities have decomposable cyclic dependencies. To address this problem, the recorded workflow relevant data and decision tree learning technique are utilized to classify cases into case clusters. Each case cluster contains causality and concurrency activity dependencies only. Then, a set of activity ordering relations are derived based on case clusters. And a synchronization-core-based process model is discovered from the ordering relations and composite cases. Finally, the discovered model is transformed to a BPMN model. The proposed approach is validated with a medical treatment process and an open event log.

While observational data can be useful, it often only hints at the actual underlying process that governs interactions and attributes. For example, an email communication network provides insight into its users and their relationships, but is not the same as the \u201creal\u201d underlying social network. In this article, we introduce the problem ofgraph identification, i.e., discovering the latent graph structure underlying an observed network. We cast the problem as a probabilistic inference task, in which we must infer the nodes, edges, and node labels of a hidden graph, based on evidence. This entails solving several canonical problems in network analysis:entity resolution(determining when two observations correspond to the same entity),link prediction(inferring the existence of links), andnode labeling(inferring hidden attributes). While each of these subproblems has been well studied in isolation, here we consider them as a single, collective task. We present a simple, yet novel, approach to address all three subproblems simultaneously. Our approach, which we refer to asC3, consists of a collection of Coupled Collective Classifiers that are applied iteratively to propagate inferred information among the subproblems. We consider variants ofC3using different learning and inference techniques and empirically demonstrate thatC3is superior, both in terms of predictive accuracy and running time, to state-of-the-art probabilistic approaches on four real problems.", "authors": [{"name": "galileo mark namata", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81336491690"}, {"name": "ben london", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82658911157"}, {"name": "lise getoor", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100205081"}], "title": "Collective Graph Identification", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "124\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "47\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "124\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland college park md", "city": null, "Name": "galileo mark namata"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland college park md", "city": null, "Name": "ben london"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland college park", "city": null, "Name": "lise getoor"}]}, "Article No.: 32": {"references": ["Amir Beck , Marc Teboulle, A Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm for Linear Inverse Problems, SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences, v.2 n.1, p.183-202, January 2009[doi>10.1137/080716542]\n", "Jacob Bien, Noah Simon, Robert Tibshirani, and others. 2015.

In many applications, fitting a regression model with only linear effects may not be sufficient for predictive or explanatory purposes. One strategy that has recently received increasing attention in statistics is to include feature interactions to capture the nonlinearity in the regression model. Such model has been applied successfully in many biomedical applications. One major challenge in the use of such model is that the data dimensionality is significantly higher than the original data, resulting in the small sample size large dimension problem. Recently, weak hierarchical Lasso, a sparse interaction regression model, is proposed that produces a sparse and hierarchical structured estimator by exploiting the Lasso penalty and a set of hierarchical constraints. However, the hierarchical constraints make it a non-convex problem and the existing method finds the solution to its convex relaxation, which needs additional conditions to guarantee the hierarchical structure. In this article, we propose to directly solve the non-convex weak hierarchical Lasso by making use of the General Iterative Shrinkage and Thresholding (GIST) optimization framework, which has been shown to be efficient for solving non-convex sparse formulations. The key step in GIST is to compute a sequence of proximal operators. One of our key technical contributions is to show that the proximal operator associated with the non-convex weak hierarchical Lasso admits a closed-form solution. However, a naive approach for solving each subproblem of the proximal operator leads to a quadratic time complexity, which is not desirable for large-size problems. We have conducted extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets. Results show that our proposed algorithm is much more efficient and effective than its convex relaxation. To this end, we further develop an efficient algorithm for computing the subproblems with a linearithmic time complexity. In addition, we extend the technique to perform the optimization-based hierarchical testing of pairwise interactions for binary classification problems, which is essentially the proximal operator associated with weak hierarchical Lasso. Simulation studies show that the non-convex hierarchical testing framework outperforms the convex relaxation when a hierarchical structure exists between main effects and interactions.", "authors": [{"name": "yashu liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658632200"}, {"name": "jie wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82658838957"}, {"name": "jieping ye", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100042425"}], "title": "An Efficient Algorithm For Weak Hierarchical Lasso", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "61\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "28\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "61\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Grenada", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "arizona state university tempe az", "city": "tempe", "Name": "yashu liu"}, {"country": "Grenada", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "arizona state university tempe az", "city": "tempe", "Name": "jie wang"}, {"country": "Grenada", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "arizona state university tempe az", "city": "tempe", "Name": "jieping ye"}]}, "Article No.: 29": {"references": ["Gediminas Adomavicius , Alexander Tuzhilin, Toward the Next Generation of Recommender Systems: A Survey of the State-of-the-Art and Possible Extensions, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, v.17 n.6, p.734-749, June 2005[doi>10.1109/TKDE.2005.99]\n", "Chia-Hui Chang , Mohammed Kayed , Moheb Ramzy Girgis , Khaled F.

In specific, we propose a bootstrapping approach for the extraction of product adopters from review text and categorize them into a number of different demographic categories. The aggregated demographic information of many product adopters can be used to characterize both products and users in the form of distributions over different demographic categories. We further propose a graph-based method to iteratively update user- and product-related distributions more reliably in a heterogeneous user--product graph and incorporate them as features into the matrix factorization approach for product recommendation.

Intuitively, the GOF score measures the probability to stay in the neighborhood of a certain object. It is directly proportional to the density and inversely proportional to the variation of the density. We derive formal properties under which the GOF definition unifies the statistical outlier definition and show that the unification holds for some standard distributions, while the GOF is able to capture tails in the presence of different distributions even if their densities sensibly differ. Moreover, we provide a probabilistic interpretation of the GOF score, by means of the notion of density of the data density. Experimental results confirm that there are scenarios in which the novel definition can be profitably employed.

In this article, we present Adaptive Model Rules (AMRules), the first stream rule learning algorithm for regression problems. In AMRules, the antecedent of a rule is a conjunction of conditions on the attribute values, and the consequent is a linear combination of the attributes. In order to maintain a regression model compatible with the most recent state of the process generating data, each rule uses a Page-Hinkley test to detect changes in this process and react to changes by pruning the rule set. Online learning might be strongly affected by outliers. AMRules is also equipped with outliers detection mechanisms to avoid model adaption using anomalous examples. In the experimental section, we report the results of AMRules on benchmark regression problems, and compare the performance of our system with other streaming regression algorithms.", "authors": [{"name": "joao duarte", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658981635"}, {"name": "joao gama", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100028845"}, {"name": "albert bifet", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367594869"}], "title": "Adaptive Model Rules From High-Speed Data Streams", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "130\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "62\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "130\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Portugal", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "liaad-inesc tec porto portugal", "city": "porto", "Name": "joao duarte"}, {"country": "Portugal", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "liaad-inesc tec faculty of economics university of porto porto portugal", "city": "porto", "Name": "joao gama"}]}, "Article No.: 21": {"references": ["Lars Backstrom , Dan Huttenlocher , Jon Kleinberg , Xiangyang Lan, Group formation in large social networks: membership, growth, and evolution, Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining, August 20-23, 2006, Philadelphia, PA, USA[doi>10.1145/1150402.1150412]\n", "Zoheb Borbora, Jaideep Srivastava, Kuo-Wei Hsu, and Dmitri Williams. 2011.

In the domain of telecommunications and video games, churners represent a loss of revenue as a user leaving indicates that they will no longer pay for the service. In the context of online community platforms (e.g., community message boards, social networking sites, question--answering systems, etc.), the churning of a user can represent different kinds of loss: of social capital, of expertise, or of a vibrant individual who is a mediator for interaction and communication. Detecting which users are likely to churn from online communities, therefore, enables community managers to offer incentives to entice those users back; as retention is less expensive than re-signing users up. In this article, we tackle the task of detecting churners on four online community platforms by mining user development signals. These signals explain how users have evolved along different dimensions (i.e., social and lexical) relative to their prior behaviour and the community in which they have interacted. We present a linear model, based upon elastic-net regularisation, that uses extracted features from the signals to detect churners. Our evaluation of this model against several state of the art baselines, including our own prior work, empirically demonstrates the superior performance that this approach achieves for several experimental settings. This article presents a novel approach to churn prediction that takes a different route from existing approaches that are based on measuring static social network properties of users (e.g., centrality, in-degree, etc.).", "authors": [{"name": "matthew rowe", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436597328"}], "title": "Mining User Development Signals for Online Community Churner Detection", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "139\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "69\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "139\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United Kingdom", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "school of computing and communications lancaster university uk", "city": "lancaster", "Name": "matthew rowe"}]}}, "date": {"month": "February", "year": "2016"}}}, "Volume5": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Article No.: 22": {"references": ["Jacob Abernethy , Francis Bach , Theodoros Evgeniou , Jean-Philippe Vert, A New Approach to Collaborative Filtering: Operator Estimation with Spectral Regularization, The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 10, p.803-826, 12/1/2009\n", "Ando, R.

Our approach is based on a linear multitask learning formulation, in which the sparse and low-rank patterns are induced by a cardinality regularization term and a low-rank constraint, respectively. This formulation is nonconvex; we convert it into its convex surrogate, which can be routinely solved via semidefinite programming for small-size problems. We propose employing the general projected gradient scheme to efficiently solve such a convex surrogate; however, in the optimization formulation, the objective function is nondifferentiable and the feasible domain is nontrivial. We present the procedures for computing the projected gradient and ensuring the global convergence of the projected gradient scheme. The computation of the projected gradient involves a constrained optimization problem; we show that the optimal solution to such a problem can be obtained via solving an unconstrained optimization subproblem and a Euclidean projection subproblem. We also present two projected gradient algorithms and analyze their rates of convergence in detail. In addition, we illustrate the use of the presented projected gradient algorithms for the proposed multitask learning formulation using the least squares loss. Experimental results on a collection of real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multitask learning formulation and the efficiency of the proposed projected gradient algorithms.", "authors": [{"name": "jianhui chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81343489892"}, {"name": "ji liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81466644670"}, {"name": "jieping ye", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100042425"}], "title": "Learning Incoherent Sparse and Low-Rank Patterns from Multiple Tasks", "citations": [{"Name": "Lei Han ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yu Zhang ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Guojie Song ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kunqing Xie", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Haiqin Yang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michael R.

Topics naturally evolve with multiple timescales. For example, some words may be used consistently over one hundred years, while other words emerge and disappear over periods of a few days. Thus, in the proposed model, current topic-specific distributions over words are assumed to be generated based on the multiscale word distributions of the previous epoch. Considering both the long- and short-timescale dependency yields a more robust model. We derive efficient online inference procedures based on a stochastic EM algorithm, in which the model is sequentially updated using newly obtained data; this means that past data are not required to make the inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of predictive performance and computational efficiency by examining collections of real documents with timestamps.", "authors": [{"name": "tomoharu iwata", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329489682"}, {"name": "takeshi yamada", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350597309"}, {"name": "yasushi sakurai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452606482"}, {"name": "naonori ueda", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100364194"}], "title": "Sequential Modeling of Topic Dynamics with Multiple Timescales", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "35\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "523\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ntt communication science laboratories", "city": null, "Name": "tomoharu iwata"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ntt science and core technology laboratory group", "city": null, "Name": "takeshi yamada"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ntt communication science laboratories", "city": null, "Name": "yasushi sakurai"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ntt communication science laboratories", "city": null, "Name": "naonori ueda"}]}, "Article No.: 23": {"references": ["Bertsekas, D.

However, most of the existing training methods are designed by assuming that data can be stored in the computer memory. These methods cannot be easily applied to data larger than the memory capacity due to the random access to the disk. We propose and analyze a block minimization framework for data larger than the memory size. At each step a block of data is loaded from the disk and handled by certain learning methods. We investigate two implementations of the proposed framework for primal and dual SVMs, respectively. Because data cannot fit in memory, many design considerations are very different from those for traditional algorithms. We discuss and compare with existing approaches that are able to handle data larger than memory. Experiments using data sets 20 times larger than the memory demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "authors": [{"name": "hsiang-fu yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81466645094"}, {"name": "cho-jui hsieh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81365592567"}, {"name": "kai-wei chang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81365593715"}, {"name": "chih-jen lin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384612017"}], "title": "Large Linear Classification When Data Cannot Fit in Memory", "citations": [{"Name": "Dongyeop Kang ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Woosang Lim ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kijung Shin ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lee Sael ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "U.

Previous topic model approaches, such as probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), have shown impressive success in discovering low-rank hidden structures for modeling text documents. These approaches, however do not take into account the manifold structure of the data, which is generally informative for nonlinear dimensionality reduction mapping. More recent topic model approaches, Laplacian PLSI (LapPLSI) and Locally-consistent Topic Model (LTM), have incorporated the local manifold structure into topic models and have shown resulting benefits. But they fall short of achieving full discriminating power of manifold learning as they only enhance the proximity between the low-rank representations of neighboring pairs without any consideration for non-neighboring pairs. In this article, we propose a new approach, Discriminative Topic Model (DTM), which separates non-neighboring pairs from each other in addition to bringing neighboring pairs closer together, thereby preserving the global manifold structure as well as improving local consistency. We also present a novel model-fitting algorithm based on the generalized EM algorithm and the concept of Pareto improvement. We empirically demonstrate the success of DTM in terms of unsupervised clustering and semisupervised classification accuracies on text corpora and robustness to parameters compared to state-of-the-art techniques.", "authors": [{"name": "seungil huh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81466643143"}, {"name": "stephen e fienberg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81337489188"}], "title": "Discriminative Topic Modeling Based on Manifold Learning", "citations": [{"Name": "Tuan M.

Entire sectors, from Web users to scientists and intelligence analysts, are increasingly struggling to keep up with the larger and larger amounts of content published every day. With this much data, it is often easy to miss the big picture.In this article, we investigate methods for automatically connecting the dots---providing a structured, easy way to navigate within a new topic and discover hidden connections. We focus on the news domain: given two news articles, our system automatically finds a coherent chain linking them together. For example, it can recover the chain of events starting with the decline of home prices (January 2007), and ending with the health care debate (2009).We formalize the characteristics of a good chain and provide a fast search-driven algorithm to connect two fixed endpoints. We incorporate user feedback into our framework, allowing the stories to be refined and personalized. We also provide a method to handle partially-specified endpoints, for users who do not know both ends of a story. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm over real news data. Our user studies demonstrate that the objective we propose captures the users\u2019 intuitive notion of coherence, and that our algorithm effectively helps users understand the news.", "authors": [{"name": "dafna shahaf", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442599568"}, {"name": "carlos guestrin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100629945"}], "title": "Connecting Two (or Less) Dots: Discovering Structure in News Articles", "citations": [{"Name": "Thomas B\u00f6gel ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michael Gertz", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tong Gao ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jessica R.

While it is often possible to directly observe when nodes become infected with a virus or publish the information, observing individual transmissions (who infects whom, or who influences whom) is typically very difficult. Furthermore, in many applications, the underlying network over which the diffusions and propagations spread is actually unobserved. We tackle these challenges by developing a method for tracing paths of diffusion and influence through networks and inferring the networks over which contagions propagate. Given the times when nodes adopt pieces of information or become infected, we identify the optimal network that best explains the observed infection times. Since the optimization problem is NP-hard to solve exactly, we develop an efficient approximation algorithm that scales to large datasets and finds provably near-optimal networks.We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by tracing information diffusion in a set of 170 million blogs and news articles over a one year period to infer how information flows through the online media space. We find that the diffusion network of news for the top 1,000 media sites and blogs tends to have a core-periphery structure with a small set of core media sites that diffuse information to the rest of the Web. These sites tend to have stable circles of influence with more general news media sites acting as connectors between them.", "authors": [{"name": "manuel gomez-rodriguez", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81466648390"}, {"name": "jure leskovec", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367595814"}, {"name": "andreas krause", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100460663"}], "title": "Inferring Networks of Diffusion and Influence", "citations": [{"Name": "Senzhang Wang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xia Hu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Philip S.

A procedure for discovering members of such a community is devised. As a case study, we focus on Yahoo! Answers, a large and diverse online question-answering service. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose a method for automatic identification of authoritative actors in Yahoo! Answers. To this end, we estimate and then model the authority scores of participants as a mixture of gamma distributions. The number of components in the mixture is determined using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), while the parameters of each component are estimated using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This method allows us to automatically discriminate between authoritative and nonauthoritative users. Second, we represent the forum environment as a type of transactional data such that each transaction summarizes the interaction of an asker with a specific set of authoritative users. Then, to group askers on the basis of their interactions with authoritative users, we propose a parameter-free transaction data clustering algorithm which is based on a novel criterion function. The identified clusters correspond to the communities that we aim to discover. To evaluate the suitability of our clustering algorithm, we conduct a series of experiments on both synthetic data and public real-life data. Finally, we put our approach to work using data from Yahoo!

Previously, Web user profiling was often undertaken by creating a list of keywords for the user, which is (sometimes even highly) insufficient for main applications. This article formalizes the profiling problem as several subtasks: profile extraction, profile integration, and user interest discovery. We propose a combination approach to deal with the profiling tasks. Specifically, we employ a classification model to identify relevant documents for a user from the Web and propose a Tree-Structured Conditional Random Fields (TCRF) to extract the profile information from the identified documents; we propose a unified probabilistic model to deal with the name ambiguity problem (several users with the same name) when integrating the profile information extracted from different sources; finally, we use a probabilistic topic model to model the extracted user profiles, and construct the user interest model. Experimental results on an online system show that the combination approach to different profiling tasks clearly outperforms several baseline methods. The extracted profiles have been applied to expert finding, an important application on the Web. Experiments show that the accuracy of expert finding can be improved (ranging from +6&percnt; to +26&percnt; in terms of MAP) by taking advantage of the profiles.", "authors": [{"name": "jie tang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350588685"}, {"name": "limin yao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350600057"}, {"name": "duo zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81363603541"}, {"name": "jing zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81408596200"}], "title": "A Combination Approach to Web User Profiling", "citations": [{"Name": "Mohammed Nazim Uddin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Trong Hai Duong ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Visal Sean ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Geun-Sik Jo", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Construction of semantic user profile for personalized web search", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jie Tang", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Suman Kundu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "C.

Our goal in this article is to monitor multiple numerical streams and determine which pairs are correlated with lags, as well as the value of each such lag. Lag correlations and anticorrelations are frequent and very interesting in practice. For example, a decrease in interest rates typically precedes an increase in house sales by a few months; higher amounts of fluoride in drinking water may lead to fewer dental cavities some years later. Other lag settings include network analysis, sensor monitoring, financial data analysis, and tracking of moving objects. Such data streams are often correlated or anticorrelated, but with unknown lag.We propose BRAID, a method of detecting lag correlations among data streams. BRAID can handle data streams of semi-infinite length incrementally, quickly, and with small resource consumption. However, BRAID requires space and time quadratic on a number of streamsk. We also propose ThinBRAID, which is even faster than BRAID, requiringO(k) space and time per time tick. Our theoretical analysis shows that BRAID/ThinBRAID can estimate lag correlations with little or, often, withnoerror. Our experiments on real and realistic data show that BRAID and ThinBRAID detect the correct lag perfectly most of the time (the largest relative error was about 1&percnt;), while they are significantly faster (up to 40,000 times) than the na\u00efve implementation.", "authors": [{"name": "yasushi sakurai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452606482"}, {"name": "christos faloutsos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100373169"}, {"name": "spiros papadimitriou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100631405"}], "title": "Fast Discovery of Group Lag Correlations in Streams", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "43\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "882\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ntt communication science laboratories", "city": null, "Name": "yasushi sakurai"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university", "city": null, "Name": "christos faloutsos"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm tj watson research center", "city": null, "Name": "spiros papadimitriou"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Ahmad, O.2006.

Not much attention has been given to the privacy risk of users posed by their daily information-sharing activities.In this article, we approach the privacy issues raised in online social networks from the individual users\u2019 viewpoint: we propose a framework to compute the privacy score of a user. This score indicates the user\u2019s potential risk caused by his or her participation in the network. Our definition of privacy score satisfies the following intuitive properties: the more sensitive information a user discloses, the higher his or her privacy risk. Also, the more visible the disclosed information becomes in the network, the higher the privacy risk. We develop mathematical models to estimate bothsensitivityandvisibilityof the information. We apply our methods to synthetic and real-world data and demonstrate their efficacy and practical utility.", "authors": [{"name": "kun liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452593047"}, {"name": "evimaria terzi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100469792"}], "title": "A Framework for Computing the Privacy Scores of Users in Online Social Networks", "citations": [{"Name": "David Pergament ", "Country": "lebanon", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Armen Aghasaryan ", "Country": "lebanon", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jean-Gabriel Ganascia ", "Country": "lebanon", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "St\u00e9phane Betg\u00e9-Brezetz", "Country": "lebanon", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ahmed A.

The social annotations contributed by thousands of users can potentially be used to infer categorical knowledge, classify documents, or recommend new relevant information. Traditional text inference methods do not make the best use of social annotation, since they do not take into account variations in individual users\u2019 perspectives and vocabulary. In a previous work, we introduced a simple probabilistic model that takes the interests of individual annotators into account in order to find hidden topics of annotated resources. Unfortunately, that approach had one major shortcoming: the number of topics and interests must be specified a priori. To address this drawback, we extend the model to a fully Bayesian framework, which offers a way to automatically estimate these numbers. In particular, the model allows the number of interests and topics to change as suggested by the structure of the data. We evaluate the proposed model in detail on the synthetic and real-world data by comparing its performance to Latent Dirichlet Allocation on the topic extraction task. For the latter evaluation, we apply the model to infer topics of Web resources from social annotations obtained fromDeliciousin order to discover new resources similar to a specified one. Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed model is a promising method for exploiting social knowledge contained in user-generated annotations.", "authors": [{"name": "anon plangprasopchok", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418595576"}, {"name": "kristina lerman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100590402"}], "title": "Modeling Social Annotation: A Bayesian Approach", "citations": [{"Name": "Jeon-Hyung Kang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kristina Lerman ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lise Getoor", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "26\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "544\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "kristina lerman", "city": null, "Name": "anon plangprasopchok"}]}}, "date": {"month": "December", "year": "2010"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 16": {"references": ["Charu C.

Privacy models/definitions using group based anonymization includesk-anonymity,l-diversity, andt-closeness, to name a few. The goal of this article is to raise a fundamental issue regarding the privacy exposure of the approaches using group based anonymization. This has been overlooked in the past. The group based anonymization approach by bucketization basically hides each individual record behind a group to preserve data privacy. If not properly anonymized, patterns can actually be derived from the published data and be used by an adversary to breach individual privacy. For example, from the medical records released, if patterns such as that people from certain countries rarely suffer from some disease can be derived, then the information can be used to imply linkage of other people in an anonymized group with this disease with higher likelihood. We call the derived patterns from the published data the foreground knowledge. This is in contrast to the background knowledge that the adversary may obtain from other channels, as studied in some previous work. Finally, our experimental results show such an attack is realistic in the privacy benchmark dataset under the traditional group based anonymization approach.", "authors": [{"name": "raymond chi-wing wong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81406592097"}, {"name": "ada wai-chee fu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451592510"}, {"name": "ke wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350574174"}, {"name": "philip s yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350576309"}, {"name": "jian pei", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100323054"}], "title": "Can the Utility of Anonymized Data be Used for Privacy Breaches?", "citations": [{"Name": "Xiaojian Zhang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiaofeng Meng", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Discovering top-k patterns with differential privacy-an accurate approach", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rui Chen ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Benjamin C.M.

Many analytic techniques for networks require finding low-cost paths, but exact methods for search become prohibitive for large networks, and data sets are steadily increasing in size. Short paths can be found efficiently by utilizing an index of network structure, which estimates network distances and enables rapid discovery of short paths. Through experiments on synthetic networks, we demonstrate that one such novel network structure index based on the shortest-path tree outperforms other previously proposed indices. We also show that it generalizes across arbitrarily weighted networks of various structures and densities, provides accurate estimates of distance, and has efficient time and space complexity. We present results on real data sets for several applications, including navigation, diameter estimation, centrality computation, and clustering---all made efficient by virtue of the network structure index.", "authors": [{"name": "marc maier", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81317489087"}, {"name": "matthew rattigan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100417672"}, {"name": "david jensen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100640362"}], "title": "Indexing Network Structure with Shortest-Path Trees", "citations": [{"Name": "Abdullah Gani ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Aisha Siddiqa ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shahaboddin Shamshirband ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fariza Hanum", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "25\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "670\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of massachusetts amherst", "city": null, "Name": "marc maier"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of massachusetts amherst", "city": null, "Name": "matthew rattigan"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of massachusetts amherst", "city": null, "Name": "david jensen"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Blei, D.

Current document clustering methods usually represent the given collection of documents as a document-term matrix and then conduct the clustering process. Although many of these clustering methods can group the documents effectively, it is still hard for people to capture the meaning of the documents since there is no satisfactory interpretation for each document cluster. A straightforward solution is to first cluster the documents and then summarize each document cluster using summarization methods. However, most of the current summarization methods are solely based on the sentence-term matrix and ignore the context dependence of the sentences. As a result, the generated summaries lack guidance from the document clusters. In this article, we propose a new language model to simultaneously cluster and summarize documents by making use of both the document-term and sentence-term matrices. By utilizing the mutual influence of document clustering and summarization, our method makes; (1) a better document clustering method with more meaningful interpretation; and (2) an effective document summarization method with guidance from document clustering. Experimental results on various document datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed method and the high interpretability of the generated summaries.", "authors": [{"name": "dingding wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81363591802"}, {"name": "shenghuo zhu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100413890"}, {"name": "tao li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100475528"}, {"name": "yun chi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350577988"}, {"name": "yihong gong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100009870"}], "title": "Integrating Document Clustering and Multidocument Summarization", "citations": [{"Name": "Besnik Fetahu ", "Country": "brazil", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bernardo Pereira Nunes ", "Country": "brazil", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Stefan Dietze", "Country": "brazil", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Besnik Fetahu ", "Country": "denmark", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bernardo Pereira Nunes ", "Country": "denmark", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Stefan Dietze", "Country": "denmark", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rasim M.

Community structure represents the latent social context of user actions. It has important applications such as search and recommendation. The problem is particularly useful in the enterprise domain, where extracting emergent community structure on enterprise social media can help in forming new collaborative teams, in expertise discovery, and in the long term reorganization of enterprises based on collaboration patterns. There are several unique challenges: (a) In social media, the context of user actions is constantly changing and coevolving; hence the social context contains time-evolving multidimensional relations. (b) The social context is determined by the available system features and is unique in each social media platform; hence the analysis of such data needs to flexibly incorporate various system features. In this article we propose MetaFac (MetaGraph Factorization), a framework that extracts community structures from dynamic, multidimensional social contexts and interactions. Our work has three key contributions: (1) metagraph, a novel relational hypergraph representation for modeling multirelational and multidimensional social data; (2) an efficient multirelational factorization method for community extraction on a given metagraph; (3) an online method to handle time-varying relations through incremental metagraph factorization. Extensive experiments on real-world social data collected from an enterprise and the public Digg social media Web site suggest that our technique is scalable and is able to extract meaningful communities from social media contexts. We illustrate the usefulness of our framework through two prediction tasks: (1) in the enterprise dataset, the task is to predict users\u2019 future interests on tag usage, and (2) in the Digg dataset, the task is to predict users\u2019 future interests in voting and commenting on Digg stories. Our prediction significantly outperforms baseline methods (including aspect model and tensor analysis), indicating the promising direction of using metagraphs for handling time-varying social relational contexts.", "authors": [{"name": "yu-ru lin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329490164"}, {"name": "jimeng sun", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81455605573"}, {"name": "hari sundaram", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100245977"}, {"name": "aisling kelliher", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319494744"}, {"name": "paul castro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100104463"}, {"name": "ravi konuru", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436593342"}], "title": "Community Discovery via Metagraph Factorization", "citations": [{"Name": "Joyce C.

How are they connected? What are the central nodes and the outliers? In this article we define the Radius plot of a graph and show how it can answer these questions. However, computing the Radius plot is prohibitively expensive for graphs reaching the planetary scale.There are two major contributions in this article: (a) We propose HADI (HAdoop DIameter and radii estimator), a carefully designed and fine-tuned algorithm to compute the radii and the diameter of massive graphs, that runs on the top of theHadoop/MapReducesystem, with excellent scale-up on the number of available machines (b) We run HADI on several real world datasets including YahooWeb (6B edges, 1/8 of a Terabyte), one of the largest public graphs ever analyzed.Thanks to HADI, we report fascinating patterns on large networks, like the surprisingly small effective diameter, the multimodal/bimodal shape of the Radius plot, and its palindrome motion over time.", "authors": [{"name": "u kang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100492259"}, {"name": "charalampos e tsourakakis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384619692"}, {"name": "ana paula appel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329487440"}, {"name": "christos faloutsos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100373169"}, {"name": "jure leskovec", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367595814"}], "title": "HADI: Mining Radii of Large Graphs", "citations": [{"Name": "Leman Akoglu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Duen Horng Chau ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "U.

In this article, we consider the problem of temporal link prediction: Given link data for times 1 throughT, can we predict the links at timeT+ 1? If our data has underlying periodic structure, can we predict out even further in time, i.e., links at timeT+ 2,T+ 3, etc.? In this article, we consider bipartite graphs that evolve over time and consider matrix- and tensor-based methods for predicting future links. We present a weight-based method for collapsing multiyear data into a single matrix. We show how the well-known Katz method for link prediction can be extended to bipartite graphs and, moreover, approximated in a scalable way using a truncated singular value decomposition. Using a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC tensor decomposition of the data, we illustrate the usefulness of exploiting the natural three-dimensional structure of temporal link data. Through several numerical experiments, we demonstrate that both matrix- and tensor-based techniques are effective for temporal link prediction despite the inherent difficulty of the problem. Additionally, we show that tensor-based techniques are particularly effective for temporal data with varying periodic patterns.", "authors": [{"name": "daniel m dunlavy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100093244"}, {"name": "tamara g kolda", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100225962"}, {"name": "evrim acar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81318497714"}], "title": "Temporal Link Prediction Using Matrix and Tensor Factorizations", "citations": [{"Name": "Lina Yao ", "Country": "chile", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Quan Z.

Graph vertices represent entities, and graph edges represent their relationships or interactions. In many large graphs, there is usually one or more attributes associated with every graph vertex to describe its properties. In many application domains, graph clustering techniques are very useful for detecting densely connected groups in a large graph as well as for understanding and visualizing a large graph. The goal of graph clustering is to partition vertices in a large graph into different clusters based on various criteria such as vertex connectivity or neighborhood similarity. Many existing graph clustering methods mainly focus on the topological structure for clustering, but largely ignore the vertex properties, which are often heterogenous. In this article, we propose a novel graph clustering algorithm,SA-Cluster, which achieves a good balance between structural and attribute similarities through a unified distance measure. Our method partitions a large graph associated with attributes intokclusters so that each cluster contains a densely connected subgraph with homogeneous attribute values. An effective method is proposed to automatically learn the degree of contributions of structural similarity and attribute similarity. Theoretical analysis is provided to show that SA-Cluster is converging quickly through iterative cluster refinement. Some optimization techniques on matrix computation are proposed to further improve the efficiency of SA-Cluster on large graphs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SA-Cluster through comparisons with the state-of-the-art graph clustering and summarization methods.", "authors": [{"name": "hong cheng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351596071"}, {"name": "yang zhou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81438595405"}, {"name": "jeffrey xu yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81447600785"}], "title": "Clustering Large Attributed Graphs: A Balance between Structural and Attribute Similarities", "citations": [{"Name": "Andreas Papadopoulos ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "George Pallis ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marios D.

Many practical applications involving the use of large matrices focus on low-rank approximations. By reducing the rank or dimensionality of the data, we reduce the complexity of analyzing the data. The singular value decomposition is the most popular low-rank matrix approximation. However, due to its expensive computational requirements, it has often been considered intractable for practical applications involving massive data. Recent developments have tried to address this problem, with several methods proposed to approximate the decomposition with better asymptotic runtime. We present an empirical study of these techniques on a variety of dense and sparse datasets. We find that a sampling approach of Drineas, Kannan and Mahoney is often, but not always, the best performing method. This method gives solutions with high accuracy much faster than classical SVD algorithms, on large sparse datasets in particular. Other modern methods, such as a recent algorithm by Rokhlin and Tygert, also offer savings compared to classical SVD algorithms. The older sampling methods of Achlioptas and McSherry are shown to sometimes take longer than classical SVD.", "authors": [{"name": "aditya krishna menon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81467651321"}, {"name": "charles elkan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339498029"}], "title": "Fast Algorithms for Approximating the Singular Value Decomposition", "citations": [{"Name": "Erik Cambria ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jie Fu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Federica Bisio ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Soujanya Poria", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "155\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "20\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "1287\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Mali", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california san diego", "city": "san", "Name": "aditya krishna menon"}, {"country": "Mali", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california san diego", "city": "san", "Name": "charles elkan"}]}, "Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Abu-Khzam, F., Samatova, N., Ostrouchov, G., Langston, M., and Geist, A.2002.

The reason is that typical data mining tasks, such as clustering, cannot produce high quality results when applied on high-dimensional and/or large (in terms of cardinality) datasets. Data preprocessing and in particular dimensionality reduction constitute promising tools to deal with this problem. However, most of the existing dimensionality reduction algorithms share also the same disadvantages with data mining algorithms, when applied on large datasets of high dimensionality. In this article, we propose a fast and efficient dimensionality reduction algorithm (FEDRA), which is particularly scalable and therefore suitable for challenging datasets. FEDRA follows the landmark-based paradigm for embedding data objects in a low-dimensional projection space. By means of a theoretical analysis, we prove that FEDRA is efficient, while we demonstrate the achieved quality of results through experiments on datasets of higher cardinality and dimensionality than those employed in the evaluation of competitive algorithms. The obtained results prove that FEDRA manages to retain or ameliorate clustering quality while projecting in less than 10&percnt; of the initial dimensionality. Moreover, our algorithm produces embeddings that enable the faster convergence of clustering algorithms. Therefore, FEDRA emerges as a powerful and generic tool for data pre-processing, which can be integrated in other data mining algorithms, thus enhancing their performance.", "authors": [{"name": "panagis magdalinos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474694444"}, {"name": "christos doulkeridis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100143389"}, {"name": "michalis vazirgiannis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100414295"}], "title": "Enhancing Clustering Quality through Landmark-Based Dimensionality Reduction", "citations": [{"Name": "Maria Camila N.

However, quadratic scalability for the brute force approach of comparing all possible pairs of records necessitates the design of appropriate indexing or blocking techniques. The aim of these techniques is to cheaply remove candidate record pairs that are unlikely to match. We design and evaluate an efficient and highly scalable blocking approach based on suffix arrays. Our suffix grouping technique exploits the ordering used by the index to merge similar blocks at marginal extra cost, resulting in a much higher accuracy while retaining the high scalability of the base suffix array method. Efficiently grouping similar suffixes is carried out with the use of a sliding window technique. We carry out an in-depth analysis of our method and show results from experiments using real and synthetic data, which highlight the importance of using efficient indexing and blocking in real-world applications where datasets contain millions of records. We extend our disk-based methods with the capability to utilise main memory based storage to construct Bloom filters, which we have found to cause significant speedup by reducing the number of costly database queries by up to 70&percnt; in real data. We give practical implementation details and show how Bloom filters can be easily applied to Suffix Array based indexing.", "authors": [{"name": "timothy de vries", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81447593988"}, {"name": "hui ke", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81447600281"}, {"name": "sanjay chawla", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100002847"}, {"name": "peter christen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100259455"}], "title": "Robust Record Linkage Blocking Using Suffix Arrays and Bloom Filters", "citations": [{"Name": "Dinusha Vatsalan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Peter Christen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Vassilios S.

We push the intuition of redundancy further to find an intuitive notion of novelty of an association rule, with respect to other rules. Namely, an irredundant rule is so because its confidence is higher than what the rest of the rules would suggest; then, one can ask: how much higher&quest;We propose to measure such a sort of novelty through theconfidence boostof a rule. Acting as a complement to confidence and support, the confidence boost helps to obtain small and crisp sets of mined association rules and solves the well-known problem that, in certain cases, rules of negative correlation may pass the confidence bound. We analyze the properties of two versions of the notion of confidence boost, one of them a natural generalization of the other. We develop algorithms to filter rules according to their confidence boost, compare the concept to some similar notions in the literature, and describe the results of some experimentation employing the new notions on standard benchmark datasets. We describe an open source association mining tool that embodies one of our variants of confidence boost in such a way that the data mining process does not require the user to select any value for any parameter.", "authors": [{"name": "jose l balcazar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=86158863157"}], "title": "Formal and computational properties of the confidence boost of association rules", "citations": [{"Name": "Jayakrushna Sahoo ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ashok Kumar Das ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "A.

Our algorithm builds on the assumption that prominent actors collaborate on prominent objects, and prominent objects are naturally grouped into prominent clusters or groups (hyperedges in a graph). iHypR makes use of the relationships between actors, objects, and hyperedges to compute a global prominence score for the actors in the network. We do not assume the hyperedges are given in advance. Hyperedges computed by our method can perform as well or even better than \u201ctrue\u201d hyperedges. Our algorithm is customized for networks of collaborations, but it is generally applicable without further tuning. We show, through extensive experimentation with three real-life data sets and multiple external measures of prominence, that our algorithm outperforms existing well-known algorithms. Our work is the first to offer such an extensive evaluation. We show that unlike most existing algorithms, the performance is robust across multiple measures of performance. Further, we give a detailed study of the sensitivity of our algorithm to different data sets and the design choices within the algorithm that a user may wish to change. Our article illustrates the various trade-offs that must be considered in computing prominence in collaborative social networks.", "authors": [{"name": "sibel adali", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100172970"}, {"name": "malik magdon-ismail", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100309641"}, {"name": "xiaohui lu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=86158766157"}], "title": "iHypR: Prominence ranking in networks of collaborations with hyperedges1", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "27\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "164\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Jamaica", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "department of computer science rensselaer polytechnic institute troy ny", "city": "troy", "Name": "sibel adali"}, {"country": "Jamaica", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "department of computer science rensselaer polytechnic institute troy ny", "city": "troy", "Name": "malik magdon-ismail"}, {"country": "Jamaica", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "department of computer science rensselaer polytechnic institute troy ny", "city": "troy", "Name": "xiaohui lu"}]}, "Article No.: 17": {"references": ["Punam Bedi , Harmeet Kaur , Sudeep Marwaha, Trust based recommender system for the semantic web, Proceedings of the 20th international joint conference on Artifical intelligence, p.2677-2682, January 06-12, 2007, Hyderabad, India\n", "Daniel Billsus , Michael J.

However, such social network data often suffer from severe data sparsity and are not able to provide users with enough information. Therefore, trust prediction has emerged as an important topic in social network research. Traditional approaches are primarily based on exploring trust graph topology itself. However, research in sociology and our life experience suggest that people who are in the same social circle often exhibit similar behaviors and tastes. To take advantage of the ancillary information for trust prediction, the challenge then becomes what to transfer and how to transfer. In this article, we address this problem by aggregating heterogeneous social networks and propose a novel joint social networks mining (JSNM) method. Our new joint learning model explores the user-group-level similarity between correlated graphs and simultaneously learns the individual graph structure; therefore, the shared structures and patterns from multiple social networks can be utilized to enhance the prediction tasks. As a result, we not only improve the trust prediction in the target graph but also facilitate other information retrieval tasks in the auxiliary graphs. To optimize the proposed objective function, we use the alternative technique to break down the objective function into several manageable subproblems. We further introduce the auxiliary function to solve the optimization problems with rigorously proved convergence. The extensive experiments have been conducted on both synthetic and real- world data. All empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "authors": [{"name": "jin huang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81549297656"}, {"name": "feiping nie", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81365596650"}, {"name": "heng huang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81336489675"}, {"name": "yi-cheng tu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=86158942157"}, {"name": "yu lei", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=86159056757"}], "title": "Social trust prediction using heterogeneous networks", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "114\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "494\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of texas at arlington arlington tx", "city": "arlington", "Name": "jin huang"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of texas at arlington arlington tx", "city": "arlington", "Name": "feiping nie"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of texas at arlington arlington tx", "city": "arlington", "Name": "heng huang"}, {"country": "Cameroon", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of south florida", "city": "south", "Name": "yi-cheng tu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of texas at arlington", "city": null, "Name": "yu lei"}]}, "Article No.: 20": {"references": ["Hock Hee Ang , Vivekanand Gopalkrishnan , Steven C.

However, it is very challenging to perform classification in P2P networks due to many practical issues, such as scalability, peer dynamism, and asynchronism. This article investigates the practical techniques of constructing Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers in the P2P networks. In particular, we demonstrate how to efficiently cascade SVM in a P2P network with the use of reduced SVM. In addition, we propose to fuse the concept of cascade SVM with bootstrap aggregation to effectively balance the trade-off between classification accuracy, model construction, and prediction cost. We provide theoretical insights for the proposed solutions and conduct an extensive set of empirical studies on a number of large-scale datasets. Encouraging results validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.", "authors": [{"name": "hock hee ang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384612222"}, {"name": "vivekanand gopalkrishnan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319492485"}, {"name": "steven c h hoi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100337419"}, {"name": "wee keong ng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=86158809857"}], "title": "Classification in P2P networks with cascade support vector machines", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "43\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "222\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "singapore", "university": "nanyang technological university", "affiliation_string": "nanyang technological university singapore", "city": "singapore", "Name": "hock hee ang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "steven c h hoi", "city": null, "Name": "vivekanand gopalkrishnan"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "vivekanand gopalkrishnan", "city": null, "Name": "nanyang technological university singapore"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "vivekanand gopalkrishnan", "city": null, "Name": "nanyang technological university singapore"}]}}, "date": {"month": "November", "year": "2013"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Adams, W.

With this aim we introduce the Uncertain Nearest Neighbor (UNN) rule, which represents the generalization of the deterministic nearest neighbor rule to the case in which uncertain objects are available. The UNN rule relies on the concept of nearest neighbor class, rather than on that of nearest neighbor object. The nearest neighbor class of a test object is the class that maximizes the probability of providing its nearest neighbor. The evidence is that the former concept is much more powerful than the latter in the presence of uncertainty, in that it correctly models the right semantics of the nearest neighbor decision rule when applied to the uncertain scenario. An effective and efficient algorithm to perform uncertain nearest neighbor classification of a generic (un)certain test object is designed, based on properties that greatly reduce the temporal cost associated with nearest neighbor class probability computation. Experimental results are presented, showing that the UNN rule is effective and efficient in classifying uncertain data.", "authors": [{"name": "fabrizio angiulli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100400419"}, {"name": "fabio fassetti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314493715"}], "title": "Nearest Neighbor-Based Classification of Uncertain Data", "citations": [{"Name": "Lifei Chen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gongde Guo", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nearest neighbor classification of categorical data by attributes weighting", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "100\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "16\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "984\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "italy", "university": "university of calabria", "affiliation_string": "dimes university of calabria italy", "city": "cosenza", "Name": "fabrizio angiulli"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of calabria", "affiliation_string": "dimes university of calabria italy", "city": "cosenza", "Name": "fabio fassetti"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Agarwal, A. and Hazan, E. 2005.

All existing online portfolio selection strategies focus on the first order information of a portfolio vector, though the second order information may also be beneficial to a strategy. Moreover, empirical evidence shows that relative stock prices may follow the mean reversion property, which has not been fully exploited by existing strategies. This article proposes a novel online portfolio selection strategy namedConfidence Weighted Mean Reversion(CWMR). Inspired by the mean reversion principle in finance and confidence weighted online learning technique in machine learning, CWMR models the portfolio vector as a Gaussian distribution, and sequentially updates the distribution by following the mean reversion trading principle. CWMR\u2019s closed-form updates clearly reflect the mean reversion trading idea. We also present several variants of CWMR algorithms, including a CWMR mixture algorithm that is theoretical universal. Empirically, CWMR strategy is able to effectively exploit the power of mean reversion for online portfolio selection. Extensive experiments on various real markets show that the proposed strategy is superior to the state-of-the-art techniques. The experimental testbed including source codes and data sets is available online.", "authors": [{"name": "bin li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81484648153"}, {"name": "steven c h hoi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81501646172"}, {"name": "peilin zhao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81458641452"}, {"name": "vivekanand gopalkrishnan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319492485"}], "title": "Confidence Weighted Mean Reversion Strategy for Online Portfolio Selection", "citations": [{"Name": "Dingjiang Huang ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Junlong Zhou ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bin Li ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Steven C.

Most of the existing manifold ranking methods focus on learning a ranking function that varies smoothly along the data manifold. However, beyond smoothness, a desirable ranking function should vary monotonically along the geodesics of the data manifold, such that the ranking order along the geodesics is preserved. In this article, we aim to learn a ranking function that varies linearly and therefore monotonically along the geodesics of the data manifold. Recent theoretical work shows that the gradient field of a linear function on the manifold has to be a parallel vector field. Therefore, we propose a novel ranking algorithm on the data manifolds, called Parallel Field Ranking. Specifically, we try to learn a ranking function and a vector field simultaneously. We require the vector field to be close to the gradient field of the ranking function, and the vector field to be as parallel as possible. Moreover, we require the value of the ranking function at the query point to be the highest, and then decrease linearly along the manifold. Experimental results on both synthetic data and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.", "authors": [{"name": "ming ji", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81464667715"}, {"name": "binbin lin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83058656457"}, {"name": "xiaofei he", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418598002"}, {"name": "deng cai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100430245"}, {"name": "jiawei han", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83058901957"}], "title": "Parallel Field Ranking", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "28\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "254\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of illinois at urbana-champaign", "city": null, "Name": "ming ji"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "arizona state university", "city": null, "Name": "binbin lin"}, {"country": "china", "university": "zhejiang university", "affiliation_string": "zhejiang university", "city": "hangzhou", "Name": "xiaofei he"}, {"country": "china", "university": "zhejiang university", "affiliation_string": "zhejiang university", "city": "hangzhou", "Name": "deng cai"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of illinois at urbana-champaign", "city": null, "Name": "jiawei han"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Adams, N., Marquez, D., and Wakefield, G. 2005.

The difficulty of scaling a search to large datasets explains to a great extent why most academic work on time series data mining has plateaued at considering a few millions of time series objects, while much of industry and science sits on billions of time series objects waiting to be explored. In this work we show that by using a combination of four novel ideas we can search and mine massive time series for the first time. We demonstrate the following unintuitive fact: in large datasets we can exactly search under Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) much more quickly than the current state-of-the-artEuclidean distancesearch algorithms. We demonstrate our work on the largest set of time series experiments ever attempted. In particular, the largest dataset we consider is larger than the combined size of all of the time series datasets considered in all data mining papers ever published. We explain how our ideas allow us to solve higher-level time series data mining problems such as motif discovery and clustering at scales that would otherwise be untenable. Moreover, we show how our ideas allow us to efficiently support the uniform scaling distance measure, a measure whose utility seems to be underappreciated, but which we demonstrate here. In addition to mining massive datasets with up to one trillion datapoints, we will show that our ideas also have implications for real-time monitoring of data streams, allowing us to handle much faster arrival rates and/or use cheaper and lower powered devices than are currently possible.", "authors": [{"name": "thanawin rakthanmanon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81488642620"}, {"name": "bilson campana", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81481650910"}, {"name": "abdullah mueen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453650813"}, {"name": "gustavo batista", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100463169"}, {"name": "brandon westover", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81547995156"}, {"name": "qiang zhu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83058763457"}, {"name": "jesin zakaria", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81547998356"}, {"name": "eamonn keogh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81557365956"}], "title": "Addressing Big Data Time Series: Mining Trillions of Time Series Subsequences Under Dynamic Time Warping", "citations": [{"Name": "Jeremiah D.

Although active learning presents an attractive solution to this problem, previous approaches minimize the misclassification rate (0--1 loss) of the classifier, which is an unsuitable metric for entity matching due to class imbalance (i.e., many more nonduplicate pairs than duplicate pairs). To address this, a recent paper [Arasu et al. 2010] proposes to maximize recall of the classifier under the constraint that its precision should be greater than a specified threshold. However, the proposed technique requires the labels of allninput pairs in the worst case.Our main result is an active learning algorithm that approximately maximizes recall of the classifier while respecting a precision constraint with provably sublinear label complexity (under certain distributional assumptions). Our algorithm uses as a black box any active learning module that minimizes 0--1 loss. We show that label complexity of our algorithm is at most logntimes the label complexity of the black box, and also bound the difference in the recall of classifier learnt by our algorithm and the recall of the optimal classifier satisfying the precision constraint. We provide an empirical evaluation of our algorithm on several real-world matching data sets that demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.", "authors": [{"name": "kedar bellare", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81443596788"}, {"name": "suresh iyengar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83059079457"}, {"name": "aditya parameswaran", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81444604626"}, {"name": "vibhor rastogi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339523604"}], "title": "Active Sampling for Entity Matching with Guarantees", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "37\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "242\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "suresh iyengar", "city": null, "Name": "kedar bellare"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "aditya parameswaran", "city": null, "Name": "yahoo research and microsoft research lab india"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "vibhor rastogi", "city": null, "Name": "yahoo research and stanford university"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["Steffen Bickel , Michael Br\u00fcckner , Tobias Scheffer, Discriminative Learning Under Covariate Shift, The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 10, p.2137-2155, 12/1/2009\n", "Karsten M.

A major challenge for link-based clustering in such networks is their potential to generate many different results, carrying rather diverse semantic meanings. In order to generate desired clustering, we propose to usemeta-path, a path that connects object types via a sequence of relations, to control clustering with distinct semantics. Nevertheless, it is easier for a user to provide a few examples (seeds) than a weighted combination of sophisticated meta-paths to specify her clustering preference. Thus, we propose to integratemeta-path selectionwithuser-guided clusteringto cluster objects in networks, where a user first provides a small set of object seeds for each cluster as guidance. Then the system learns the weight for each meta-path that is consistent with the clustering result implied by the guidance, and generates clusters under the learned weights of meta-paths. A probabilistic approach is proposed to solve the problem, and an effective and efficient iterative algorithm,PathSelClus, is proposed to learn the model, where the clustering quality and the meta-path weights mutually enhance each other. Our experiments with several clustering tasks in two real networks and one synthetic network demonstrate the power of the algorithm in comparison with the baselines.", "authors": [{"name": "yizhou sun", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82658853557"}, {"name": "brandon norick", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81467667616"}, {"name": "jiawei han", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548005096"}, {"name": "xifeng yan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81556254756"}, {"name": "philip s yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83058815957"}, {"name": "xiao yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81486653339"}], "title": "PathSelClus: Integrating Meta-Path Selection with User-Guided Object Clustering in Heterogeneous Information Networks", "citations": [{"Name": "Xun Lu ", "Country": "georgia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Aston Zhang ", "Country": "georgia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Carl A.

For example, an image can be represented as a bag of segments and associated with a list of objects it contains. Prior work on MIML has focused on predicting label sets for previously unseen bags. We instead consider the problem of predicting instance labels while learning from data labeled only at the bag level. We propose a regularized rank-loss objective designed for instance annotation, which can be instantiated with different aggregation models connecting instance-level labels with bag-level label sets. The aggregation models that we consider can be factored as a linear function of a \u201csupport instance\u201d for each class, which is a single feature vector representing a whole bag. Hence we name our proposed methods rank-loss Support Instance Machines (SIM). We propose two optimization methods for the rank-loss objective, which is nonconvex. One is a heuristic method that alternates between updating support instances, and solving a convex problem in which the support instances are treated as constant. The other is to apply the constrained concave-convex procedure (CCCP), which can also be interpreted as iteratively updating support instances and solving a convex problem. To solve the convex problem, we employ the Pegasos framework of primal subgradient descent, and prove that it finds an &epsi;-suboptimal solution in runtime that is linear in the number of bags, instances, and 1/&epsi;. Additionally, we suggest a method of extending the linear learning algorithm to nonlinear classification, without increasing the runtime asymptotically. Experiments on artificial and real-world datasets including images and audio show that the proposed methods achieve higher accuracy than other loss functions used in prior work, e.g., Hamming loss, and recent work in ambiguous label classification.", "authors": [{"name": "forrest briggs", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453629345"}, {"name": "xiaoli z fern", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100360432"}, {"name": "raviv raich", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81416606228"}, {"name": "qi lou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83058994657"}], "title": "Instance Annotation for Multi-Instance Multi-Label Learning", "citations": [{"Name": "Forrest Briggs ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiaoli Z.

However, big data are often characterized by high dimensionality, which makes knowledge discovery more difficult. Many techniques for dimensionality reudction have been proposed, including well-known Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). However, the Fisher criterion is incapable of dealing with heteroscedasticity in the data. A technique based on the Chernoff criterion for linear dimensionality reduction has been proposed that is capable of exploiting heteroscedastic information in the data. While the Chernoff criterion has been shown to outperform the Fisher's, a clear understanding of its exact behavior is lacking. In this article, we show precisely what can be expected from the Chernoff criterion. In particular, we show that the Chernoff criterion exploits the Fisher and Fukunaga-Koontz transforms in computing its linear discriminants. Furthermore, we show that a recently proposed decomposition of the data space into four subspaces is incomplete. We provide arguments on how to best enrich the decomposition of the data space in order to account for heteroscedasticity in the data. Finally, we provide experimental results validating our theoretical analysis.", "authors": [{"name": "jing peng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81558554456"}, {"name": "guna seetharaman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452615257"}, {"name": "wei fan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82459241857"}, {"name": "aparna varde", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100188513"}], "title": "Exploiting fisher and fukunaga-koontz transforms in chernoff dimensionality reduction", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "35\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "235\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "montclair state university", "city": null, "Name": "jing peng"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "air force research lab", "city": null, "Name": "guna seetharaman"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "aparna varde", "city": null, "Name": "wei fan"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "guna seetharaman", "city": null, "Name": "montclair state university"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Aaker, D.

Previous MTFS methods fulfill this task by batch-mode training. This makes them inefficient when data come sequentially or when the number of training data is so large that they cannot be loaded into the memory simultaneously. In order to tackle these problems, we propose a novel online learning framework to solve the MTFS problem. A main advantage of the online algorithm is its efficiency in both time complexity and memory cost. The weights of the MTFS models at each iteration can be updated by closed-form solutions based on the average of previous subgradients. This yields the worst-case bounds of the time complexity and memory cost at each iteration, both in the order ofO(d\u00d7Q), wheredis the number of feature dimensions andQis the number of tasks. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis for the average regret of the online learning algorithms, which also guarantees the convergence rate of the algorithms. Finally, we conduct detailed experiments to show the characteristics and merits of the online learning algorithms in solving several MTFS problems.", "authors": [{"name": "haiqin yang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81430666650"}, {"name": "michael r lyu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100033051"}, {"name": "irwin king", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474647367"}], "title": "Efficient online learning for multitask feature selection", "citations": [{"Name": "Junjie Hu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Haiqin Yang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Irwin King ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michael R.

A characteristic shared by many multilabel learning problems is that some labels have significant correlations between them. In this article, we propose a novel multilabel learning method, called MultiLabel Relationship Learning (MLRL), which extends the conventional support vector machine by explicitly learning and utilizing the relationships between labels. Specifically, we model the label relationships using a label covariance matrix and use it to define a new regularization term for the optimization problem. MLRL learns the model parameters and the label covariance matrix simultaneously based on a unified convex formulation. To solve the convex optimization problem, we use an alternating method in which each subproblem can be solved efficiently. The relationship between MLRL and two widely used maximum margin methods for multilabel learning is investigated. Moreover, we also propose a semisupervised extension of MLRL, called SSMLRL, to demonstrate how to make use of unlabeled data to help learn the label covariance matrix. Through experiments conducted on some multilabel applications, we find that MLRL not only gives higher classification accuracy but also has better interpretability as revealed by the label covariance matrix.", "authors": [{"name": "yu zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82458781057"}, {"name": "dit-yan yeung", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82459104157"}], "title": "Multilabel relationship learning", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "98\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "11\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "527\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "hong kong", "university": "hong kong baptist university", "affiliation_string": "hong kong baptist university", "city": "jiulong", "Name": "yu zhang"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "hong kong university of science and technology", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "dit-yan yeung"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Lars Backstrom , Ravi Kumar , Cameron Marlow , Jasmine Novak , Andrew Tomkins, Preferential behavior in online groups, Proceedings of the 2008 International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, February 11-12, 2008, Palo Alto, California, USA[doi>10.1145/1341531.1341549]\n", "Lars Backstrom , Jure Leskovec, Supervised random walks: predicting and recommending links in social networks, Proceedings of the fourth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining, February 09-12, 2011, Hong Kong, China[doi>10.1145/1935826.1935914]\n", "Cha, M., Haddadi, H., Benevenuto, F., and Gummadi, P.

In particular, we focus on investigating how a reciprocal (two-way) link, the basic relationship in social networks, is developed from a parasocial (one-way) relationship and how the relationships further develop into triadic closure, one of the fundamental processes of link formation.We first investigate how geographic distance and interactions between users influence the formation of link structure among users. Then we study how social theories including homophily, social balance, and social status are satisfied over networks with parasocial and reciprocal relationships. The study unveils several interesting phenomena. For example, \u201cfriend's friend is a friend\u201d indeed exists in the reciprocal relationship network, but does not hold in the parasocial relationship network.We propose a learning framework to formulate the problems of predicting reciprocity and triadic closure into a graphical model. We demonstrate that it is possible to accurately infer 90&percnt; of reciprocal relationships in a Twitter network. The proposed model also achieves better performance (&plus;20--30&percnt; in terms of F1-measure) than several alternative methods for predicting the triadic closure formation.", "authors": [{"name": "tiancheng lou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413604280"}, {"name": "jie tang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82458770657"}, {"name": "john hopcroft", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100008350"}, {"name": "zhanpeng fang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82458919957"}, {"name": "xiaowen ding", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82459086957"}], "title": "Learning to predict reciprocity and triadic closure in social networks", "citations": [{"Name": "Rahul Saha ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "G.

This problem can be viewed as clustering the vertices of a graph whose edges are of different types (colors). We introduce an objective function that ensures the edges within each cluster have, as much as possible, the same color. We show that the problem isNP-hard and propose a randomized algorithm with approximation guarantee proportional to the maximum degree of the input graph. The algorithm iteratively picks a random edge as a pivot, builds a cluster around it, and removes the cluster from the graph. Although being fast, easy to implement, and parameter-free, this algorithm tends to produce a relatively large number of clusters. To overcome this issue we introduce a variant algorithm, which modifies how the pivot is chosen and how the cluster is built around the pivot. Finally, to address the case where a fixed number of output clusters is required, we devise a third algorithm that directly optimizes the objective function based on thealternating-minimizationparadigm.We also extend our objective function to handle cases where object\u2019s relations are described by multiple labels. We modify our randomized approximation algorithm to optimize such an extended objective function and show that its approximation guarantee remains proportional to the maximum degree of the graph.We test our algorithms on synthetic and real data from the domains of social media, protein-interaction networks, and bibliometrics. Results reveal that our algorithms outperform a baseline algorithm both in the task of reconstructing a ground-truth clustering and in terms of objective-function value.", "authors": [{"name": "francesco bonchi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100305585"}, {"name": "aristides gionis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100631289"}, {"name": "francesco gullo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81335491254"}, {"name": "charalampos e tsourakakis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384619692"}, {"name": "antti ukkonen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100574014"}], "title": "Chromatic Correlation Clustering", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "156\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "25\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "156\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "spain", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "yahoo labs spain", "city": null, "Name": "francesco bonchi"}, {"country": "finland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "aalto university finland", "city": null, "Name": "aristides gionis"}, {"country": "spain", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "yahoo labs spain", "city": null, "Name": "francesco gullo"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "harvard school of engineering and applied sciences", "city": null, "Name": "charalampos e tsourakakis"}, {"country": "finland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "aalto university and finnish institute of occupational health finland", "city": null, "Name": "antti ukkonen"}]}, "Article No.: 32": {"references": ["A.

Product ratings are important because they affect how well a product will be adopted by the market. The challenge is that we only have partial information on these ratings: each user assigns ratings to only a small subset of products. Under this partial information setting, we explore a number of fundamental questions. What is the minimum number of ratings a product needs so that one can make a reliable evaluation of its quality&quest; How may users\u2019 misbehavior, such as cheating in product rating, affect the evaluation result&quest; To answer these questions, we present a probabilistic model to capture various important factors (e.g., rating aggregation rules, rating behavior) that may influence the product quality assessment under the partial information setting. We derive the minimum number of ratings needed to produce a reliable indicator on the quality of a product. We extend our model to accommodate users\u2019 misbehavior in product rating. We derive the maximum fraction of misbehaving users that a rating aggregation rule can tolerate and the minimum number of ratings needed to compensate. We carry out experiments using both synthetic and real-world data (from Amazon and TripAdvisor). We not only validate our model but also show that the \u201caverage rating rule\u201d produces more reliable and robust product quality assessments than the \u201cmajority rating rule\u201d and the \u201cmedian rating rule\u201d in aggregating product ratings.

Quantification has several applications in data and text mining, such as estimating the prevalence of positive reviews in a set of reviews of a given product or estimating the prevalence of a given support issue in a dataset of transcripts of phone calls to tech support. So far, quantification has been addressed by learning a general-purpose classifier, counting the unlabeled items that have been assigned the class, and tuning the obtained counts according to some heuristics. In this article, we depart from the tradition of using general-purpose classifiers and use instead a supervised learning model forstructured prediction, capable of generating classifiers directly optimized for the (multivariate and nonlinear) function used for evaluating quantification accuracy. The experiments that we have run on 5,500 binary high-dimensional datasets (averaging more than 14,000 documents each) show that this method is more accurate, more stable, and more efficient than existing state-of-the-art quantification methods.", "authors": [{"name": "andrea esuli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309512045"}, {"name": "fabrizio sebastiani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81541678556"}], "title": "Optimizing Text Quantifiers for Multivariate Loss Functions", "citations": [{"Name": "Wei Gao ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fabrizio Sebastiani", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Preslav Nakov ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sara Rosenthal ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Svetlana Kiritchenko ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Saif M.

Including more information from other domains is a natural solution to improve the recommendations. However, most previous work in cross-domain recommendations has focused on improving prediction accuracy with several severe limitations. In this article, we extend our previous work on clustering-based matrix factorization in single domains into cross domains. In addition, we utilize recent results on unobserved ratings. Our new method can more effectively utilize data from auxiliary domains to achieve better recommendations, especially for cold-start users. For example, our method improves the recall to 21&percnt; on average for cold-start users, whereas previous methods result in only 15&percnt; recall in the cross-domain Amazon dataset. We also observe almost the same improvements in the Epinions dataset. Considering that it is often difficult to make even a small improvement in recommendations, for cold- start users in particular, our result is quite significant.", "authors": [{"name": "nima mirbakhsh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81444605684"}, {"name": "charles x ling", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100159332"}], "title": "Improving Top-N Recommendation for Cold-Start Users via Cross-Domain Information", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "433\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "28\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "433\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "cambodia", "university": "western university", "affiliation_string": "western university london on canada", "city": "phnum penh", "Name": "nima mirbakhsh"}, {"country": "cambodia", "university": "western university", "affiliation_string": "western university london on canada", "city": "phnum penh", "Name": "charles x ling"}]}, "Article No.: 29": {"references": ["N.

If these problems are left untreated, the consequent clustering results cannot accurately represent true data patterns, in particular, for complex real-world datasets with heterogeneous densities. This article aims to solve these problems by proposing a diffusion-based Aggregated Heat Kernel (AHK) to improve the clustering stability, and a Local Density Affinity Transformation (LDAT) to correct the bias originating from different cluster densities. AHK statistically models the heat diffusion traces along the entire time scale, so it ensures robustness during the clustering process, while LDAT probabilistically reveals the local density of each instance and suppresses the local density bias in the affinity matrix. Our proposed framework integrates these two techniques systematically. As a result, it not only provides an advanced noise-resisting and density-aware spectral mapping to the original dataset but also demonstrates the stability during the processing of tuning the scaling parameter (which usually controls the range of neighborhood). Furthermore, our framework works well with the majority of similarity kernels, which ensures its applicability to many types of data and problem domains. The systematic experiments on different applications show that our proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art clustering algorithms for the data with heterogeneous density distributions and achieves robust clustering performance with respect to tuning the scaling parameter and handling various levels and types of noise.", "authors": [{"name": "hao huang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81496654701"}, {"name": "shinjae yoo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436598883"}, {"name": "dantong yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100471739"}, {"name": "hong qin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100550215"}], "title": "Density-Aware Clustering Based on Aggregated Heat Kernel and Its Transformation", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "148\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "12\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "148\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "computer science department stony brook university ny", "city": null, "Name": "hao huang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "computational science center brookhaven national laboratory ny", "city": null, "Name": "shinjae yoo"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "computational science center brookhaven national laboratory ny", "city": null, "Name": "dantong yu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "computer science department stony brook university ny", "city": null, "Name": "hong qin"}]}, "Article No.: 30": {"references": ["Charu C.

It is a new research problem to learn and maintain a classifier to deal with very high dimensionality or streaming features. In this article, we adapt the well-known emerging-pattern--based classification models and propose a semi-streaming approach. For streaming features, it is computationally expensive or even prohibitive to mine long-emerging patterns, and it is nontrivial to integrate emerging-pattern mining with feature selection. We present an online feature selection step, which is capable of selecting and maintaining a pool of effective features from a feature stream. Then, in our offline step, separated from the online step, we periodically compute and update emerging patterns from the pool of selected features from the online step. We evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method using a series of benchmark datasets and a real-world case study on Mars crater detection. Our proposed method yields classification performance comparable to the state-of-art static classification methods.

A scientist must first formulate a hypothesis based on what he or she sees and then devise a variety of experiments to test it. Given the rapid growth of data, it has become virtually impossible for a person to manually inspect all data to find all of the interesting hypotheses for testing. In this article, we propose and develop a data-driven framework for automatic hypothesis testing and analysis. We define a hypothesis as a comparison between two or more subpopulations. We find subpopulations for comparison using frequent pattern mining techniques and then pair them up for statistical hypothesis testing. We also generate additional information for further analysis of the hypotheses that are deemed significant. The number of hypotheses generated can be very large, and many of them are very similar. We develop algorithms to remove redundant hypotheses and present a succinct set of significant hypotheses to users. We conducted a set of experiments to show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The results show that our system can help users (1) identify significant hypotheses efficiently, (2) isolate the reasons behind significant hypotheses efficiently, and (3) find confounding factors that form Simpson\u2019s paradoxes with discovered significant hypotheses.", "authors": [{"name": "guimei liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453607353"}, {"name": "haojun zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81492656549"}, {"name": "mengling feng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100140638"}, {"name": "limsoon wong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452618356"}, {"name": "see-kiong ng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100470830"}], "title": "Supporting Exploratory Hypothesis Testing and Analysis", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "112\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "11\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "112\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "singapore", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "institute for infocomm research singapore", "city": null, "Name": "guimei liu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wisconsin--madison usa", "city": null, "Name": "haojun zhang"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "institute for infocomm research singapore", "city": null, "Name": "mengling feng"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": "national university of singapore", "affiliation_string": "national university of singapore singapore", "city": "singapore", "Name": "limsoon wong"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "institute for infocomm research singapore", "city": null, "Name": "see-kiong ng"}]}}, "date": {"month": "June", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 7": {"references": ["David W.

This article first distinguishes the algorithm recommendation methods by two dimensions: (1) meta-features, which are a set of measures used to characterize the learning problems, and (2) meta-target, which represents the relative performance of the classification algorithms on the learning problem. In contrast to the existing algorithm recommendation methods whose meta-target is usually in the form of either the ranking of candidate algorithms or a single algorithm, this article proposes a new and natural multilabel form to describe the meta-target. This is due to the fact that there would be multiple algorithms being appropriate for a given problem in practice. Furthermore, a novel multilabel learning-based generic algorithm recommendation method is proposed, which views the algorithm recommendation as a multilabel learning problem and solves the problem by the mature multilabel learning algorithms. To evaluate the proposed multilabel learning-based recommendation method, extensive experiments with 13 well-known classification algorithms, two kinds of meta-targets such as algorithm ranking and single algorithm, and five different kinds of meta-features are conducted on 1,090 benchmark learning problems. The results show the effectiveness of our proposed multilabel learning-based recommendation method.", "authors": [{"name": "guangtao wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81500658415"}, {"name": "qinbao song", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81553218356"}, {"name": "xueying zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87059712157"}, {"name": "kaiyuan zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658641706"}], "title": "A Generic Multilabel Learning-Based Classification Algorithm Recommendation Method", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "136\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "17\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "283\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "china", "university": "xian jiaotong university", "affiliation_string": "xian jiaotong university china", "city": "xian", "Name": "guangtao wang"}, {"country": "china", "university": "xian jiaotong university", "affiliation_string": "xian jiaotong university china", "city": "xian", "Name": "qinbao song"}, {"country": "china", "university": "xian jiaotong university", "affiliation_string": "xian jiaotong university china", "city": "xian", "Name": "xueying zhang"}, {"country": "china", "university": "xian jiaotong university", "affiliation_string": "xian jiaotong university china", "city": "xian", "Name": "kaiyuan zhang"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Charu C.

Existing works apply the standard nonparametric Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) to approximate the PDF of data streams. As a result, the stream-based KDEs cannot accurately capture complex local density features. In this article, we propose the use of Local Region (LRs) to model local density information in univariate data streams. In-depth theoretical analyses are presented to justify the effectiveness of the LR-based KDE. Based on the analyses, we develop the General Local rEgion AlgorithM (GLEAM) to enhance the estimation quality of structurally complex univariate distributions for existing stream-based KDEs. A set of algorithmic optimizations is designed to improve the query throughput of GLEAM and to achieve its linear order computation. Additionally, a comprehensive suite of experiments was conducted to test the effectiveness and efficiency of GLEAM.", "authors": [{"name": "arnold p boedihardjo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81313483653"}, {"name": "chang-tien lu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100053980"}, {"name": "bingsheng wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81556448856"}], "title": "A Framework for Exploiting Local Information to Enhance Density Estimation of Data Streams", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "58\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "180\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "chang-tien lu", "city": null, "Name": "arnold p boedihardjo"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "bingsheng wang", "city": null, "Name": "virginia tech falls church va"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "bingsheng wang", "city": null, "Name": "virginia tech falls church va"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["A.

Such models can also help detect possible differences between training and target distributions, which is useful in applications where concept drift may take place, as in transfer learning settings. This article describes a general optimization framework that takes as input class membership estimates from existing classifiers learned on previously encountered \u201csource\u201d (or training) data, as well as a similarity matrix from a cluster ensemble operating solely on the target (or test) data to be classified, and yields a consensus labeling of the target data. More precisely, the application settings considered are nontransductive semisupervised and transfer learning scenarios where the training data are used only to build an ensemble of classifiers and are subsequently discarded before classifying the target data. The framework admits a wide range of loss functions and classification/clustering methods. It exploits properties of Bregman divergences in conjunction with Legendre duality to yield a principled and scalable approach. A variety of experiments show that the proposed framework can yield results substantially superior to those provided by na\u00efvely applying classifiers learned on the original task to the target data. In addition, we show that the proposed approach, even not being conceptually transductive, can provide better results compared to some popular transductive learning techniques.", "authors": [{"name": "ayan acharya", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81488643704"}, {"name": "eduardo r hruschka", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100032982"}, {"name": "joydeep ghosh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81488659908"}, {"name": "sreangsu acharyya", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81363593075"}], "title": "An Optimization Framework for Combining Ensembles of Classifiers and Clusterers with Applications to Nontransductive Semisupervised Learning and Transfer Learning", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "106\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "319\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of texas at austin austin usa", "city": "austin", "Name": "ayan acharya"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of texas at austin university of sao paulo at sao carlos brazil", "city": "austin", "Name": "eduardo r hruschka"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of texas at austin austin usa", "city": "austin", "Name": "joydeep ghosh"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of texas at austin austin usa", "city": "austin", "Name": "sreangsu acharyya"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Leman Akoglu, Hanghang Tong, Brendan Meeder, and Christos Faloutsos. 2012.

In recent years, with the proliferation of rich attribute information available for objects in real-world graphs, how to leverage not only structural but also attribute information forclustering attributed graphsbecomes a new challenge. Most existing works took a distance-based approach. They proposed various distance measures to fuse structural and attribute information and then applied standard techniques for graph clustering based on these distance measures. In this article, we take an alternative view and propose a novel Bayesian framework for attributed graph clustering. Our framework provides a general and principled solution to modeling both the structural and the attribute aspects of a graph. It avoids the artificial design of a distance measure in existing methods and, furthermore, can seamlessly handle graphs with different types of edges and vertex attributes. We develop an efficient variational method for graph clustering under this framework and derive two concrete algorithms for clustering unweighted and weighted attributed graphs. Experimental results on large real-world datasets show that our algorithms significantly outperform the state-of-the-art distance-based method, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.", "authors": [{"name": "zhiqiang xu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502756598"}, {"name": "yiping ke", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658633689"}, {"name": "yi wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658632091"}, {"name": "hong cheng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351596071"}, {"name": "james cheng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81758940257"}], "title": "GBAGC: A General Bayesian Framework for Attributed Graph Clustering", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "111\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "14\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "309\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "singapore", "university": "nanyang technological university", "affiliation_string": "nanyang technological university nanyang avenue singapore", "city": "singapore", "Name": "zhiqiang xu"}, {"country": "Hong Kong", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "institute of high performance computing connexis north singapore", "city": "north", "Name": "yiping ke"}, {"country": "Hong Kong", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "institute of high performance computing connexis north singapore", "city": "north", "Name": "yi wang"}, {"country": "hong kong", "university": "university of hong kong", "affiliation_string": "the chinese university of hong kong hong kong", "city": "xianggangdao", "Name": "hong cheng"}, {"country": "hong kong", "university": "university of hong kong", "affiliation_string": "the chinese university of hong kong hong kong", "city": "xianggangdao", "Name": "james cheng"}]}, "Article No.: 3": {"references": ["A.

The main disadvantage of MCMC methods is the large number of iterations they need to sample the posterior distributions of model parameters, especially for large datasets. On the other hand, variable selection remains a challenging problem due to its combinatorial search space, where Bayesian models are a promising solution. In this work, we study how to accelerate Bayesian model computation for variable selection in linear regression. We propose a fast Gibbs sampler algorithm, a widely used MCMC method that incorporates several optimizations. We use a Zellner prior for the regression coefficients, an improper prior on variance, and a conjugate prior Gaussian distribution, which enable dataset summarization in one pass, thus exploiting an augmented set of sufficient statistics. Thereafter, the algorithm iterates in main memory. Sufficient statistics are indexed with a sparse binary vector to efficiently compute matrix projections based on selected variables. Discovered variable subsets probabilities, selecting and discarding each variable, are stored on a hash table for fast retrieval in future iterations. We study how to integrate our algorithm into a Database Management System (DBMS), exploiting aggregate User-Defined Functions for parallel data summarization and stored procedures to manipulate matrices with arrays. An experimental evaluation with real datasets evaluates accuracy and time performance, comparing our DBMS-based algorithm with the R package. Our algorithm is shown to produce accurate results, scale linearly on dataset size, and run orders of magnitude faster than the R package.", "authors": [{"name": "carlos ordonez", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100618426"}, {"name": "carlos garcia-alvarado", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384620530"}, {"name": "veerabhadaran baladandayuthapani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81479664832"}], "title": "Bayesian Variable Selection in Linear Regression in One Pass for Large Datasets", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "68\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "171\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of houston", "city": null, "Name": "carlos ordonez"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of houston", "city": null, "Name": "carlos garcia-alvarado"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Yong-Yeol Ahn, James P.

Traditional approaches are based on the assumption that there is a global-level organization in the network. However, in many scenarios, each node is the bearer of complex information and cannot be classified in disjoint clusters. The top-down global view of the partition approach is not designed for this. Here, we represent this complex information as multiple latent labels, and we postulate that edges in the networks are created among nodes carrying similar labels. The latent labels are the communities a node belongs to and we discover them with a simple local-first approach to community discovery. This is achieved by democratically letting each node vote for the communities it sees surrounding it in its limited view of the global system, its ego neighborhood, using a label propagation algorithm, assuming that each node is aware of the label it shares with each of its connections. The local communities are merged hierarchically, unveiling the modular organization of the network at the global level and identifying overlapping groups and groups of groups. We tested this intuition against the state-of-the-art overlapping community discovery and found that our new method advances in the chosen scenarios in the quality of the obtained communities. We perform a test on benchmark and on real-world networks, evaluating the quality of the community coverage by using the extracted communities to predict the metadata attached to the nodes, which we consider external information about the latent labels. We also provide an explanation about why real-world networks contain overlapping communities and how our logic is able to capture them. Finally, we show how our method is deterministic, is incremental, and has a limited time complexity, so that it can be used on real-world scale networks.", "authors": [{"name": "michele coscia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442618468"}, {"name": "giulio rossetti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81496686763"}, {"name": "fosca giannotti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100458577"}, {"name": "dino pedreschi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100352341"}], "title": "Uncovering Hierarchical and Overlapping Communities with a Local-First Approach", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "93\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "11\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "246\n", "Citation Count": "4\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cid - harvard kennedy school cambridge ma us", "city": "cambridge", "Name": "michele coscia"}, {"country": "Italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "kddlab isti-cnr pisa italy", "city": "pisa", "Name": "giulio rossetti"}, {"country": "Italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "kddlab isti-cnr pisa italy", "city": "pisa", "Name": "fosca giannotti"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of pisa", "affiliation_string": "computer science department university of pisa pisa italy", "city": "pisa", "Name": "dino pedreschi"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["C.

In this article, we propose a generalized logit boost algorithm in which base learners have structural relationships in the functional space. Although such relationships are generic, our work is particularly motivated by the emerging topic of pattern-based classification for semistructured data including graphs. Toward an efficient incorporation of the structure information, we have designed a general model in which we use an undirected graph to capture the relationship of subgraph-based base learners. In our method, we employ bothL1and Laplacian-basedL2regularization to logit boosting to achieve model sparsity and smoothness in the functional space spanned by the base learners. We have derived efficient optimization algorithms based on coordinate descent for the new boosting formulation and theoretically prove that it exhibits a natural grouping effect for nearby spatial or overlapping base learners and that the resulting estimator is consistent. Additionally, motivated by the connection between logit boosting and logistic regression, we extend our structured sparse regularization framework to logistic regression for vectorial data in which features are structured. Using comprehensive experimental study and comparing our work with the state-of-the-art, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed learning method.", "authors": [{"name": "hongliang fei", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384615965"}, {"name": "jun huan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81479644488"}], "title": "Structured Sparse Boosting for Graph Classification", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "112\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "13\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "279\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "New Zealand", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "eecs department university of kansas lawrence ks", "city": "lawrence", "Name": "hongliang fei"}, {"country": "New Zealand", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "eecs department university of kansas lawrence ks", "city": "lawrence", "Name": "jun huan"}]}}, "date": {"month": "October", "year": "2014"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 22": {"references": ["Dimitris Achlioptas , Aaron Clauset , David Kempe , Cristopher Moore, On the bias of traceroute sampling: or, power-law degree distributions in regular graphs, Proceedings of the thirty-seventh annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing, May 22-24, 2005, Baltimore, MD, USA[doi>10.1145/1060590.1060693]\n", "Yong-Yeol Ahn , Seungyeop Han , Haewoon Kwak , Sue Moon , Hawoong Jeong, Analysis of topological characteristics of huge online social networking services, Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web, May 08-12, 2007, Banff, Alberta, Canada[doi>10.1145/1242572.1242685]\n", "Konstantin Avrachenkov, Bruno Ribeiro, and Don Towsley. 2010.

Due to the large-scale nature of such networks, it is infeasible to enumerate all user pairs and thus sampling is used. In this article, we show that it is a great challenge for OSN service providers to characterize user pair relationships, even when they possess the complete graph topology. The reason is that when sampling techniques (i.e., uniform vertex sampling (UVS) and random walk (RW)) are naively applied, they can introduce large biases, particularly for estimating similarity distribution of user pairs with constraints like existence of mutual neighbors, which is important for applications such as identifying network homophily. Estimating statistics of user pairs is more challenging in the absence of the complete topology information, as an unbiased sampling technique like UVS is usually not allowed and exploring the OSN graph topology is expensive. To address these challenges, we present unbiased sampling methods to characterize user pair properties based on UVS and RW techniques. We carry out an evaluation of our methods to show their accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we apply our methods to three OSNs\u2014Foursquare, Douban, and Xiami\u2014and discover that significant homophily is present in these networks.", "authors": [{"name": "pinghui wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82458997157"}, {"name": "junzhou zhao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82458731157"}, {"name": "john c s lui", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350583141"}, {"name": "don towsley", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81405594423"}, {"name": "xiaohong guan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100084544"}], "title": "Unbiased Characterization of Node Pairs over Large Graphs", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "130\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "130\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "junzhou zhao", "city": null, "Name": "pinghui wang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "john c s lui", "city": null, "Name": "xian jiaotong university china"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "don towsley", "city": null, "Name": "chinese university of hong kong shatin hong kong"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "xiaohong guan", "city": null, "Name": "university of massachusetts amherst ma"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "john c s lui", "city": null, "Name": "xian jiaotong university china"}]}, "Article No.: 15": {"references": ["Nesreen K.

We run a detailed set of experiments on a variety of real graphs and demonstrate that the memory requirement of the algorithm is a tiny fraction of the graph. For example, even for a graph with 200 million edges, our algorithm stores just 40,000 edges to give accurate results.

This has amplified the interest in right-protection mechanisms to establish ownership in the event of data leakage. Current right-protection technologies, however, rarely provide strong guarantees on dataset utility after the protection process. This work presents techniques that explicitly address this topic and provably preserve the outcome of certain mining operations. In particular, we take special care to guarantee that the outcome of hierarchical clustering operations remains the same before and after right protection. Our approach considers all prevalent hierarchical clustering variants: single-, complete-, and average-linkage. We imprint the ownership in a dataset using watermarking principles, and we derive tight bounds on the expansion/contraction of distances incurred by the process. We leverage our analysis to design fast algorithms for right protection without exhaustively searching the vast design space. Finally, because the right-protection process introduces a user-tunable distortion on the dataset, we explore the possibility of using this mechanism for data obfuscation. We quantify the tradeoff between obfuscation and utility for spatiotemporal datasets and discover very favorable characteristics of the process. An additional advantage is that when one is interested in both right-protecting and obfuscating the original data values, the proposed mechanism can accomplish both tasks simultaneously.", "authors": [{"name": "michail vlachos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100026796"}, {"name": "johannes schneider", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548492256"}, {"name": "vassilios g vassiliadis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658655189"}], "title": "On Data Publishing with Clustering Preservation", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "179\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "16\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "179\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Switzerland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm research - zurich raschlikon switzerland", "city": "zurich", "Name": "michail vlachos"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "vassilios g vassiliadis", "city": null, "Name": "johannes schneider"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "johannes schneider", "city": null, "Name": "ibm research - zurich raschlikon switzerland"}]}, "Article No.: 18": {"references": ["Paul N.

The key idea in both approaches is to reinforce the similarity among parameter across the nodes in a hierarchy or network based on the proximity and connectivity of the nodes. For scalability, we develop hierarchical variational inference algorithms and fast dual coordinate descent training procedures with parallelization. In our experiments for classification problems with hundreds of thousands of classes and millions of training instances with terabytes of parameters, the proposed methods show consistent and statistically significant improvements over other competing approaches, and the best results on multiple benchmark datasets for large-scale classification.", "authors": [{"name": "siddharth gopal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81466640924"}, {"name": "yiming yang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351593798"}], "title": "Hierarchical Bayesian Inference and Recursive Regularization for Large-Scale Classification", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "152\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "152\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa", "city": "pittsburgh", "Name": "siddharth gopal"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa", "city": "pittsburgh", "Name": "yiming yang"}]}, "Article No.: 16": {"references": ["A.

The CPS has wide applications in scenarios such as environment monitoring, battlefield surveillance, and traffic control. One key research problem of CPS is calledmining lines in the sand. With a large number of sensors (sand) deployed in a designated area, the CPS is required to discover all trajectories (lines) of passing intruders in real time. There are two crucial challenges that need to be addressed: (1) the collected sensor data are not trustworthy, and (2) the intruders do not send out any identification information. The system needs to distinguish multiple intruders and track their movements. This study proposes a method calledLiSM(Line-in-the-Sand Miner) to discover trajectories from untrustworthy sensor data.LiSMconstructs a watching network from sensor data and computes the locations of intruder appearances based on the link information of the network. The system retrieves acone modelfrom the historical trajectories to track multiple intruders. Finally, the system validates the mining results and updates sensors\u2019 reliability scores in a feedback process. In addition,LoRM(Line-on-the-Road Miner) is proposed for trajectory discovery on road networks\u2014mining lines on the roads.LoRMemploys a filtering-and-refinement framework to reduce the distance computational overhead on road networks and uses a shortest-path-measure to track intruders. The proposed methods are evaluated with extensive experiments on big datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed methods achieve higher accuracy and efficiency in trajectory mining tasks.", "authors": [{"name": "lu-an tang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375605800"}, {"name": "xiao yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81486653339"}, {"name": "quanquan gu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436598990"}, {"name": "jiawei han", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351593425"}, {"name": "guofei jiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81336489979"}, {"name": "alice leung", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81503662813"}, {"name": "thomas la porta", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350601077"}], "title": "A Framework of Mining Trajectories from Untrustworthy Data in Cyber-Physical System", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "299\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "24\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "360\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "nec labs america princeton nj", "city": null, "Name": "lu-an tang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of illinois at urbana-champaign urbana il", "city": null, "Name": "xiao yu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of illinois at urbana-champaign urbana il", "city": null, "Name": "quanquan gu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of illinois at urbana-champaign urbana il", "city": null, "Name": "jiawei han"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "nec labs america princeton nj", "city": null, "Name": "guofei jiang"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "bbn technology cambridge ma", "city": "cambridge", "Name": "alice leung"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "pennsylvania state university university park pa", "city": null, "Name": "thomas la porta"}]}, "Article No.: 19": {"references": ["Gediminas Adomavicius , Alexander Tuzhilin, Toward the Next Generation of Recommender Systems: A Survey of the State-of-the-Art and Possible Extensions, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, v.17 n.6, p.734-749, June 2005[doi>10.1109/TKDE.2005.99]\n", "Jie Bao , Yu Zheng , Mohamed F.

Most of the existing recommendation models do not consider the spatial information of users or items; however, LA-LDA supports three classes of location-based ratings, namely spatial user ratings for nonspatial items, nonspatial user ratings for spatial items, and spatial user ratings for spatial items. LA-LDA consists of two components, ULA-LDA and ILA-LDA, which are designed to take into account user and item location information, respectively. The component ULA-LDA explicitly incorporates and quantifies the influence from local public preferences to produce recommendations by considering user home locations, whereas the component ILA-LDA recommends items that are closer in both taste and travel distance to the querying users by capturing item co-occurrence patterns, as well as item location co-occurrence patterns. The two components of LA-LDA can be applied either separately or collectively, depending on the available types of location-based ratings. To demonstrate the applicability and flexibility of the LA-LDA model, we deploy it to both top-krecommendation and cold start recommendation scenarios. Experimental evidence on large-scale real-world data, including the data from Gowalla (a location-based social network), DoubanEvent (an event-based social network), and MovieLens (a movie recommendation system), reveal that LA-LDA models user profiles more accurately by outperforming existing recommendation models for top-krecommendation and the cold start problem.", "authors": [{"name": "hongzhi yin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81501665075"}, {"name": "bin cui", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100229109"}, {"name": "ling chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81408598820"}, {"name": "zhiting hu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82659069557"}, {"name": "chengqi zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548914356"}], "title": "Modeling Location-Based User Rating Profiles for Personalized Recommendation", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "553\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "54\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "553\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "australia", "university": "university of queensland", "affiliation_string": "university of queensland qld australia", "city": "brisbane", "Name": "hongzhi yin"}, {"country": "china", "university": "peking university", "affiliation_string": "peking university beijing china", "city": "peking", "Name": "bin cui"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "university of technology sydney", "affiliation_string": "university of technology sydney", "city": "sydney", "Name": "ling chen"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university", "city": null, "Name": "zhiting hu"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "university of technology sydney", "affiliation_string": "university of technology sydney", "city": "sydney", "Name": "chengqi zhang"}]}, "Article No.: 25": {"references": ["Aris Anagnostopoulos, Ravi Kumar, and Mohammad Mahdian. 2008.

Particularly, we consider users\u2019 (re)tweet behaviors and focus on investigating how friends in one\u2019s ego network influence retweet behaviors. We propose a novel notion ofsocial influence localityand develop two instantiation functions based on pairwise influence and structural diversity. The defined influence locality functions have strong predictive power. Without any additional features, we can obtain an F1-score of 71.65&percnt; for predicting users\u2019 retweet behaviors by training a logistic regression classifier based on the defined influence locality functions. We incorporate social influence locality into a factor graph model, which can further leverage the network-based correlation. Our experiments on the large microblogging network show that the model significantly improves the precision of retweet prediction. Our analysis also reveals several intriguing discoveries. For example, if you have six friends retweeting a microblog, the average likelihood that you will also retweet it strongly depends on the structure among the six friends: The likelihood will significantly drop (only &frac16;) when the six friends do not know each other, compared with the case when the six friends know each other.", "authors": [{"name": "jing zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82659020457"}, {"name": "jie tang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350588685"}, {"name": "juanzi li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81553343956"}, {"name": "yang liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658703024"}, {"name": "chunxiao xing", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658705055"}], "title": "Who Influenced You?

Typical studies of distance metric learning evaluate how to construct an appropriate distance metric that is able to separate training data points from different classes or satisfy a set of constraints (e.g., must-links and/or cannot-links). It is noteworthy that this task becomes challenging when there are only limited labeled training data points and no constraints are given explicitly. Moreover, most existing approaches aim to construct a global distance metric that is applicable to all data points. However, different data points may have different properties and may require different distance metrics. We notice that data points in real tasks are often connected by physical links (e.g., people are linked with each other in social networks; personal webpages are often connected to other webpages, including nonpersonal webpages), but the linkage information has not been exploited in distance metric learning. In this article, we develop a pairwised specific distance (PSD) approach that exploits the structures of physical linkages and in particular captures the key observations that nonmetric and clique linkages imply the appearance of different or unique semantics, respectively. It is noteworthy that, rather than generating a global distance, PSD generates different distances for different pairs of data points; this property is desired in applications involving complicated data semantics. We mainly present PSD for multi-class learning and further extend it to multi-label learning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of PSD, especially in the scenarios in which there are very limited labeled training data points and no explicit constraints are given.", "authors": [{"name": "juhua hu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658706037"}, {"name": "de-chuan zhan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435595808"}, {"name": "xintao wu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658701474"}, {"name": "yuan jiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81342498815"}, {"name": "zhi-hua zhou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451593001"}], "title": "Pairwised Specific Distance Learning from Physical Linkages", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "116\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "116\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "china", "university": "nanjing university", "affiliation_string": "nanjing university nanjing china", "city": "nanjing", "Name": "juhua hu"}, {"country": "china", "university": "nanjing university", "affiliation_string": "nanjing university nanjing china", "city": "nanjing", "Name": "de-chuan zhan"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of arkansas fayetteville ar", "city": null, "Name": "xintao wu"}, {"country": "china", "university": "nanjing university", "affiliation_string": "nanjing university nanjing china", "city": "nanjing", "Name": "yuan jiang"}, {"country": "china", "university": "nanjing university", "affiliation_string": "nanjing university nanjing china", "city": "nanjing", "Name": "zhi-hua zhou"}]}, "Article No.: 24": {"references": ["Leman Akoglu , Pedro O.

Today, millions of people carrying smartphones or tablets are able to communicate practically any time and anywhere they want. They can access their e-mails, comment on weblogs, watch and post videos and photos (as well as comment on them), and make phone calls or text messages almost ubiquitously. Given this scenario, in this article, we tackle a fundamental aspect of this new era of communication: How the time intervals between communication events behave for different technologies and means of communications. Are there universal patterns for the Inter-Event Time Distribution (IED)&quest; How do inter-event times behave differently among particular technologies&quest; To answer these questions, we analyzed eight different datasets from real and modern communication data and found four well-defined patterns seen in all the eight datasets. Moreover, we propose the use of the Self-Feeding Process (SFP) to generate inter-event times between communications. The SFP is an extremely parsimonious point process that requires at most two parameters and is able to generate inter-event times with all the universal properties we observed in the data. We also show three potential applications of the SFP: as a framework to generate a synthetic dataset containing realistic communication events of any one of the analyzed means of communications, as a technique to detect anomalies, and as a building block for more specific models that aim to encompass the particularities seen in each of the analyzed systems.", "authors": [{"name": "pedro o s vaz de melo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658661405"}, {"name": "christos faloutsos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100373169"}, {"name": "renato assuncao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81416609306"}, {"name": "rodrigo alves", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658702674"}, {"name": "antonio a f loureiro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100219450"}], "title": "Universal and Distinct Properties of Communication Dynamics: How to Generate Realistic Inter-event Times", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "94\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "94\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "brazil", "university": "universidade federal de minas gerais", "affiliation_string": "universidade federal de minas gerais belo horizonte mg brazil", "city": "belo horizonte", "Name": "pedro o s vaz de melo"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa united states of america", "city": "united states", "Name": "christos faloutsos"}, {"country": "brazil", "university": "universidade federal de minas gerais", "affiliation_string": "universidade federal de minas gerais belo horizonte mg brazil", "city": "belo horizonte", "Name": "renato assuncao"}, {"country": "brazil", "university": "universidade federal de minas gerais", "affiliation_string": "universidade federal de minas gerais belo horizonte mg brazil", "city": "belo horizonte", "Name": "rodrigo alves"}, {"country": "brazil", "university": "universidade federal de minas gerais", "affiliation_string": "universidade federal de minas gerais belo horizonte mg brazil", "city": "belo horizonte", "Name": "antonio a f loureiro"}]}, "Article No.: 17": {"references": ["Naoki Abe , Bianca Zadrozny , John Langford, Outlier detection by active learning, Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining, August 20-23, 2006, Philadelphia, PA, USA[doi>10.1145/1150402.1150459]\n", "Peter L.

Under the ERM principle, one minimizes an upper bound of the true risk, which is approximated by the summation of empirical risk and the complexity of the candidate classifier class. To guarantee a satisfactory learning performance, ERM requires that the training data are i.i.d. sampled from the unknown source distribution. However, this may not be the case in active learning, where one selects the most informative samples to label, and these data may not follow the source distribution. In this article, we generalize the ERM principle to the active learning setting. We derive a novel form of upper bound for the true risk in the active learning setting; by minimizing this upper bound, we develop a practical batch mode active learning method. The proposed formulation involves a nonconvex integer programming optimization problem. We solve it efficiently by an alternating optimization method. Our method is shown to query the most informative samples while preserving the source distribution as much as possible, thus identifying the most uncertain and representative queries. We further extend our method to multiclass active learning by introducing novel pseudolabels in the multiclass case and developing an efficient algorithm. Experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world applications demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "authors": [{"name": "zheng wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474674324"}, {"name": "jieping ye", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100042425"}], "title": "Querying Discriminative and Representative Samples for Batch Mode Active Learning", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "168\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "20\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "202\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Grenada", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "arizona state university tempe az", "city": "tempe", "Name": "zheng wang"}, {"country": "Grenada", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "arizona state university tempe az", "city": "tempe", "Name": "jieping ye"}]}, "Article No.: 21": {"references": ["Bruno Abrahao, Sucheta Soundarajan, John Hopcroft, and Robert Kleinberg. 2012.

Such efforts are complicated by a lack of consensus on what a \u201ccommunity\u201d truly is, and these disagreements have led to a wide variety of mathematical formulations for describing communities. Often, these mathematical formulations, such as modularity and conductance, have been founded in the general principle that communities, like aG(n,p) graph, are \u201cround,\u201d with connections throughout the entire community, and so algorithms were developed to optimize such mathematical measures. More recently, a variety of algorithms have been developed that, rather than expecting connectivity through the entire community, seek out very small groups of well-connected nodes and then connect these groups into larger communities. In this article, we examine seven real networks, each containing external annotation that allows us to identify \u201cannotated communities.\u201d A study of these annotated communities gives insight into why the second category of community detection algorithms may be more successful than the first category. We then present a flexible algorithm template that is based on the idea of joining together small sets of nodes. In this template, we first identify very small, tightly connected \u201csubcommunities\u201d of nodes, each corresponding to a single node\u2019s \u201cperception\u201d of the network around it. We then create a new network in which each node represents such a subcommunity, and then identify communities in this new network.

This plays an important role in understanding mobile user behaviors and thus provides the opportunity for the development of better intelligent context-aware services. A key step of context recognition is to model the personalized contextual information of mobile users. Although many studies have been devoted to mobile context modeling, limited efforts have been made on the exploitation of the sequential and dependency characteristics of mobile contextual information. Also, the latent semantics behind mobile context are often ambiguous and poorly understood. Indeed, a promising direction is to incorporate some domain knowledge of common contexts, such as \u201cwaiting for a bus\u201d or \u201chaving dinner,\u201d by modeling both labeled and unlabeled context data from mobile users because there are often few labeled contexts available in practice. To this end, in this article, we propose a sequence-based semisupervised approach to modeling personalized context for mobile users. Specifically, we first exploit the Bayesian Hidden Markov Model (B-HMM) for modeling context in the form of probabilistic distributions and transitions of raw context data. Also, we propose a sequential model by extending B-HMM with the prior knowledge of contextual features to model context more accurately. Then, to efficiently learn the parameters and initial values of the proposed models, we develop a novel approach for parameter estimation by integrating the Dirichlet Process Mixture (DPM) model and the Mixture Unigram (MU) model. Furthermore, by incorporating both user-labeled and unlabeled data, we propose a semisupervised learning-based algorithm to identify and model the latent semantics of context. Finally, experimental results on real-world data clearly validate both the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approaches for recognizing personalized context of mobile users.", "authors": [{"name": "baoxing huai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658640934"}, {"name": "enhong chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323488612"}, {"name": "hengshu zhu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490670832"}, {"name": "hui xiong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451596433"}, {"name": "tengfei bao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81472651290"}, {"name": "qi liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83358683257"}, {"name": "jilei tian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81440597994"}], "title": "Toward Personalized Context Recognition for Mobile Users: A Semisupervised Bayesian HMM Approach", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "153\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "22\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "309\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "university of science and technology of china hefei anhui china", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "baoxing huai"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "university of science and technology of china hefei anhui china", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "enhong chen"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "university of science and technology of china hefei anhui china", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "hengshu zhu"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "rutgers university newark usa", "city": "newark", "Name": "hui xiong"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "university of science and technology of china", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "tengfei bao"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "university of science and technology of china", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "qi liu"}, {"country": "China", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "nokia beijing china", "city": "beijing", "Name": "jilei tian"}]}, "Article No.: 12": {"references": ["Nitin Agarwal , Huan Liu , Lei Tang , Philip S.

When users share information (e.g., data and photos) with friends, they can make their friends vulnerable to security and privacy breaches with dire consequences. With the continuous expansion of a user\u2019s social network, privacy settings alone are often inadequate to protect a user\u2019s profile. In this research, we aim to address some critical issues related to privacy protection: (1) How can we measure and assess individual users\u2019 vulnerability&quest; (2) With the diversity of one\u2019s social network friends, how can one figure out an effective approach to maintaining balance between vulnerability and social utility&quest; In this work, first we present a novel way to define vulnerable friends from an individual user\u2019s perspective. User vulnerability is dependent on whether or not the user\u2019s friends\u2019 privacy settings protect the friend and the individual\u2019s network of friends (which includes the user). We show that it is feasible to measure and assess user vulnerability and reduce one\u2019s vulnerability without changing the structure of a social networking site. The approach is to unfriend one\u2019s most vulnerable friends. However, when such a vulnerable friend is also socially important, unfriending him or her would significantly reduce one\u2019s own social status. We formulate this novel problem as vulnerability minimization with social utility constraints. We formally define the optimization problem and provide an approximation algorithm with a proven bound. Finally, we conduct a large-scale evaluation of a new framework using a Facebook dataset. We resort to experiments and observe how much vulnerability an individual user can be decreased by unfriending a vulnerable friend. We compare performance of different unfriending strategies and discuss the security risk of new friend requests. Additionally, by employing different forms of social utility, we confirm that the balance between user vulnerability and social utility can be practically achieved.", "authors": [{"name": "pritam gundecha", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81488671045"}, {"name": "geoffrey barbier", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81482653335"}, {"name": "jiliang tang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81496640622"}, {"name": "huan liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367594306"}], "title": "User Vulnerability and Its Reduction on a Social Networking Site", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "244\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "33\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "491\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Grenada", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "arizona state university tempe az", "city": "tempe", "Name": "pritam gundecha"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "air force research laboratory wright-patterson air force base oh", "city": null, "Name": "geoffrey barbier"}, {"country": "Grenada", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "arizona state university tempe az", "city": "tempe", "Name": "jiliang tang"}, {"country": "Grenada", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "arizona state university tempe az", "city": "tempe", "Name": "huan liu"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["Rakesh Agrawal , Tomasz Imieli\u0144ski , Arun Swami, Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases, Proceedings of the 1993 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data, p.207-216, May 25-28, 1993, Washington, D.C., USA[doi>10.1145/170035.170072]\n", "A.

In this article, we study the problem of population anomaly detection, one of the key issues related to event monitoring and population management within a city. Through studying detected population anomalies, we can trace and analyze these anomalies, which could help to model city traffic design and event impact analysis and prediction. Although a significant and interesting issue, it is very hard to detect population anomalies and retrieve anomaly trajectories, especially given that it is difficult to get actual and sufficient population data. To address the difficulties of a lack of real population data, we take advantage of mobile phone networks, which offer enormous spatial and temporal communication data on persons. More importantly, we claim that we can utilize these mobile phone data to infer and approximate population data. Thus, we can study the population anomaly detection problem by taking advantages of unique features hidden in mobile phone data. In this article, we present a system to conduct Population Anomaly Detection (PAD). First, we propose an effective clustering method,correlation-based clustering, to cluster the incomplete location information from mobile phone data (i.e., from mobile call volume distribution to population density distribution). Then, we design an adaptive parameter-free detection method,R-scan, to capture the distributed dynamic anomalies. Finally, we devise an efficient algorithm,BT-miner, to retrieveanomaly trajectories. The experimental results from real-life mobile phone data confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms. Finally, the proposed methods are realized as a pilot system in a city in China.", "authors": [{"name": "siyuan liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81496643175"}, {"name": "lei chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474692618"}, {"name": "lionel m ni", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548023289"}], "title": "Anomaly Detection from Incomplete Data", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "248\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "16\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "646\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university", "city": null, "Name": "siyuan liu"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "hong kong university of science and technology", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "lei chen"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "hong kong university of science and technology", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "lionel m ni"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["A.

Inspired by contemporary physics theory (i.e., heat diffusion and quantum mechanics), we propose two unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms. Building on the embedding manifold derived from heat diffusion, we devise Local Anomaly Descriptor (LAD), which faithfully reveals the intrinsic neighborhood density. It uses a scale-dependent umbrella operator to bridge global and local properties, which makes LAD more informative within an adaptive scope of neighborhood. To offer more stability of local density measurement on scaling parameter tuning, we formulate Fermi Density Descriptor (FDD), which measures the probability of a fermion particle being at a specific location. By choosing the stable energy distribution function, FDD steadily distinguishes anomalies from normal instances with any scaling parameter setting. To further enhance the efficacy of our proposed algorithms, we explore the utility of anisotropic Gaussian kernel (AGK), which offers better manifold-aware affinity information. We also quantify and examine the effect of different Laplacian normalizations for anomaly detection. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and benchmark datasets verify that our proposed algorithms outperform the existing anomaly detection algorithms.", "authors": [{"name": "hao huang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81496654701"}, {"name": "hong qin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100550215"}, {"name": "shinjae yoo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436598883"}, {"name": "dantong yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100471739"}], "title": "Physics-Based Anomaly Detection Defined on Manifold Space", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "121\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "15\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "271\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "computer science department stony brook university stony brook ny usa", "city": null, "Name": "hao huang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "computer science department stony brook university stony brook ny usa", "city": null, "Name": "hong qin"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "computational science center brookhaven national laboratory upton ny", "city": null, "Name": "shinjae yoo"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "computational science center brookhaven national laboratory upton ny", "city": null, "Name": "dantong yu"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["E.

Over the past few years, many ensemble clustering approaches have been developed. However, most of them are designed for partitional clustering methods, and few research efforts have been reported for ensemble hierarchical clustering methods. In this article, a hierarchical ensemble clustering framework that can naturally combine both partitional clustering and hierarchical clustering results is proposed. In addition, a novel method for learning the ultra-metric distance from the aggregated distance matrices and generating final hierarchical clustering with enhanced cluster separation is developed based on the ultra-metric distance for hierarchical clustering. We study three important problems: dendrogram description, dendrogram combination, and dendrogram selection. We develop two approaches for dendrogram selection based on tree distances, and we investigate various dendrogram distances for representing dendrograms. We provide a systematic empirical study of the ensemble hierarchical clustering problem.

For example, in bioinformatics, jointly mining multiple gene expression datasets obtained by different labs or during various biological processes may overcome the heavy noise in the data. Moreover, by joint mining of gene expression data and protein-protein interaction data, we may discover clusters of genes which show coherent expression patterns and also produce interacting proteins. Such clusters may be potential pathways.In this article, we investigate a novel data mining problem,mining frequent cross-graph quasi-cliques, which is generalized from several interesting applications in bioinformatics, cross-market customer segmentation, social network analysis, and Web mining. In a graph, a set of verticesSis a \u03b3-quasi-clique (0 < \u03b3 \u2264 1) if each vertexvinSdirectly connects to at least \u03b3 \u22c5 (&verbar;S&verbar; \u2212 1) other vertices inS. Given a set of graphsG1, \u2026,Gnand parametermin_sup(0 <min_sup\u2264 1), a set of verticesSis a frequent cross-graph quasi-clique ifSis a \u03b3-quasi-clique in at leastmin_sup\u22c5ngraphs, and there does not exist a proper superset ofShaving the property.We build a general model, show why the complete set of frequent cross-graph quasi-cliques cannot be found by previous data mining methods, and study the complexity of the problem. While the problem is difficult, we develop practical algorithms which exploit several interesting and effective techniques and heuristics to efficaciously mine frequent cross-graph quasi-cliques. A systematic performance study is reported on both synthetic and real data sets. We demonstrate some interesting and meaningful frequent cross-graph quasi-cliques in bioinformatics. The experimental results also show that our algorithms are efficient and scalable.", "authors": [{"name": "daxin jiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452599802"}, {"name": "jian pei", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100323054"}], "title": "Mining frequent cross-graph quasi-cliques", "citations": [{"Name": "Arlei Silva ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wagner Meira", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jr. ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mohammed J.

In this article, we present a study on combining game theory and data mining by introducing the concept of domination game analysis. We present a multidimensional market model, where every dimension represents one attribute of a commodity. Every product or customer is represented by a point in the multidimensional space, and a product is said to \u201cdominate\u201d a customer if all of its attributes can satisfy the requirements of the customer. The expected market share of a product is measured by the expected number of the buyers in the customers, all of which are equally likely to buy any product dominating him. A Nash equilibrium is a configuration of the products achieving stable expected market shares for all products. We prove that Nash equilibrium in such a model can be computed in polynomial time if every manufacturer tries to modify its product in a round robin manner. To further improve the efficiency of the computation, we also design two algorithms for the manufacturers to efficiently find their best response to other products in the market.", "authors": [{"name": "zhenjie zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100116075"}, {"name": "laks v s lakshmanan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452610814"}, {"name": "anthony k h tung", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100486586"}], "title": "On domination game analysis for microeconomic data mining", "citations": [{"Name": "Silei Xu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "John Chi-Shing Lui", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Silei Xu ", "Country": "denmark", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yishi Lin ", "Country": "denmark", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hong Xie ", "Country": "denmark", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "John C.

Cluster ensembles can provide robust and stable solutions by leveraging the consensus across multiple clustering results, while averaging out emergent spurious structures that arise due to the various biases to which each participating algorithm is tuned. In this article, we address the problem of combining multipleweighted clustersthat belong to different subspaces of the input space. We leverage the diversity of the input clusterings in order to generate a consensus partition that is superior to the participating ones. Since we are dealing with weighted clusters, our consensus functions make use of the weight vectors associated with the clusters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques by running experiments with several real datasets, including high-dimensional text data. Furthermore, we investigate in depth the issue of diversity and accuracy for our ensemble methods. Our analysis and experimental results show that the proposed techniques are capable of producing a partition that is as good as or better than the best individual clustering.", "authors": [{"name": "carlotta domeniconi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100062921"}, {"name": "muna al-razgan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81325487587"}], "title": "Weighted cluster ensembles: Methods and analysis", "citations": [{"Name": "Jo\u00e3o M.

The sampling quality we consider refers to the degree of consistency between the sample proportion and the population proportion of each attribute value in a window. Due to the time-variant nature of real-world datasets, users are more likely to be interested in the most recent data. However, previous works have not been able to generate a high-quality sample over sliding windows that precisely preserves up-to-date population characteristics. Motivated by this shortcoming, we have developed theFPSalgorithm, which has several advantages: (1) it sequentially generates a sample from a time-variant data source over sliding windows; (2) the execution time ofFPSis linear with respect to the database size; (3) therelativeproportional differences between the sample proportions and population proportions of most distinct attribute values are guaranteed to be below a specified error threshold, &epsiv;, while therelativeproportion differences of the remaining attribute values are as close to &epsiv; as possible, which ensures that the generated sample is of high quality; (4) the sample rate is close to the user specified rate so that a high quality sampling result can be obtained without increasing the sample size; (5) by a thorough analytical and empirical study, we prove thatFPShas acceptable space overheads, especially when the attribute values have Zipfian distributions, andFPScan also excellently preserve the population proportion of multivariate features in the sample; and (6)FPScan be applied to infinite streams and finite datasets equally, and the generated samples can be used for various applications. Our experiments on both real and synthetic data validate thatFPScan effectively obtain a high quality sample of the desired size. In addition, while using the sample generated byFPSin various mining applications, a significant improvement in efficiency can be achieved without compromising the model's precision.", "authors": [{"name": "kun-ta chuang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100637068"}, {"name": "hung-leng chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81392608407"}, {"name": "ming-syan chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81450594725"}], "title": "Feature-preserved sampling over streaming data", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "33\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "722\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "taiwan", "university": "national taiwan university", "affiliation_string": "national taiwan university taipei taiwan", "city": "taibei", "Name": "kun-ta chuang"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "national taiwan university", "affiliation_string": "national taiwan university taipei taiwan", "city": "taibei", "Name": "hung-leng chen"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "national taiwan university", "affiliation_string": "national taiwan university taipei taiwan", "city": "taibei", "Name": "ming-syan chen"}]}}, "date": {"month": "January", "year": "2009"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Eugene Agichtein , Luis Gravano,Snowball: extracting relations from large plain-text collections, Proceedings of the fifth ACM conference on Digital libraries, p.85-94, June 02-07, 2000, San Antonio, Texas, USA[doi>10.1145/336597.336644]\n", "Agichtein, E. and Gravano, L. 2003.

In this paper we present techniques to automatically discover relations between biomedical resources from the Web. For this purpose we retrieve relevant information from Web Search engines and Pubmed database using various lexico-syntactic patterns as queries over SOAP web services. The patterns are initially handcrafted but can be progressively learnt. The extracted relations can be used to construct and augment ontologies and knowledge bases.

As more and more categories of datasets come online, there is a corresponding multitude of ways in which inferences can be chained across them, motivating the need for compositional data mining algorithms. In this article, we argue that such compositional data mining can be effectively realized by functionally cascading redescription mining and biclustering algorithms as primitives. Both these primitives mirror shifts of vocabulary that can be composed in arbitrary ways to create rich chains of inferences. Given a relational database and its schema, we show how the schema can be automatically compiled into a compositional data mining program, and how different domains in the schema can be related through logical sequences of biclustering and redescription invocations. This feature allows us to rapidly prototype new data mining applications, yielding greater understanding of scientific datasets.

However, the curse of dimensionality plagues effort to analyze these high throughput data. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Biased Discriminant Analysis (BDA) are two popular techniques for dimension reduction, which pay attention to different roles of the positive and negative samples in finding discriminating subspace. However, the drawbacks of these two methods are obvious: LDA has limited efficiency in classifying sample data from subclasses with different distributions, and BDA does not account for the underlying distribution of negative samples.In this paper, we propose a novel dimension reduction technique for microarray analysis: Adaptive Discriminant Analysis (ADA), which effectively exploits favorable attributes of both BDA and LDA and avoids their unfavorable ones. ADA can find a good discriminative subspace with adaptation to different sample distributions. It not only alleviates the problem of high dimensionality, but also enhances the classification performance in the subspace with na\u00efve Bayes classifier. To learn the best model fitting the real scenario, boosted Adaptive Discriminant Analysis is further proposed. Extensive experiments on the yeast cell cycle regulation data set, and the expression data of the red blood cell cycle in malaria parasitePlasmodium falciparumdemonstrate the superior performance of ADA and boosted ADA. We also present some putative genes of specific functional classes predicted by boosted ADA. Their potential functionality is confirmed by independent predictions based on Gene Ontology, demonstrating that ADA and boosted ADA are effective dimension reduction methods for microarray-based classification.", "authors": [{"name": "yijuan lu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330494235"}, {"name": "qi tian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81423592672"}, {"name": "jennifer neary", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339519580"}, {"name": "feng liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332513129"}, {"name": "yufeng wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332534218"}], "title": "Adaptive discriminant analysis for microarray-based classification", "citations": [{"Name": "Suk Jin Lee ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yuichi Motai ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Elisabeth Weiss ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shumei S.

Recently, complex and unstructured (or semi-structured) datasets have appeared as targets for major data mining applications, including text mining, web mining and bioinformatics. Our work focuses on labeled ordered trees, which are typically semi-structured datasets. In bioinformatics, carbohydrate sugar chains, or glycans, can be modeled as labeled ordered trees. Glycans are the third major class of biomolecules, having important roles in signaling and recognition. For mining labeled ordered trees, we propose a new probabilistic model and its efficient learning scheme which significantly improves the time and space complexity of an existing probabilistic model for labeled ordered trees. We evaluated the performance of the proposed model, comparing it with those of other probabilistic models, using synthetic as well as real datasets from glycobiology. Experimental results showed that the proposed model drastically reduced the computation time of the competing model, keeping the predictive power and avoiding overfitting to the training data. Finally, we assessed our results on real data from a variety of biological viewpoints, verifying known facts in glycobiology.", "authors": [{"name": "kosuke hashimoto", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81317488329"}, {"name": "kiyoko flora aoki-kinoshita", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100014823"}, {"name": "nobuhisa ueda", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100364192"}, {"name": "minoru kanehisa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100471898"}, {"name": "hiroshi mamitsuka", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100594140"}], "title": "A new efficient probabilistic model for mining labeled ordered trees applied to glycobiology", "citations": [{"Name": "Albert Bifet", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Adaptive Stream Mining: Pattern Learning and Mining from Evolving Data Streams", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "33\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "624\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "japan", "university": "kyoto university", "affiliation_string": "institute for chemical research kyoto university japan", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "kosuke hashimoto"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "kyoto university", "affiliation_string": "institute for chemical research kyoto university japan", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "kiyoko flora aoki-kinoshita"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "kyoto university", "affiliation_string": "institute for chemical research kyoto university japan", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "nobuhisa ueda"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "kyoto university", "affiliation_string": "institute for chemical research kyoto university japan", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "minoru kanehisa"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "kyoto university", "affiliation_string": "institute for chemical research kyoto university japan", "city": "kyoto", "Name": "hiroshi mamitsuka"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Peter N.

Images of aDrosophila melanogasterembryo at a given developmental stage, showing a particular gene expression pattern revealed by a gene-specific probe, can be compared for spatial overlaps. The comparison is fundamentally important to formulating and testing gene interaction hypotheses. Expression pattern comparison is most biologically meaningful when images from a similar time point (developmental stage) are compared. In this paper, we present LdaPath, a novel formulation of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for automatic developmental stage range classification. It employs multivariate linear regression with theL1-norm penalty controlled by a regularization parameter for feature extraction and visualization. LdaPath computes an entire solution path for all values of regularization parameter with essentially the same computational cost as fitting one LDA model. Thus, it facilitates efficient model selection. It is based on the equivalence relationship between LDA and the least squares method for multiclass classifications. This equivalence relationship is established under a mild condition, which we show empirically to hold for many high-dimensional datasets, such as expression pattern images. Our experiments on a collection of 2705 expression pattern images show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Results also show that the LDA model resulting from LdaPath is sparse, and irrelevant features may be removed. Thus, LdaPath provides a general framework for simultaneous feature selection and feature extraction.", "authors": [{"name": "jieping ye", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100042425"}, {"name": "jianhui chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81343489892"}, {"name": "ravi janardan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100533794"}, {"name": "sudhir kumar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350571256"}], "title": "Developmental stage annotation of Drosophila gene expression pattern images via an entire solution path for LDA", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "22\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "637\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Grenada", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "arizona state university tempe az", "city": "tempe", "Name": "jieping ye"}, {"country": "Grenada", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "arizona state university tempe az", "city": "tempe", "Name": "jianhui chen"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of minnesota minneapolis mn", "city": "minneapolis", "Name": "ravi janardan"}, {"country": "Grenada", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "arizona state university tempe az", "city": "tempe", "Name": "sudhir kumar"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2008"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Charu C.

However, they have only two orders (i.e., matrices, like author and keyword in the previous example).We propose to envision such higher-order data as tensors, and tap the vast literature on the topic. However, these methods do not necessarily scale up, let alone operate on semi-infinite streams. Thus, we introduce a general framework, incremental tensor analysis (ITA), which efficiently computes a compact summary for high-order and high-dimensional data, and also reveals the hidden correlations. Three variants of ITA are presented: (1) dynamic tensor analysis (DTA); (2) streaming tensor analysis (STA); and (3) window-based tensor analysis (WTA). In paricular, we explore several fundamental design trade-offs such as space efficiency, computational cost, approximation accuracy, time dependency, and model complexity.We implement all our methods and apply them in several real settings, such as network anomaly detection, multiway latent semantic indexing on citation networks, and correlation study on sensor measurements.

Among the various methods employed for \u201csanitizing\u201d the data prior to disclosure, we focus in this article on anonymization, given its widespread use in practice. We do due diligence to the question \u201cjust how safe is the anonymized data&quest;\u201d We consider both those scenarios when the hacker has no information and, more realistically, when the hacker may have partial information about items in the domain. We conduct our analyses in the context of frequent set mining and address the safety question at two different levels: (i) how likely of being cracked (i.e., re-identified by a hacker), are the identities of individual items and (ii) how likely are sets of items cracked&quest; For capturing the prior knowledge of the hacker, we propose abelief function, which amounts to an educated guess of the frequency of each item. For various classes of belief functions which correspond to different degrees of prior knowledge, we derive formulas for computing the expected number of cracks of single items and for itemsets, the probability of cracking the itemsets. While obtaining, exact values for more general situations is computationally hard, we propose a series of heuristics called theO-estimates. They are easy to compute and are shown fairly accurate, justified by empirical results on real benchmark datasets. Based on the O-estimates, we propose a recipe for the decision makers to resolve their dilemma. Our recipe operates at two different levels, depending on whether the data owner wants to reason in terms of single items or sets of items (or both). Finally, we present techniques for ascertaining a hacker's knowledge of correlation in terms of co-occurrence of items likely. This information regarding the hacker's knowledge can be incorporated into our framework of disclosure risk analysis and we present experimental results demonstrating how this knowledge affects the heuristic estimates we have developed.", "authors": [{"name": "laks v s lakshmanan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452610814"}, {"name": "raymond t ng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100471422"}, {"name": "ganesh ramesh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100266533"}], "title": "On disclosure risk analysis of anonymized itemsets in the presence of prior knowledge", "citations": [{"Name": "Dinusha Vatsalan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Peter Christen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Vassilios S.

However, in many applications only a small subset of the available data is relevant for the problem and the rest needs to be ignored in order to obtain good clusters. Certain nonparametric density-based clustering methods find the most relevant data as multiple dense regions, but such methods are generally limited to low-dimensional data and do not scale well to large, high-dimensional datasets. Also, they use a specific notion of \u201cdistance\u201d, typically Euclidean or Mahalanobis distance, which further limits their applicability. On the other hand, the recent One Class Information Bottleneck (OC-IB) method is fast and works on a large class of distortion measures known as Bregman Divergences, but can only find asingledense region. This article presents a broad framework for findingkdense clusters while ignoring the rest of the data. It includes a seeding algorithm that can automatically determine a suitable value fork. Whenkis forced to 1, our method gives rise to an improved version of OC-IB with optimality guarantees. We provide a generative model that yields the proposed iterative algorithm for findingkdense regions as a special case. Our analysis reveals an interesting and novel connection between the problem of finding dense regions and exponential mixture models; a hard model corresponding tokexponential mixtures with a uniform background results in a set ofkdense clusters. The proposed method describes a highly scalable algorithm for finding multiple dense regions that works with any Bregman Divergence, thus extending density based clustering to a variety of non-Euclidean problems not addressable by earlier methods. We present empirical results on three artificial, two microarray and one text dataset to show the relevance and effectiveness of our methods.", "authors": [{"name": "gunjan gupta", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331493603"}, {"name": "joydeep ghosh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100558602"}], "title": "Bregman bubble clustering: A robust framework for mining dense clusters", "citations": [{"Name": "Yun Xiong ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yangyong Zhu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Philip S.

While attribute data have been the main source of data for cluster analysis, relationship data such as social networks or metabolic networks are becoming increasingly available. It is also common to observe both data types carry complementary information such as in market segmentation and community identification, which calls for a joint cluster analysis of both data types so as to achieve better results. In this article, we introduce the novel Connectedk-Center (CkC) problem, a clustering model taking into account attribute data as well as relationship data. We analyze the complexity of the problem and prove its NP-hardness. Therefore, we analyze the approximability of the problem and also present a constant factor approximation algorithm. For the special case of theCkCproblem where the relationship data form a tree structure, we propose a dynamic programming method giving an optimal solution in polynomial time. We further present NetScan, a heuristic algorithm that is efficient and effective for large real databases. Our extensive experimental evaluation on real datasets demonstrates the meaningfulness and accuracy of the NetScan results.", "authors": [{"name": "rong ge", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100075610"}, {"name": "martin ester", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100382875"}, {"name": "byron j gao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81536545556"}, {"name": "zengjian hu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81317494612"}, {"name": "binay bhattacharya", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409591733"}, {"name": "boaz ben-moshe", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329487687"}], "title": "Joint cluster analysis of attribute data and relationship data: The connectedk-center problem, algorithms and applications", "citations": [{"Name": "Arlei Silva ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wagner Meira", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jr. ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mohammed J.

Mining frequent patterns from XML documents can be recast as mining frequent tree structures from a database of XML documents. In this study, we model a database of XML documents as a database of rooted labeled ordered subtrees. In particular, we are mainly concerned with mining frequent induced and embedded ordered subtrees. Our main contributions are as follows. We describe our uniqueembedding listrepresentation of the tree structure, which enables efficient implementation of ourTree Model Guided(TMG) candidate generation.TMGis an optimal, nonredundant enumeration strategy that enumerates all the valid candidates that conform to the structural aspects of the data. We show through a mathematical model and experiments thatTMGhas better complexity compared to the commonly used join approach. In this article, we propose two algorithms, MB3-Miner and iMB3-Miner. MB3-Miner mines embedded subtrees. iMB3-Miner mines induced and/or embedded subtrees by using themaximum level of embedding constraint. Our experiments with both synthetic and real datasets against two well-known algorithms for mining induced and embedded subtrees, demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed techniques.", "authors": [{"name": "henry tan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331505384"}, {"name": "fedja hadzic", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331493412"}, {"name": "tharam s dillon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100024544"}, {"name": "elizabeth chang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100247925"}, {"name": "ling feng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100140676"}], "title": "Tree model guided candidate generation for mining frequent subtrees from XML documents", "citations": [{"Name": "Fedja Hadzic ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Henry Tan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tharam S.

The explosive popularity of social media produces massive and high-dimensional data at an unprecedented rate, presenting new challenges to feature selection. Social media data consists of (1) traditional high-dimensional, attribute-value data such as posts, tweets, comments, and images, and (2) linked data that provides social context for posts and describes the relationships between social media users as well as who generates the posts, and so on. The nature of social media also determines that its data is massive, noisy, and incomplete, which exacerbates the already challenging problem of feature selection. In this article, we study a novel feature selection problem of selecting features for social media data with its social context. In detail, we illustrate the differences between attribute-value data and social media data, investigate if linked data can be exploited in a new feature selection framework by taking advantage of social science theories. We design and conduct experiments on datasets from real-world social media Web sites, and the empirical results demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly improve the performance of feature selection. Further experiments are conducted to evaluate the effects of user--user and user--post relationships manifested in linked data on feature selection, and research issues for future work will be discussed.", "authors": [{"name": "jiliang tang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81496640622"}, {"name": "huan liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367594306"}], "title": "Feature Selection for Social Media Data", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "181\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "22\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "390\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Grenada", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "arizona state university tempe az", "city": "tempe", "Name": "jiliang tang"}, {"country": "Grenada", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "arizona state university tempe az", "city": "tempe", "Name": "huan liu"}]}, "Article No.: 23": {"references": ["Ricardo Baeza-Yates and Berthier Ribeiro-Neto. 2011.

If we only know the number of common words for every pair of documents, as well as the number of common documents for every pair of words, can we infer which words appear in which documents&quest; In this article, we develop a general methodology for answering questions like these.We formalize these questions in what we call the Reconstructproblem: given information about the common neighbors of nodes in a network, our goal is to reconstruct the hidden binary matrix that indicates the presence or absence of relationships between individual nodes. In fact, we propose two different variants of this problem: one where the number of connections of every node (i.e., the degree of every node) is known and a second one where it is unknown. We call these variants thedegree-awareand thedegree-obliviousversions of the Reconstructproblem, respectively.Our algorithms for both variants exploit the properties of the singular value decomposition of the hidden binary matrix. More specifically, we show that using the available neighborhood information, we can reconstruct the hidden matrix by finding the components of its singular value decomposition and then combining them appropriately. Our extensive experimental study suggests that our methods are able to reconstruct binary matrices of different characteristics with up to 100&percnt; accuracy.", "authors": [{"name": "dora erdos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81496679142"}, {"name": "rainer gemulla", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314494235"}, {"name": "evimaria terzi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100469792"}], "title": "Reconstructing Graphs from Neighborhood Data", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "64\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "11\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "230\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "boston university boston ma usa", "city": "boston", "Name": "dora erdos"}, {"country": "germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "max planck institut fur informatik germany", "city": null, "Name": "rainer gemulla"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "boston university boston ma usa", "city": "boston", "Name": "evimaria terzi"}]}, "Article No.: 20": {"references": ["Ittai Abraham , Daniel Delling , Amos Fiat , Andrew V.

Exact algorithms for these problems exist and are widely used, but their running time is hindered by the need of scanning the entire dataset, possibly multiple times. High-quality approximations of FIs and ARs are sufficient for most practical uses. Sampling techniques can be used for fast discovery of approximate solutions, but works exploring this technique did not provide satisfactory performance guarantees on the quality of the approximation due to the difficulty of bounding the probability of under- or oversampling any one of an unknown number of frequent itemsets. We circumvent this issue by applying the statistical concept ofVapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimensionto develop a novel technique for providing tight bounds on the sample size that guarantees approximation of the (top-K) FIs and ARs within user-specified parameters. The resulting sample size is linearly dependent on the VC-dimension of a range space associated with the dataset. We analyze the VC-dimension of this range space and show that it is upper bounded by an easy-to-compute characteristic quantity of the dataset, thed-index, namely, the maximum integerdsuch that the dataset contains at leastdtransactions of length at leastdsuch that no one of them is a superset of or equal to another. We show that this bound is tight for a large class of datasets. The resulting sample size is a significant improvement over previous known results. We present an extensive experimental evaluation of our technique on real and artificial datasets, demonstrating the practicality of our methods, and showing that they achieve even higher quality approximations than what is guaranteed by the analysis.", "authors": [{"name": "matteo riondato", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81467665989"}, {"name": "eli upfal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339533412"}], "title": "Efficient Discovery of Association Rules and Frequent Itemsets through Sampling with Tight Performance Guarantees", "citations": [{"Name": "Matteo Riondato ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Eli Upfal", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "152\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "294\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "brown university usa", "city": null, "Name": "matteo riondato"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "brown university usa", "city": null, "Name": "eli upfal"}]}, "Article No.: 18": {"references": ["Leman Akoglu , Hanghang Tong , Jilles Vreeken , Christos Faloutsos, Fast and reliable anomaly detection in categorical data, Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management, October 29-November 02, 2012, Maui, Hawaii, USA[doi>10.1145/2396761.2396816]\n", "Roberto J.

Among other tasks, matrix factorizations are often used to separate global structure from noise. This, however, requires solving the \u201cmodel order selection problem\u201d of determining the proper rank of the factorization, that is, to answer where fine-grained structure stops, and where noise starts.Boolean Matrix Factorization (BMF)\u2014where data, factors, and matrix product are Boolean\u2014has in recent years received increased attention from the data mining community. The technique has desirable properties, such as high interpretability and natural sparsity. Yet, so far no method for selecting the correct model order for BMF has been available. In this article, we propose the use of the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle for this task. Besides solving the problem, this well-founded approach has numerous benefits; for example, it is automatic, does not require a likelihood function, is fast, and, as experiments show, is highly accurate.We formulate the description length function for BMF in general\u2014making it applicable for any BMF algorithm. We discuss how to construct an appropriate encoding: starting from a simple and intuitive approach, we arrive at a highly efficient data-to-model--based encoding for BMF. We extend an existing algorithm for BMF to use MDL to identify the best Boolean matrix factorization, analyze the complexity of the problem, and perform an extensive experimental evaluation to study its behavior.", "authors": [{"name": "pauli miettinen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367594364"}, {"name": "jilles vreeken", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81335499054"}], "title": "MDL4BMF: Minimum Description Length for Boolean Matrix Factorization", "citations": [{"Name": "Samuel Maurus ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Claudia Plant", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "81\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "151\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "max-planck institute for informatics saarbrucken germany", "city": "saarbrucken", "Name": "pauli miettinen"}, {"country": "Belgium", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "max-planck institute for informatics saarland university university of antwerp antwerp belgium", "city": "antwerp", "Name": "jilles vreeken"}]}, "Article No.: 17": {"references": ["Gaurav Bansal , Atish Sinha , Huimin Zhao, Tuning Data Mining Methods for Cost-Sensitive Regression: A Study in Loan Charge-Off Forecasting, Journal of Management Information Systems, v.25 n.3, p.315-336, Number 3 / Winter 2008-9[doi>10.2753/MIS0742-1222250309]\n", "A.

When the operating context changes, one may fine-tune the by-default (incontextual) prediction or may even abstain from predicting a value (a reject).Globalreframing solutions, where the same function is applied to adapt the estimated outputs to a new cost context, are possible solutions here. An alternative approach, which has not been studied in a comprehensive way for regression in the knowledge discovery and data mining literature, is the use of alocal(e.g., probabilistic) reframing approach, where decisions are made according to the estimated outputanda reliability, confidence, or probability estimation. In this article, we advocate for a simple two-parameter (mean and variance) approach, working with anormalconditional probability density. Given the conditional mean produced by any regression technique, we develop lightweight \u201cenrichment\u201d methods that produce good estimates of the conditional variance, which are used by theprobabilistic(local) reframing methods. We apply these methods to some very common families of cost-sensitive problems, such as optimal predictions in (auction) bids, asymmetric loss scenarios, and rejection rules.", "authors": [{"name": "jose hernndez-orallo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658632605"}], "title": "Probabilistic Reframing for Cost-Sensitive Regression", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "52\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "142\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Philippines", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universitat politecnica de valencia spain", "city": "valencia", "Name": "jose hernndez-orallo"}]}, "Article No.: 21": {"references": ["Y.-Y.

This problem differs from local community mining, in that the query set defines the circle of interest. We explicitly handle edge direction, as in many cases relationships are not symmetric, and focus on the local context because many real-world graphs cannot be feasibly known. We outline several issues that are unique to this context, introduce a quality function to measure the value of including a particular node in an emerging social circle, and describe a greedy social circle discovery algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on artificial benchmarks, large networks with topical community labels, and several real-world case studies.", "authors": [{"name": "scott h burton", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81496649724"}, {"name": "christophe g giraud-carrier", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81341490680"}], "title": "Discovering Social Circles in Directed Graphs", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "123\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "14\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "280\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Uruguay", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "brigham young university idaho", "city": "young", "Name": "scott h burton"}, {"country": "Uruguay", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "brigham young university provo ut", "city": "young", "Name": "christophe g giraud-carrier"}]}}, "date": {"month": "October", "year": "2014"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Ioannis Antonellis , Hector Garcia Molina , Chi Chao Chang, Simrank++: query rewriting through link analysis of the click graph, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, v.1 n.1, August 2008\n", "D.

Two nodes have the same role if they interact withequivalentsets of neighbors. The most fundamental role equivalence is automorphic equivalence. Unfortunately, the fastest algorithms known for graph automorphism are nonpolynomial. Moreover, since exact equivalence is rare, a more meaningful task is measuring the rolesimilaritybetween any two nodes. This task is closely related to the structural or link-based similarity problem that SimRank addresses. However, SimRank and other existing similarity measures are not sufficient because they do not guarantee to recognize automorphically or structurally equivalent nodes. This article makes two contributions. First, we present and justify several axiomatic properties necessary for a role similarity measure or metric. Second, we present RoleSim, a new similarity metric that satisfies these axioms and can be computed with a simple iterative algorithm. We rigorously prove that RoleSim satisfies all of these axiomatic properties. We also introduce Iceberg RoleSim, a scalable algorithm that discovers all pairs with RoleSim scores above a user-defined threshold \u03b8. We demonstrate the interpretative power of RoleSim on both both synthetic and real datasets.", "authors": [{"name": "ruoming jin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100054574"}, {"name": "victor e lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87358627257"}, {"name": "longjie li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87358740957"}], "title": "Scalable and axiomatic ranking of network role similarity", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "48\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "214\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "kent state university kent oh", "city": null, "Name": "ruoming jin"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "john carroll university", "city": null, "Name": "victor e lee"}, {"country": "china", "university": "lanzhou university", "affiliation_string": "lanzhou university", "city": "lanzhou", "Name": "longjie li"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Kevin Bauer , Damon McCoy , Dirk Grunwald , Tadayoshi Kohno , Douglas Sicker, Low-resource routing attacks against tor, Proceedings of the 2007 ACM workshop on Privacy in electronic society, October 29-29, 2007, Alexandria, Virginia, USA[doi>10.1145/1314333.1314336]\n", "Fabricio Benevenuto, Gabriel Magno, Tiago Rodrigues, and Virgilio Almeida. 2010.

We use ground truth provided by Renren Inc. to build measurement-based Sybil detectors and deploy them on Renren to detect more than 100,000 Sybil accounts. Using our full dataset of 650,000 Sybils, we examine several aspects of Sybil behavior. First, we study their link creation behavior and find that contrary to prior conjecture, Sybils in OSNs do not form tight-knit communities. Next, we examine the fine-grained behaviors of Sybils on Renren using clickstream data. Third, we investigate behind-the-scenes collusion between large groups of Sybils. Our results reveal that Sybils with no explicit social ties still act in concert to launch attacks. Finally, we investigate enhanced techniques to identify stealthy Sybils. In summary, our study advances the understanding of Sybil behavior on OSNs and shows that Sybils can effectively avoid existing community-based Sybil detectors. We hope that our results will foster new research on Sybil detection that is based on novel types of Sybil features.", "authors": [{"name": "zhi yang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81317503259"}, {"name": "christo wilson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81416593396"}, {"name": "xiao wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339534386"}, {"name": "tingting gao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81430650322"}, {"name": "ben y zhao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81408593196"}, {"name": "yafei dai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323489020"}], "title": "Uncovering social network Sybils in the wild", "citations": [{"Name": "Supraja Gurajala ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Joshua S.

In this article, we present a class separability framework to tackle these challenges through a comprehensive analysis of community properties. Our approach enables the assessment of the structural dissimilarity among the output of multiple community detection algorithms and between the output of algorithms and communities that arise in practice. In addition, our method provides us with a way to organize the vast collection of community detection algorithms by grouping those that behave similarly. Finally, we identify the most discriminative graph-theoretical properties of community signature and the small subset of properties that account for most of the biases of the different community detection algorithms. We illustrate our approach with an experimental analysis, which reveals nuances of the structure of real and extracted communities. In our experiments, we furnish our framework with the output of 10 different community detection procedures, representative of categories of popular algorithms available in the literature, applied to a diverse collection of large-scale real network datasets whose domains span biology, online shopping, and social systems. We also analyze communities identified by annotations that accompany the data, which reflect exemplar communities in various domain. We characterize these communities using a broad spectrum of community properties to produce the different structural classes. As our experiments show that community structure is not a universal concept, our framework enables an informed choice of the most suitable community detection method for identifying communities of a specific type in a given network and allows for a comparison of existing community detection algorithms while guiding the design of new ones.", "authors": [{"name": "bruno abrahao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367599282"}, {"name": "sucheta soundarajan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81498658835"}, {"name": "john hopcroft", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100008350"}, {"name": "robert kleinberg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100287473"}], "title": "A separability framework for analyzing community structure", "citations": [{"Name": "Yixuan Li ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kun He ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "David Bindel ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "John E.

A major challenge lies in that although many previous works model user behavior from only historical behavior logs, the available user behavior data or interactions between users and items in a given social network are usually very limited and sparse (e.g., &ges; 99.9&percnt; empty), which makes models overfit the rare observations and fail to provide accurate predictions. We observe that many people are members of several social networks in the same time, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Tencent\u2019s QQ. Importantly, users\u2019 behaviors and interests in different networks influence one another. This provides an opportunity to leverage the knowledge of user behaviors in different networks by considering the overlapping users in different networks as bridges, in order to alleviate the data sparsity problem, and enhance the predictive performance of user behavior modeling. Combining different networks \u201csimply and naively\u201d does not work well. In this article, we formulate the problem to model multiple networks as \u201cadaptive composite transfer\u201d and propose a framework calledComSoc. ComSoc first selects the most suitable networks inside a composite social network via a hierarchical Bayesian model, parameterized for individual users. It then builds topic models for user behavior prediction using both the relationships in the selected networks and related behavior data. With different relational regularization, we introduce different implementations, corresponding to different ways to transfer knowledge from composite social relations. To handle big data, we have implemented the algorithm using Map/Reduce. We demonstrate that the proposed composite network-based user behavior models significantly improve the predictive accuracy over a number of existing approaches on several real-world applications, including a very large social networking dataset from Tencent Inc.", "authors": [{"name": "erheng zhong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436592458"}, {"name": "wei fan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81557936656"}, {"name": "qiang yang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81372591186"}], "title": "User behavior learning and transfer in composite social networks", "citations": [{"Name": "Weike Pan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shanchuan Xia ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zhuode Liu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiaogang Peng ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zhong Ming", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mixed factorization for collaborative recommendation with heterogeneous explicit feedbacks", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "337\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "27\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "1233\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "hong kong university of science and technology hong kong", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "erheng zhong"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "qiang yang", "city": null, "Name": "wei fan"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["D.

Social networking sites allow users to manually categorize their friends into social circles (e.g., \u201ccircles\u201d on Google&plus;, and \u201clists\u201d on Facebook and Twitter). However, circles are laborious to construct and must be manually updated whenever a user's network grows. In this article, we study the novel task of automatically identifying users' social circles. We pose this task as a multimembership node clustering problem on a user's ego network, a network of connections between her friends. We develop a model for detecting circles that combines network structure as well as user profile information. For each circle, we learn its members and the circle-specific user profile similarity metric. Modeling node membership to multiple circles allows us to detect overlapping as well as hierarchically nested circles. Experiments show that our model accurately identifies circles on a diverse set of data from Facebook, Google&plus;, and Twitter, for all of which we obtain hand-labeled ground truth.", "authors": [{"name": "julian mcauley", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81388594589"}, {"name": "jure leskovec", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367595814"}], "title": "Discovering social circles in ego networks", "citations": [{"Name": "Lilly Kumari ", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sunny Dhamnani ", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Akshat Bhatnagar ", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Atanu R.

However, their computation appears highly demanding, as assessing whether an itemset is self-sufficient requires consideration of all pairwise partitions of the itemset into pairs of subsets as well as consideration of all supersets. This article presents the first published algorithm for efficiently discovering self-sufficient itemsets. This branch-and-bound algorithm deploys two powerful pruning mechanisms based on upper bounds on itemset value and statistical significance level. It demonstrates that finding top-kproductive and nonredundant itemsets, with postprocessing to identify those that are not independently productive, can efficiently identify small sets of key associations. We present extensive evaluation of the strengths and limitations of the technique, including comparisons with alternative approaches to finding the most interesting associations.", "authors": [{"name": "geoffrey i webb", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100016406"}, {"name": "jilles vreeken", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81335499054"}], "title": "Efficient Discovery of the Most Interesting Associations", "citations": [{"Name": "Aleksey Buzmakov ", "Country": "argentina", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sergei Kuznetsov ", "Country": "argentina", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Amedeo Napoli", "Country": "argentina", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "228\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "28\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "550\n", "Citation Count": "4\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "australia", "university": "monash university", "affiliation_string": "monash university australia", "city": "clayton", "Name": "geoffrey i webb"}, {"country": "Belgium", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of antwerp belgium", "city": "antwerp", "Name": "jilles vreeken"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Lada A.

One key aspect of social network research is identifying important missing information that is not explicitly represented in the network, or is not visible to all. To date, this line of research typically focused on finding the connections that are missing between nodes, a challenge typically termed as thelink prediction problem.This article introduces the missing node identification problem, where missing members in the social network structure must be identified. In this problem, indications of missing nodes are assumed to exist. Given these indications and a partial network, we must assess which indications originate from the same missing node and determine the full network structure.Toward solving this problem, we present the missing node identification by spectral clustering algorithm (MISC), an approach based on a spectral clustering algorithm, combined with nodes\u2019 pairwise affinity measures that were adopted from link prediction research. We evaluate the performance of our approach in different problem settings and scenarios, using real-life data from Facebook. The results show that our approach has beneficial results and can be effective in solving the missing node identification problem. In addition, this article also presents R-MISC, which uses a sparse matrix representation, efficient algorithms for calculating the nodes\u2019 pairwise affinity, and a proprietary dimension reduction technique to enable scaling the MISC algorithm to large networks of more than 100,000 nodes. Last, we consider problem settings where some of the indications are unknown. Two algorithms are suggested for this problem: speculative MISC, based on MISC, and missing link completion, based on classical link prediction literature. We show that speculative MISC outperforms missing link completion.", "authors": [{"name": "ron eyal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=89758697457"}, {"name": "avi rosenfeld", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350597386"}, {"name": "sigal sina", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=86159220257"}, {"name": "sarit kraus", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100585484"}], "title": "Predicting and Identifying Missing Node Information in Social Networks", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "111\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "19\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "292\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "bar-ilan university israel", "city": null, "Name": "ron eyal"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "jerusalem college of technology", "city": null, "Name": "avi rosenfeld"}, {"country": "israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "bar-ilan university israel", "city": null, "Name": "sigal sina"}, {"country": "israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "bar-ilan university israel", "city": null, "Name": "sarit kraus"}]}, "Article No.: 16": {"references": ["Wade H.

We assume that users can be either trusted or untrusted. The access of untrusted parties to data objects (e.g., client and patient records) should be monitored in an attempt to detect misuse. However, monitoring data objects is resource intensive and time-consuming and may also cause disturbance or inconvenience to the involved employees. Therefore, the monitored data objects should be carefully selected. In this article, we present two optimization problems carefully designed for selecting specific data objects for monitoring, such that the detection rate is maximized and the monitoring effort is minimized. In the first optimization problem, the goal is to select data objects for monitoring that are accessed by at mostctrusted agents while ensuring access to at leastkmonitored objects by each untrusted agent (bothcandkare integer variable). As opposed to the first optimization problem, the goal of the second optimization problem is to select monitored data objects that maximize the number of monitored data objects accessed by untrusted agents while ensuring that each trusted agent does not access more thandmonitored data objects (dis an integer variable as well). Two efficient heuristic algorithms for solving these optimization problems are proposed, and experiments were conducted simulating different scenarios to evaluate the algorithms\u2019 performance. Moreover, we compared the heuristic algorithms\u2019 performance to the optimal solution and conducted sensitivity analysis on the three parameters (c,k, andd) and on the ratio between the trusted and untrusted agents.", "authors": [{"name": "asaf shabtai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319501489"}, {"name": "maya bercovitch", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=89558696957"}, {"name": "lior rokach", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331503121"}, {"name": "yuval elovici", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100379972"}], "title": "Optimizing Data Misuse Detection", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "116\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "11\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "360\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ben-gurion university of the negev israel", "city": "negev", "Name": "asaf shabtai"}, {"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ben-gurion university of the negev israel", "city": "negev", "Name": "maya bercovitch"}, {"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ben-gurion university of the negev israel", "city": "negev", "Name": "lior rokach"}, {"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ben-gurion university of the negev israel", "city": "negev", "Name": "yuval elovici"}]}, "Article No.: 12": {"references": ["Rie Kubota Ando , Tong Zhang, A Framework for Learning Predictive Structures from Multiple Tasks and Unlabeled Data, The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 6, p.1817-1853, 12/1/2005\n", "C.

In this article, we propose a regularization approach to learning the relationships between tasks in multitask learning. This approach can be viewed as a novel generalization of the regularized formulation for single-task learning. Besides modeling positive task correlation, our approach\u2014multitask relationship learning (MTRL)\u2014can also describe negative task correlation and identify outlier tasks based on the same underlying principle. By utilizing a matrix-variate normal distribution as a prior on the model parameters of all tasks, our MTRL method has a jointly convex objective function. For efficiency, we use an alternating method to learn the optimal model parameters for each task as well as the relationships between tasks. We study MTRL in the symmetric multitask learning setting and then generalize it to the asymmetric setting as well. We also discuss some variants of the regularization approach to demonstrate the use of other matrix-variate priors for learning task relationships. Moreover, to gain more insight into our model, we also study the relationships between MTRL and some existing multitask learning methods. Experiments conducted on a toy problem as well as several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MTRL as well as its high interpretability revealed by the task covariance matrix.", "authors": [{"name": "yu zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82458781057"}, {"name": "dit-yan yeung", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100614347"}], "title": "A Regularization Approach to Learning Task Relationships in Multitask Learning", "citations": [{"Name": "Zhaonan Sun ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fei Wang ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jianying Hu", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "143\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "13\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "406\n", "Citation Count": "4\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "hong kong", "university": "hong kong baptist university", "affiliation_string": "department of computer science hong kong baptist university", "city": "jiulong", "Name": "yu zhang"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "department of computer science and engineering hong kong university of science and technology", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "dit-yan yeung"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["Trine Julie Abrahamsen , Lars Kai Hansen, A Cure for Variance Inflation in High Dimensional Kernel Principal Component Analysis, The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 12, p.2027-2044, 2/1/2011\n", "A.

However, since each data point enters the objective function with squared residue error, a few outliers with large errors easily dominate the objective function. In this article, we propose a Robust Manifold Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (RMNMF) method using &ell;2,1-norm and integrating NMF and spectral clustering under the same clustering framework. We also point out the solution uniqueness issue for the existing NMF methods and propose an additional orthonormal constraint to address this problem. With the new constraint, the conventional auxiliary function approach no longer works. We tackle this difficult optimization problem via a novel Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM)--based algorithm and convert the original constrained optimization problem on one variable into a multivariate constrained problem. The new objective function then can be decomposed into several subproblems that each has a closed-form solution. More importantly, we reveal the connection of our method with robustK-means and spectral clustering, and we demonstrate its theoretical significance.

A traditional approach to model monitoring data is to discover invariant relationships among the monitoring data. Indeed, we can discover all invariant relationships among all pairs of monitoring data and generate invariant networks, where a node is a monitoring data source (metric) and a link indicates an invariant relationship between two monitoring data. Such an invariant network representation can help system experts to localize and diagnose the system faults by examining those broken invariant relationships and their related metrics, since system faults usually propagate among the monitoring data and eventually lead to some broken invariant relationships. However, at one time, there are usually a lot of broken links (invariant relationships) within an invariant network. Without proper guidance, it is difficult for system experts to manually inspect this large number of broken links. To this end, in this article, we propose the problem of ranking metrics according to the anomaly levels for a given invariant network, while this is a nontrivial task due to the uncertainties and the complex nature of invariant networks. Specifically, we propose two types of algorithms for ranking metric anomaly by link analysis in invariant networks. Along this line, we first define two measurements to quantify the anomaly level of each metric, and introduce the mRank algorithm. Also, we provide a weighted score mechanism and develop the gRank algorithm, which involves an iterative process to obtain a score to measure the anomaly levels. In addition, some extended algorithms based on mRank and gRank algorithms are developed by taking into account the probability of being broken as well as noisy links.

Multiway data analysis techniques, in particular tensor decompositions, allow extraction of hidden correlations among multiway data and thus are key components of many data analysis frameworks. Intuitively, these algorithms can be thought of asmultiway clusteringschemes, which consider multiple facets of the data in identifying clusters, their weights, and contributions of each data element. Unfortunately, algorithms for fitting multiway models are, in general, iterative and very time consuming. In this article, we observe that, in many applications, there is a priori background knowledge (or metadata) about one or more domain dimensions. This metadata is often in the form of a hierarchy that clusters the elements of a given data facet (or mode). We investigate whether such single-mode data hierarchies can be used to boost the efficiency of tensor decomposition process, without significant impact on the final decomposition quality. We consider each domain hierarchy as a guide to help provide higher- or lower-resolution views of the data in the tensor on demand and we rely on these metadata-induced multiresolution tensor representations to develop a multiresolution approach to tensor decomposition. In this article, we focus on an alternating least squares (ALS)--based implementation of the two most important decomposition models such as the PARAllel FACtors (PARAFAC, which decomposes a tensor into a diagonal tensor and a set of factor matrices) and the Tucker (which produces as result a core tensor and a set of dimension-subspaces matrices). Experiment results show that, when the available metadata is used as a rough guide, the proposed multiresolution method helps fit both PARAFAC and Tucker models with consistent (under different parameters settings) savings in execution time and memory consumption, while preserving the quality of the decomposition.", "authors": [{"name": "claudio schifanella", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413605740"}, {"name": "k selcuk candan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81313483426"}, {"name": "maria luisa sapino", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100124881"}], "title": "Multiresolution Tensor Decompositions with Mode Hierarchies", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "64\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "15\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "142\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of torino", "city": null, "Name": "claudio schifanella"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "arizona state university", "city": null, "Name": "k selcuk candan"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of torino", "city": null, "Name": "maria luisa sapino"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Lada A.

Since many real-world networks are massive in size, continuously evolving, and/or distributed in nature, the network structure is often sampled in order to facilitate study. For these reasons, a more thorough and complete understanding of network sampling is critical to support the field of network science. In this paper, we outline a framework for the general problem of network sampling by highlighting the different objectives, population and units of interest, and classes of network sampling methods. In addition, we propose a spectrum of computational models for network sampling methods, ranging from the traditionally studied model based on the assumption of a static domain to a more challenging model that is appropriate for streaming domains. We design a family of sampling methods based on the concept of graph induction that generalize across the full spectrum of computational models (from static to streaming) while efficiently preserving many of the topological properties of the input graphs. Furthermore, we demonstrate how traditional static sampling algorithms can be modified for graph streams for each of the three main classes of sampling methods: node, edge, and topology-based sampling. Experimental results indicate that our proposed family of sampling methods more accurately preserve the underlying properties of the graph in both static and streaming domains. Finally, we study the impact of network sampling algorithms on the parameter estimation and performance evaluation of relational classification algorithms.", "authors": [{"name": "nesreen k ahmed", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81466645185"}, {"name": "jennifer neville", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100563777"}, {"name": "ramana kompella", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100414898"}], "title": "Network Sampling: From Static to Streaming Graphs", "citations": [{"Name": "Ryan A.

Given a sequence of values, a prominent streak is a long consecutive subsequence consisting of only large (small) values, such as consecutive games of outstanding performance in sports, consecutive hours of heavy network traffic, and consecutive days of frequent mentioning of a person in social media. Prominent streak discovery provides insightful data patterns for data analysis in many real-world applications and is an enabling technique for computational journalism. Given its real-world usefulness and complexity, the research on prominent streaks in sequence data opens a spectrum of challenging problems.A baseline approach to finding prominent streaks is a quadratic algorithm that exhaustively enumerates all possible streaks and performs pairwise streak dominance comparison. For more efficient methods, we make the observation that prominent streaks are in fact skyline points in two dimensions\u2014streak interval length and minimum value in the interval. Our solution thus hinges on the idea to separate the two steps in prominent streak discovery: candidate streak generation and skyline operation over candidate streaks. For candidate generation, we propose the concept of local prominent streak (LPS). We prove that prominent streaks are a subset of LPSs and the number of LPSs is less than the length of a data sequence, in comparison with the quadratic number of candidates produced by the brute-force baseline method. We develop efficient algorithms based on the concept of LPS. The nonlinear local prominent streak (NLPS)-based method considers a superset of LPSs as candidates, and the linear local prominent streak (LLPS)-based method further guarantees to consider only LPSs. The proposed properties and algorithms are also extended for discovering general top-k, multisequence, and multidimensional prominent streaks. The results of experiments using multiple real datasets verified the effectiveness of the proposed methods and showed orders of magnitude performance improvement against the baseline method.", "authors": [{"name": "gensheng zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=89558693157"}, {"name": "xiao jiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81488652238"}, {"name": "ping luo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100416055"}, {"name": "min wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81555605956"}, {"name": "chengkai li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81372591626"}], "title": "Discovering General Prominent Streaks in Sequence Data", "citations": [{"Name": "Naeemul Hassan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Afroza Sultana ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "You Wu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gensheng Zhang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chengkai Li ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jun Yang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Cong Yu", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Data in", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "63\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "185\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of texas at arlington", "city": null, "Name": "gensheng zhang"}, {"country": "Kyrgyzstan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "shanghai jiao tong university", "city": "tong", "Name": "xiao jiang"}, {"country": "china", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "hp labs china", "city": null, "Name": "ping luo"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "chengkai li", "city": null, "Name": "min wang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "xiao jiang", "city": null, "Name": "the university of texas at arlington"}]}}, "date": {"month": "June", "year": "2014"}}}, "Volume1": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Charu C.

By using mixture modeling it is often possible to accurately model even complex, multimodal data via very simple components. However, the classical mixture model assumes that a data point is generated by a single component in the model. A lot of datasets can be modeled closer to the underlying reality if we drop this restriction. We propose a probabilistic framework, themixture-of-subsets (MOS) model, by making two fundamental changes to the classical mixture model. First, we allow a data point to be generated by a set of components, rather than just a single component. Next, we limit the number of data attributes that each component can influence. We also propose an EM framework to learn the MOS model from a dataset, and experimentally evaluate it on real, high-dimensional datasets. Our results show that the MOS model learned from the data represents the underlying nature of the data accurately.", "authors": [{"name": "manas somaiya", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81343505654"}, {"name": "christopher jermaine", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100586871"}, {"name": "sanjay ranka", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100550831"}], "title": "Learning correlations using the mixture-of-subsets model", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "23\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "795\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Uruguay", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of florida gainesville fl", "city": "florida", "Name": "manas somaiya"}, {"country": "Uruguay", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of florida gainesville fl", "city": "florida", "Name": "christopher jermaine"}, {"country": "Uruguay", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of florida gainesville fl", "city": "florida", "Name": "sanjay ranka"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["Gediminas Adomavicius , Alexander Tuzhilin, Using Data Mining Methods to Build Customer Profiles, Computer, v.34 n.2, p.74-82, February 2001[doi>10.1109/2.901170]\n", "Charu C.

A topic taxonomy consists of topic nodes. Each internal node is defined by its vertical path (i.e., ancestor and child nodes) and its horizonal list of attributes (or terms). In a text-dominant environment, a topic taxonomy can be used to flexibly describe a group's interests with varying granularity. However, the stagnant nature of a taxonomy may fail to timely capture the dynamic change of a group's interest. This article addresses the problem of how to adapt a topic taxonomy to the accumulated data that reflects the change of a group's interest to achieve dynamic group profiling. We first discuss the issues related to topic taxonomy. We next formulate taxonomy adaptation as an optimization problem to find the taxonomy that best fits the data. We then present a viable algorithm that can efficiently accomplish taxonomy adaptation. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our approach's efficacy for group profiling, compare the approach with some alternatives, and study its performance for dynamic group profiling. While pointing out various applications of taxonomy adaption, we suggest some future work that can take advantage of burgeoning Web 2.0 services for online targeted marketing, counterterrorism in connecting dots, and community tracking.", "authors": [{"name": "lei tang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81363600542"}, {"name": "huan liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367594306"}, {"name": "jianping zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81343510227"}, {"name": "nitin agarwal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100021279"}, {"name": "john j salerno", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100299894"}], "title": "Topic taxonomy adaptation for group profiling", "citations": [{"Name": "Mario Cataldi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "K.

Providing an aggregate view of such data is important for summarization, visualization, and analysis. We develop an aggregate view based on certain organized sets of large-valued regions (\u201cheavy hitters\u201d) corresponding to hierarchically discounted frequency counts. We formally define the notion ofhierarchical heavy hitters(HHHs). We first consider computing (approximate) HHHs over a data stream drawn from a single hierarchical attribute. We formalize the problem and give deterministic algorithms to find them in a single pass over the input.In order to analyze a wider range of realistic data streams (e.g., from IP traffic-monitoring applications), we generalize this problem to multiple dimensions. Here, the semantics of HHHs are more complex, since a \u201cchild\u201d node can have multiple \u201cparent\u201d nodes. We present online algorithms that find approximate HHHs in one pass, with provable accuracy guarantees. The product of hierarchical dimensions forms a mathematical lattice structure. Our algorithms exploit this structure, and so are able to track approximate HHHs using only a small, fixed number of statistics per stored item, regardless of the number of dimensions.We show experimentally, using real data, that our proposed algorithms yields outputs which are very similar (virtually identical, in many cases) to offline computations of the exact solutions, whereas straightforward heavy-hitters-based approaches give significantly inferior answer quality. Furthermore, the proposed algorithms result in an order of magnitude savings in data structure size while performing competitively.", "authors": [{"name": "graham cormode", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100135281"}, {"name": "flip korn", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100632175"}, {"name": "s muthukrishnan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350571838"}, {"name": "divesh srivastava", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100062835"}], "title": "Finding hierarchical heavy hitters in streaming data", "citations": [{"Name": "Ignasi Paredes-Oliva ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Pere Barlet-Ros ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xenofontas Dimitropoulos", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "FaRNet: Fast recognition of high-dimensional patterns from big network traffic data", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "M.

However, given the lack of information about network evolution over long periods, it has been hard to convert these findings into statements about trends over time.Here we study a wide range of real graphs, and we observe some surprising phenomena. First, most of these graphs densify over time with the number of edges growing superlinearly in the number of nodes. Second, the average distance between nodes often shrinks over time in contrast to the conventional wisdom that such distance parameters should increase slowly as a function of the number of nodes (likeO(logn) orO(log(logn)).Existing graph generation models do not exhibit these types of behavior even at a qualitative level. We provide a new graph generator, based on a forest fire spreading process that has a simple, intuitive justification, requires very few parameters (like the flammability of nodes), and produces graphs exhibiting the full range of properties observed both in prior work and in the present study.We also notice that the forest fire model exhibits a sharp transition between sparse graphs and graphs that are densifying. Graphs with decreasing distance between the nodes are generated around this transition point.Last, we analyze the connection between the temporal evolution of the degree distribution and densification of a graph. We find that the two are fundamentally related. We also observe that real networks exhibit this type of relation between densification and the degree distribution.", "authors": [{"name": "jure leskovec", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100096826"}, {"name": "jon kleinberg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100288264"}, {"name": "christos faloutsos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100373169"}], "title": "Graph evolution: Densification and shrinking diameters", "citations": [{"Name": "Yuxi Hu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mina Doroud ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "S.

In recent years, a new definition of privacy calledk-anonymity has gained popularity. In ak-anonymized dataset, each record is indistinguishable from at leastk\u2212 1 other records with respect to certain identifying attributes.In this article, we show using two simple attacks that ak-anonymized dataset has some subtle but severe privacy problems. First, an attacker can discover the values of sensitive attributes when there is little diversity in those sensitive attributes. This is a known problem. Second, attackers often have background knowledge, and we show thatk-anonymity does not guarantee privacy against attackers using background knowledge. We give a detailed analysis of these two attacks, and we propose a novel and powerful privacy criterion called &ell;-diversity that can defend against such attacks.

This problem,clustering aggregation, appears naturally in various contexts. For example, clustering categorical data is an instance of the clustering aggregation problem; each categorical attribute can be viewed as a clustering of the input rows where rows are grouped together if they take the same value on that attribute. Clustering aggregation can also be used as a metaclustering method to improve the robustness of clustering by combining the output of multiple algorithms. Furthermore, the problem formulation does not require a priori information about the number of clusters; it is naturally determined by the optimization function.In this article, we give a formal statement of the clustering aggregation problem, and we propose a number of algorithms. Our algorithms make use of the connection between clustering aggregation and the problem ofcorrelation clustering. Although the problems we consider are NP-hard, for several of our methods, we provide theoretical guarantees on the quality of the solutions. Our work provides the best deterministic approximation algorithm for the variation of the correlation clustering problem we consider. We also show how sampling can be used to scale the algorithms for large datasets. We give an extensive empirical evaluation demonstrating the usefulness of the problem and of the solutions.", "authors": [{"name": "aristides gionis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100631289"}, {"name": "heikki mannila", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100086722"}, {"name": "panayiotis tsaparas", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100152625"}], "title": "Clustering aggregation", "citations": [{"Name": "Zhong She ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Can Wang ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Longbing Cao", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Walter J.

The absence of identifiers for the underlying entities often results in a database which contains multiple references to the same entity. This can lead not only to data redundancy, but also inaccuracies in query processing and knowledge extraction. These problems can be alleviated through the use ofentity resolution. Entity resolution involves discovering the underlying entities and mapping each database reference to these entities. Traditionally, entities are resolved using pairwise similarity over the attributes of references. However, there is often additional relational information in the data. Specifically, references to different entities may cooccur. In these cases, collective entity resolution, in which entities for cooccurring references are determined jointly rather than independently, can improve entity resolution accuracy. We propose a novel relational clustering algorithm that uses both attribute and relational information for determining the underlying domain entities, and we give an efficient implementation. We investigate the impact that different relational similarity measures have on entity resolution quality. We evaluate our collective entity resolution algorithm on multiple real-world databases. We show that it improves entity resolution performance over both attribute-based baselines and over algorithms that consider relational information but do not resolve entities collectively. In addition, we perform detailed experiments on synthetically generated data to identify data characteristics that favor collective relational resolution over purely attribute-based algorithms.", "authors": [{"name": "indrajit bhattacharya", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100376279"}, {"name": "lise getoor", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100205081"}], "title": "Collective entity resolution in relational data", "citations": [{"Name": "Indrajit Bhattacharya ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shantanu Godbole ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sachindra Joshi", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Anon Plangprasopchok ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kristina Lerman ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lise Getoor", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xin Luna Dong ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Eduard Constantin Dragut", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiaoling Sun ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jasleen Kaur ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lino Possamai ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Filippo Menczer", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ambiguous author query detection using crowdsourced digital library annotations", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Danai Symeonidou ", "Country": "greece", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nathalie Pernelle ", "Country": "greece", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fatiha Sa\u00efs", "Country": "greece", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Galileo Mark S.

In this article, we propose a robust framework for determining a natural clustering of a given dataset, based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle. The proposed framework,robust information-theoretic clustering (RIC), is orthogonal to any known clustering algorithm: Given a preliminary clustering, RIC purifies these clusters from noise, and adjusts the clusterings such that it simultaneously determines the most natural amount and shape (subspace) of the clusters. Our RIC method can be combined with any clustering technique ranging from K-means and K-medoids to advanced methods such as spectral clustering. In fact, RIC is even able to purify and improve an initial coarse clustering, even if we start with very simple methods. In an extension, we propose a fully automatic stand-alone clustering method and efficiency improvements. RIC scales well with the dataset size. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the proposed RIC framework.", "authors": [{"name": "christian bohm", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100395758"}, {"name": "christos faloutsos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100373169"}, {"name": "jia-yu pan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100485214"}, {"name": "claudia plant", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81321496970"}], "title": "RIC: Parameter-free noise-robust clustering", "citations": [{"Name": "Yasuko Matsubara ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yasushi Sakurai ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Willem G. van Panhuis ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Christos Faloutsos", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yasuko Matsubara ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yasushi Sakurai ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Christos Faloutsos", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "24\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "749\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of munich munich germany", "city": "munich", "Name": "christian bohm"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa", "city": "pittsburgh", "Name": "christos faloutsos"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "google mountain view ca", "city": null, "Name": "jia-yu pan"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of munich munich germany", "city": "munich", "Name": "claudia plant"}]}, "Article No.: 12": {"references": ["Barabasi, A.-L. and Albert, R. 1999.

In this article we describe a framework for detecting anomalous events in such data using an unsupervised learning approach. Normal periodic behavior is modeled via a time-varying Poisson process model, which in turn is modulated by a hidden Markov process that accounts for bursty events. We outline a Bayesian framework for learning the parameters of this model from count time-series. Two large real-world datasets of time-series counts are used as testbeds to validate the approach, consisting of freeway traffic data and logs of people entering and exiting a building. We show that the proposed model is significantly more accurate at detecting known events than a more traditional threshold-based technique. We also describe how the model can be used to investigate different degrees of periodicity in the data, including systematic day-of-week and time-of-day effects, and to make inferences about different aspects of events such as number of vehicles or people involved. The results indicate that the Markov-modulated Poisson framework provides a robust and accurate framework for adaptively and autonomously learning how to separate unusual bursty events from traces of normal human activity.", "authors": [{"name": "alexander ihler", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100495602"}, {"name": "jon hutchins", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100209367"}, {"name": "padhraic smyth", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100305321"}], "title": "Learning to detect events with Markov-modulated poisson processes", "citations": [{"Name": "Ahmed Nait Aicha ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gwenn Englebienne ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ben Kr\u00f6se", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Modeling visit behaviour in smart homes using unsupervised learning", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Radu-Corneliu Marin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ciprian Dobre ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fatos Xhafa", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "A methodology for assessing the predictable behaviour of mobile users in wireless networks", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Neela Sawant ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jia Li ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "James Z.

Research in frequent pattern mining has so far mostly focused on developing efficient algorithms to discover various kinds of frequent patterns, but little attention has been paid to the important next step\u2014interpreting the discovered frequent patterns. Although the compression and summarization of frequent patterns has been studied in some recent work, the proposed techniques there can only annotate a frequent pattern with nonsemantical information (e.g., support), which provides only limited help for a user to understand the patterns.In this article, we study the novel problem of generating semantic annotations for frequent patterns. The goal is to discover the hidden meanings of a frequent pattern by annotating it with in-depth, concise, and structured information. We propose a general approach to generate such an annotation for a frequent pattern by constructing its context model, selecting informative context indicators, and extracting representative transactions and semantically similar patterns. This general approach can well incorporate the user's prior knowledge, and has potentially many applications, such as generating a dictionary-like description for a pattern, finding synonym patterns, discovering semantic relations, and summarizing semantic classes of a set of frequent patterns. Experiments on different datasets show that our approach is effective in generating semantic pattern annotations.", "authors": [{"name": "qiaozhu mei", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100214997"}, {"name": "dong xin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100651387"}, {"name": "hong cheng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351596071"}, {"name": "jiawei han", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351593425"}, {"name": "chengxiang zhai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100540023"}], "title": "Semantic annotation of frequent patterns", "citations": [{"Name": "Sandro Jos\u00e9 Rigo ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jos\u00e9 Palazzo Oliveira", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Identifying Users Stereotypes with Semantic Web Mining", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Proceedings of the ER 2008 Workshops (CMLSA", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "ECDM", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "FP-UML", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "M2AS", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "RIGiM", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "SeCoGIS", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kwanho Kim ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Beom-Suk Chung ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yerim Choi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Seungjun Lee ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jae-Yoon Jung ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jonghun Park", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Language independent semantic kernels for short-text classification", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jonathan Chang ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jordan Boyd-Graber ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "David M.

For problems such as mining frequent sets and finding correlations, significance testing can be done by standard statistical tests such as chi-square, or other methods. However, the results of such tests depend only on the specific attributes and not on the dataset as a whole. Moreover, the tests are difficult to apply to sets of patterns or other complex results of data mining algorithms. In this article, we consider a simple randomization technique that deals with this shortcoming. The approach consists of producing random datasets that have the same row and column margins as the given dataset, computing the results of interest on the randomized instances and comparing them to the results on the actual data. This randomization technique can be used to assess the results of many different types of data mining algorithms, such as frequent sets, clustering, and spectral analysis. To generate random datasets with given margins, we use variations of a Markov chain approach which is based on a simple swap operation. We give theoretical results on the efficiency of different randomization methods, and apply the swap randomization method to several well-known datasets. Our results indicate that for some datasets the structure discovered by the data mining algorithms is expected, given the row and column margins of the datasets, while for other datasets the discovered structure conveys information that is not captured by the margin counts.", "authors": [{"name": "aristides gionis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100631289"}, {"name": "heikki mannila", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100086722"}, {"name": "taneli mielikainen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81321495651"}, {"name": "panayiotis tsaparas", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100152625"}], "title": "Assessing data mining results via swap randomization", "citations": [{"Name": "Michael Mampaey ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jilles Vreeken", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Summarising data by clustering items", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sami Hanhij\u00e4rvi ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Markus Ojala ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Niko Vuokko ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kai Puolam\u00e4ki ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nikolaj Tatti ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Heikki Mannila", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michael Mampaey ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nikolaj Tatti ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jilles Vreeken", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hao Wu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jilles Vreeken ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nikolaj Tatti ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Naren Ramakrishnan", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Markus Ojala ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gemma C.

To remedy this and to give more precise frequent exhibition periods of frequent temporal itemsets, we devise an efficient algorithmTwain(standing forTWo end AssocIation miNer.)Twainnot only generates frequent patterns with more precise frequent exhibition periods, but also discovers more interesting frequent patterns.Twainemploys Start time and End time of each item to provide precise frequent exhibition period while progressively handling itemsets from one partition to another. Along with one scan of the database,Twaincan generate frequent 2-itemsets directly according to the cumulative filtering threshold. Then,Twainadopts the scan reduction technique to generate all frequentk-itemsets (k> 2) from the generated frequent 2-itemsets. Theoretical properties ofTwainare derived as well in this article. The experimental results show thatTwainoutperforms the prior works in the quality of frequent patterns, execution time, I/O cost, CPU overhead and scalability.", "authors": [{"name": "jen-wei huang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451595001"}, {"name": "bi-ru dai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100172065"}, {"name": "ming-syan chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81450594725"}], "title": "Twain: Two-end association miner with precise frequent exhibition periods", "citations": [{"Name": "Tarek F.
