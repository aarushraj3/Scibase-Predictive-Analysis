One obstacle to consider is that there may be several different measures for closeness that are appropriate, either through different types of friendships, or different functions of distance on one kind of friendship, where only a subset of these networks may actually be relevant. Another is that these decisions are often binary and more difficult to model with conventional approaches, both conceptually and computationally. To address these issues, we present a hierarchical auto-probit model for individual binary outcomes that uses and extends the machinery of the auto-probit method for binary data. We demonstrate the behavior of the parameters estimated by the multiple network-regime auto-probit model (m-NAP) under various sensitivity conditions, such as the impact of the prior distribution and the nature of the structure of the network. We also demonstrate several examples of correlated binary data outcomes in networks of interest to information systems, including the adoption of caller ring-back tones, whose use is governed by direct connection but explained by additional network topologies.", "authors": [{"name": "bin zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81553266356"}, {"name": "andrew c thomas", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81553063656"}, {"name": "patrick doreian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100112989"}, {"name": "david krackhardt", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81460643321"}, {"name": "ramayya krishnan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100273575"}], "title": "Contrasting Multiple Social Network Autocorrelations for Binary Outcomes, With Applications To Technology Adoption", "citations": [{"Name": "Paulo B.

It has become increasingly important to understand how WOM content and metrics thereof are related to consumer purchases and product sales. By integrating network analysis with text sentiment mining techniques, we propose product comparison networks as a novel construct, computed from consumer product reviews. To test the validity of these product ranking measures, we conduct an empirical study based on a digital camera dataset from Amazon.com. The results demonstrate significant linkage between network-based measures and product sales, which is not fully captured by existing review measures such as numerical ratings. The findings provide important insights into the business impact of social media and user-generated content, an emerging problem in business intelligence research. From a managerial perspective, our results suggest that WOM in social media also constitutes a competitive landscape for firms to understand and manipulate.", "authors": [{"name": "zhu zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350600682"}, {"name": "chenhui guo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81479646320"}, {"name": "paulo goes", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100263166"}], "title": "Product Comparison Networks for Competitive Analysis of Online Word-of-Mouth", "citations": [{"Name": "Xue Bai ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "James R.

These teams use various media that are arguably less personal than face-to-face communication. One factor influencing the success of these teams is their ability to develop an understanding of who knows what during the initial team development stage. However, this development of understanding within dispersed teams may be impeded because of the limitations of technology-enabled communication environments. Past research has found that a limited understanding of team member capabilities hinders team performance. As such, this article investigates mechanisms for improving the recall of individuals within dispersed teams. Utilizing the input-process-output model to conceptualize the group interaction process, three input factors\u2014visual artifacts (i.e., a computer-generated image of each team member), team size, and work interruptions\u2014are manipulated to assess their influence on a person's ability to recall important characteristics of their virtual team members.

We contend that, as a socio-technical discipline, IS research must address the interaction between design and behavior. We begin with a background discussion of what we mean by IS research and the nature of the relationship between design and behavioral approaches to IS research. We discuss the nature of design, design science, and IT artifacts within information systems research and describe the importance of linking design and behavioral perspectives. We illustrate several key points using selected articles recently published inACM Transactions on Management Information Systems[Schmidt-Rauch and Schwabe 2011; Lau et al. 2011]. We conclude with a vision of IS research in which the capabilities and affordances of IT artifacts are incorporated into behavioral studies; the results of behavioral studies are utilized in the development and evaluation of IT artifacts; and both behavioral and design perspectives are used to address the important problems of our constituent community.", "authors": [{"name": "fred niederman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100190266"}, {"name": "salvatore t march", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100207203"}], "title": "Design science and the accumulation of knowledge in the information systems discipline", "citations": [{"Name": "T.

It has become increasingly important to understand how WOM content and metrics influence consumer purchases and product sales. By integrating marketing theories with text mining techniques, we propose a set of novel measures that focus on sentiment divergence in consumer product reviews. To test the validity of these metrics, we conduct an empirical study based on data from Amazon.com and BN.com (Barnes & Noble). The results demonstrate significant effects of our proposed measures on product sales. This effect is not fully captured by nontextual review measures such as numerical ratings. Furthermore, in capturing the sales effect of review content, our divergence metrics are shown to be superior to and more appropriate than some commonly used textual measures the literature. The findings provide important insights into the business impact of social media and user-generated content, an emerging problem in business intelligence research. From a managerial perspective, our results suggest that firms should pay special attention to textual content information when managing social media and, more importantly, focus on the right measures.", "authors": [{"name": "zhu zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350600682"}, {"name": "xin li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351597620"}, {"name": "yubo chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418595304"}], "title": "Deciphering word-of-mouth in social media: Text-based metrics of consumer reviews", "citations": [{"Name": "Niam Yaraghi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Anna Ye Du ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Raj Sharman ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ram D.

How the use of these tools affects knowledge coordination within virtual teams is not well understood. We distinguish between tools as features and the use of the virtual workspace as providing affordances for behaviors. Using situational awareness theory, we hypothesized two affordances of virtual workspaces that facilitate knowledge coordination. Using trading zone theory, we hypothesized two forms of trading zones created by features of virtual workspaces and the impact of these trading zones on the creation of affordances for team members. Members of 54 teams were asked about the affordances of the virtual workspace, and team leaders were asked about specific tools provided to the team. Our hypothesized model was supported: the different forms of trading zones were differentially related to the different affordances and on affordances were related to knowledge coordination satisfaction. Theoretical implications focus on the distinction between features and affordances and on the identification of specific features that affect specific affordances. Practical implications for managers and engineers supporting virtual teams include the utility of becoming knowledgeable about different forms of trading zones that virtual workspaces can provide and understanding the relationship between trading zones and different affordances.", "authors": [{"name": "arvind malhotra", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100086510"}, {"name": "ann majchrzak", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100415371"}], "title": "How virtual teams use their virtual workspace to coordinate knowledge", "citations": [{"Name": "Radhika Jain ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lan Cao ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kannan Mohan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Balasubramaniam Ramesh", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Juliana Sutanto ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Atreyi Kankanhalli ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bernard Cheng Yian Tan", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "James Howison ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kevin Crowston", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "A.

As the AT interface is manipulated, data stream mining techniques are used to monitor user goals. In this context, real-time data mining aids clinicians in tracking user behaviors as they attempt to achieve their goals. Quality metrics over stream-mined models identify potential changes in user goal attainment, as the user learns his or her personalized emailing system. When the quality of some data-mined models varies significantly from nearby models\u2014as defined by quality metrics\u2014the user's behavior is then flagged as a significant behavioral change. The specific changes in user behavior are then characterized by differencing the data-mined decision tree models. This article describes how model quality monitoring and decision tree differencing can aid in recognition and diagnoses of behavioral changes in a case study of cognitive rehabilitation via emailing. The technique may be more widely applicable to other real-time data-intensive analysis problems.", "authors": [{"name": "william n robinson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100187716"}, {"name": "arash akhlaghi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81458658177"}, {"name": "tianjie deng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81482653867"}, {"name": "ali raza syed", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100295228"}], "title": "Discovery and diagnosis of behavioral transitions in patient event streams", "citations": [{"Name": "Niam Yaraghi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Anna Ye Du ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Raj Sharman ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ram D.

The findings suggest that there is inefficiency in vendors\u2019 pricing decisions. Specifically, vendors do not appear to fully understand the incremental predictive power of online reviews in forecasting future sales when they adjust their prices. However, they do understand demand persistence. Interestingly, vendors reduce price if the actual demand is higher than the expected demand (positive demand shock). This phenomenon is attributed to the advertising effect suggested in previous literature and the intense competitiveness of e-Commerce. Finally, we document that vendors do not change their prices directly in response to online reviews; their response to online reviews is through forecasting consumer\u2019s future demand.", "authors": [{"name": "nan hu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100253854"}, {"name": "hasan cavusoglu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418593465"}, {"name": "ling liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81549197656"}, {"name": "chenkai ni", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81549017956"}], "title": "Do Vendors\u2019 Pricing Decisions Fully Reflect Information in Online Reviews?", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "39\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "246\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wisconsin eau claire", "city": null, "Name": "nan hu"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of british columbia", "affiliation_string": "university of british columbia", "city": "vancouver", "Name": "hasan cavusoglu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wisconsin eau claire", "city": null, "Name": "ling liu"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": "national university of singapore", "affiliation_string": "national university of singapore", "city": "singapore", "Name": "chenkai ni"}]}, "Article No.: 15": {"references": ["Angeletou, S., Sabou, M., Specia, L., and Motta, E.2007.

The objective of this work is to enable effective search and discovery of Web content using social bookmarking tags. Tags are metadata generated by users for Web content annotation. Their potential as effective Web search and discovery tool is hindered by challenges such as, the tag space being untidy due to ambiguity, and hidden or implicit semantics. Using a novel analytics approach, we conducted network analyses on tags and discovered that tags are generated for different purposes and that there are inherent relationships among tags. Our approach can be used to extract the purposes of tags and relationships among the tags and this information can be used as facets to add structure and hierarchy to reorganize the flat tag space. The semantics of relationships and hierarchy in our proposed faceted model of tags enable searches on annotated Web content in an effective manner. We describe the implementation of a prototype system called FASTS to demonstrate feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.", "authors": [{"name": "wei wei", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81549249356"}, {"name": "sudha ram", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100149968"}], "title": "Using a Network Analysis Approach for Organizing Social Bookmarking Tags and Enabling Web Content Discovery", "citations": [{"Name": "Levent V.

Instead of writing formal and lengthy messages, microbloggers prefer to frequently broadcast several short messages to be read by other users. Only when messages are interesting, are they propagated further by the readers. In this article, we examine user behavior relevant to information propagation through microblogging. We specifically use retweeting activities among Twitter users to define and modeloriginatingandpromotingbehavior. We propose a basic model for measuring the two behaviors, amutual dependencymodel, which considers the mutual relationships between the two behaviors, and arange-basedmodel, which considers thedepthandreachof users\u2019 original tweets. Next, we compare the three behavior models and contrast them with the existing work on modeling influential Twitter users.

In this article, we will discuss two design iterations of a supportive tabletop application that we built to increase process and information transparency as compared to the traditional pen and paper encounters. While the first iteration\u2019s design was \u201cenforcing\u201d transparency and therefore proved to be a failure [Nussbaumer et al. 2011], we built the second iteration on design rationales enabling more \u201ccasual\u201d transparency. Experimental evaluations show that the redesigned system significantly increases the client\u2019s perceived transparency, her perceived control of the encounter and improves her perceived trustworthiness of and satisfaction with the encounter. With these findings, we contribute to (1) insight into the role of transparency advisory encounter design; (2) design solutions for establishing particular facets of transparency and their potential instantiations in tabletop systems; and (3) insight into the process of designing for transparency with socio-technical artifacts that are emergent as a result of design activities.", "authors": [{"name": "philipp nussbaumer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81488641279"}, {"name": "inu matter", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81488667429"}, {"name": "gerhard schwabe", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100468229"}], "title": "\u201cEnforced\u201d vs. \u201cCasual\u201d Transparency -- Findings from IT-Supported Financial Advisory Encounters", "citations": [{"Name": "Susanna Heyman ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Henrik Artman", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tobias Giesbrecht ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tino Comes ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gerhard Schwabe", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Back in Sight", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "41\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "231\n", "Citation Count": "4\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "switzerland", "university": "university of zurich", "affiliation_string": "university of zurich", "city": "zurich", "Name": "philipp nussbaumer"}, {"country": "switzerland", "university": "university of zurich", "affiliation_string": "university of zurich", "city": "zurich", "Name": "inu matter"}, {"country": "switzerland", "university": "university of zurich", "affiliation_string": "university of zurich", "city": "zurich", "Name": "gerhard schwabe"}]}, "Article No.: 8": {"references": ["Abdolvand, N., Albadvi, A., and Ferdowsi, Z.2008.

Since each partner has its own internal processes with different control flow structures and message interfaces, the real challenge lies in verifying the correctness of process collaboration, and reconciling conflicts in an automated manner to make collaboration successful. The purpose of business process adaptation is to mediate the communication between independent processes to overcome their mismatches and incompatibilities. The goal of this article is to develop and compare efficient approaches of optimal adapter (i.e. one that minimizes the number of messages to be adapted) creation for multiple interacting processes under both synchronous and asynchronous communication. We start with an analysis of interactions of each message pair, and show how to identify incompatible cases and their adaptation elements for both types of communication. Then, we show how to extend this analysis into more general cases involvingMmessages andNprocesses (M, N> 2). Further, we present optimal adapter creation algorithms for both scenarios based on our analysis technique. The algorithms were implemented in a Java-based prototype system, and results of two experiments are reported. We compare and discuss the insights gained about adapter creation in these two scenarios.", "authors": [{"name": "zhe shan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100400898"}, {"name": "akhil kumar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100384061"}], "title": "Optimal Adapter Creation for Process Composition in Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Communication", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "43\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "271\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "school of business manhattan college", "city": "manhattan", "Name": "zhe shan"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "smeal college of business penn state university", "city": null, "Name": "akhil kumar"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Ahmed Abbasi , Hsinchun Chen, CyberGate: a design framework and system for text analysis of computer-mediated communication, MIS Quarterly, v.32 n.4, p.811-837, December 2008\n", "Ahmed Abbasi , Hsinchun Chen , Arab Salem, Sentiment analysis in multiple languages: Feature selection for opinion classification in Web forums, ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS), v.26 n.3, p.1-34, June 2008[doi>10.1145/1361684.1361685]\n", "Stefano Baccianella , Andrea Esuli , Fabrizio Sebastiani, Multi-facet Rating of Product Reviews, Proceedings of the 31th European Conference on IR Research on Advances in Information Retrieval, April 06-09, 2009, Toulouse, France[doi>10.1007/978-3-642-00958-7_41]\n", "Chih-Chung Chang , Chih-Jen Lin, LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines, ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST), v.2 n.3, p.1-27, April 2011[doi>10.1145/1961189.1961199]\n", "Hsinchun Chen , David Zimbra, AI and Opinion Mining, IEEE Intelligent Systems, v.25 n.3, p.74-80, May 2010[doi>10.1109/MIS.2010.75]\n", "Yubo Chen , Jinhong Xie, Online Consumer Review: Word-of-Mouth as a New Element of Marketing Communication Mix, Management Science, v.54 n.3, p.477-491, March 2008[doi>10.1287/mnsc.1070.0810]\n", "Wingyan Chung , Hsinchun Chen , Jay F.

The sheer volume of customer reviews on the web produces information overload for readers. Developing a system that can automatically identify the most helpful reviews would be valuable to businesses that are interested in gathering informative and meaningful customer feedback. Because the target variable---review helpfulness---is continuous, common feature selection techniques from text classification cannot be applied. In this article, we propose and investigate a text mining model, enhanced using the Regressional ReliefF (RReliefF) feature selection method, for predicting the helpfulness of online reviews from Amazon.com. We find that RReliefF significantly outperforms two popular dimension reduction methods. This study is the first to investigate and compare different dimension reduction techniques in the context of applying text regression for predicting online review helpfulness. Another contribution is that our analysis of the keywords selected by RReliefF reveals meaningful feature groupings.", "authors": [{"name": "thomas l ngo-ye", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81504687724"}, {"name": "atish p sinha", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100335914"}], "title": "Analyzing Online Review Helpfulness Using a Regressional ReliefF-Enhanced Text Mining Method", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "124\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "14\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "637\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "dalton state college", "city": null, "Name": "thomas l ngo-ye"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wisconsin-milwaukee", "city": null, "Name": "atish p sinha"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["A.

Classical data mining techniques such as classification, clustering, regression, association rule learning, and sequence/episode mining do not focus on business process models and are often only used to analyze a specific step in the overall process. Process mining focuses on end-to-end processes and is possible because of the growing availability of event data and new process discovery and conformance checking techniques.Process models are used foranalysis(e.g., simulation and verification) andenactmentby BPM/WFM systems. Previously, process models were typically made by hand without using event data. However, activities executed by people, machines, and software leave trails in so-calledevent logs. Process mining techniques use such logs to discover, analyze, and improve business processes.Recently, the Task Force on Process Mining released the Process Mining Manifesto. This manifesto is supported by 53 organizations and 77 process mining experts contributed to it. The active involvement of end-users, tool vendors, consultants, analysts, and researchers illustrates the growing significance of process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling. The practical relevance of process mining and the interesting scientific challenges make process mining one of the \u201chot\u201d topics in Business Process Management (BPM). This article introduces process mining as a new research field and summarizes the guiding principles and challenges described in the manifesto.", "authors": [{"name": "wil van der aalst", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81496661734"}], "title": "Process Mining: Overview and Opportunities", "citations": [{"Name": "Jae Choi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Derek L.

Typical discrete choice models that are targeted at providing an understanding of the behavioral process leading to choice outcomes are developed around two main assumptions: the existence of a utility function that represents the preferences over a choice set and the relatively simple and interpretable functional form for the utility function with respect to attributes of alternatives and decision makers. These assumptions lead to models that can be easily interpreted to provide insights into the effects of individual variables, such as price and promotion, on consumer choices. However, these restrictive assumptions might impede the ability of such theory-driven models to deliver accurate predictions and forecasts. In this article, we develop novel approaches targeted at providing more accurate choice predictions. Specifically, we propose two prediction-driven approaches: pairwise preference learning using classification techniques and ranking function learning using evolutionary computation. We compare our proposed approaches with a multiclass classification approach, as well as a standard discrete choice model. Our empirical results show that the proposed approaches achieved significantly higher choice prediction accuracy.", "authors": [{"name": "zan huang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351599463"}, {"name": "huimin zhao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100535807"}, {"name": "dan zhu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350573781"}], "title": "Two New Prediction-Driven Approaches to Discrete Choice Prediction", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "44\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "296\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "pennsylvania state university", "city": null, "Name": "zan huang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wisconsin-milwaukee", "city": null, "Name": "huimin zhao"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "iowa state university", "city": null, "Name": "dan zhu"}]}}, "date": {"month": "July", "year": "2012"}}}, "Volume6": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Article No.: 15": {"references": ["Swarup Acharya , Rafael Alonso , Michael Franklin , Stanley Zdonik, Broadcast disks: data management for asymmetric communication environments, ACM SIGMOD Record, v.24 n.2, p.199-210, May 1995[doi>10.1145/568271.223816]\n", "Gediminas Adomavicius , Jingjing Zhang, Impact of data characteristics on recommender systems performance, ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems (TMIS), v.3 n.1, p.1-17, April 2012[doi>10.1145/2151163.2151166]\n", "Mohammad Yahya H.

Furthermore, passive optical networks are expected to extend the reachability of high-quality push services to thousands of clients. The efficiency of a push service is the ratio of successfully informed users. However, pushing only data of high popularity can degrade the thematic coherency of the content. The present work offers a novel, analysis-derived, tunable way for selecting data for push services. The proposed scheme can maximize the service ratio of a push system with regard to data coherence constraints. Extensive simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the scheme compared to alternative solutions. The proposed scheme is the first to tackle the problem of data coherence-aware, service ratio optimization of push services.", "authors": [{"name": "christos liaskos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81488672576"}, {"name": "ageliki tsioliaridou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81312483719"}], "title": "Service Ratio-Optimal, Content Coherence-Aware Data Push Systems", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "38\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "12\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "38\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Greece", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "foundation of research and technology - hellas crete greece", "city": "crete", "Name": "christos liaskos"}, {"country": "greece", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "democritus university of thrace xanthi greece", "city": null, "Name": "ageliki tsioliaridou"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["F.

In particular, we hypothesize that peripheral developer participation is higher when the potential for building reputation by gaining recognition from project stakeholders is higher. We consider recognition byinternalstakeholders (such as core developers) andexternalstakeholders (such as end-users and peers). We find a positive association between peripheral developer participation and the potential of stakeholder recognition after controlling for bug reports, feature requests, and other key factors.

Network attackers, or Botmasters, use Botnet to launch the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) to paralyze large-scale websites or steal confidential data from infected computers. They also employ \u201cphishing\u201d attacks to steal sensitive information (such as users\u2019 accounts and passwords), send bulk email advertising, and/or conduct click fraud. Even though detection technology has been much improved and some solutions to Internet security have been proposed and improved, the threat of Botnet still exists. Most of the past studies dealing with this issue used either packet contents or traffic flow characteristics to identify the invasion of Botnet. However, there still exist many problems in the areas of packet encryption and data privacy, simply because Botnet can easily change the packet contents and flow characteristics to circumvent the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). This study combines Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and K-means algorithms to provide a solution to remedy those problems and develop, step by step, a mechanism for Botnet detection. First, three important network behaviors are identified: long active communication behavior (ActBehavior), connection failure behavior (FailBehavior), and network scanning behavior (ScanBehavior). These behaviors are defined according to the relevant prior studies and used to analyze the communication activities among the infected computers. Second, the features of network behaviors are extracted from the flow traces in the network layer and transport layer of the network equipment. Third, PSO and K-means techniques are used to uncover the host members of Botnet in the organizational network. This study mainly utilizes the flow traces of a campus network as an experiment. The experimental findings show that this proposed approach can be employed to detect the suspicious Botnet members earlier than the detection application systems. In addition, this proposed approach is easy to implement and can be further used and extended in the campus dormitory network, home networks, and the mobile 3G network.", "authors": [{"name": "shing-han li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658699120"}, {"name": "yu-cheng kao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81365596536"}, {"name": "zong-cyuan zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658701077"}, {"name": "ying-ping chuang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658706695"}, {"name": "david c yen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=86159236957"}], "title": "A Network Behavior-Based Botnet Detection Mechanism Using PSO and K-means", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "365\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "33\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "365\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "taiwan", "university": "national taipei university", "affiliation_string": "department of accounting information national taipei university of business taipei taiwan", "city": "taibei", "Name": "shing-han li"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "tatung university ", "affiliation_string": "department of information management tatung university taipei taiwan", "city": "taibei", "Name": "yu-cheng kao"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "tatung university ", "affiliation_string": "department of information management tatung university taipei taiwan", "city": "taibei", "Name": "zong-cyuan zhang"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "tatung university ", "affiliation_string": "department of information management tatung university taipei taiwan", "city": "taibei", "Name": "ying-ping chuang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "school of economics and business suny college at oneonta department of information systems and analytics oneonta ny", "city": null, "Name": "david c yen"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["Sumeet Agarwal , Shantanu Godbole , Diwakar Punjani , Shourya Roy, How Much Noise Is Too Much: A Study in Automatic Text Classification, Proceedings of the 2007 Seventh IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, p.3-12, October 28-31, 2007[doi>10.1109/ICDM.2007.21]\n", "H.

Traditional lexicon-based approaches depend on document content analysis and measure overlap of the feature vectors representing different documents, which cannot effectively address word mismatch or ambiguity problems. Alternative query expansion and local context discovery approaches are developed but suffer from limited efficiency and effectiveness, because the large number of expanded terms create noise and increase the dimensionality and complexity of the overall feature space. Several techniques extend lexicon-based analysis by incorporating latent semantic indexing but produce less comprehensible clustering results and questionable performance. We instead propose a concept-based document representation and clustering (CDRC) technique and empirically examine its effectiveness using 433 articles concerning information systems and technology, randomly selected from a popular digital library. Our evaluation includes two widely used benchmark techniques and shows that CDRC outperforms them. Overall, our results reveal that clustering documents at an ontology-based, concept-based level is more effective than techniques using lexicon-based document features and can generate more comprehensible clustering results.", "authors": [{"name": "yen-hsien lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100386172"}, {"name": "paul jen-hwa hu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451594712"}, {"name": "ching-yi tu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658689242"}], "title": "Ontology-Based Mapping for Automated Document Management: A Concept-Based Technique for Word Mismatch and Ambiguity Problems in Document Clustering", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "136\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "17\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "170\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "taiwan", "university": "national chiayi university", "affiliation_string": "national chiayi university", "city": "jiayi", "Name": "yen-hsien lee"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of utah", "city": null, "Name": "paul jen-hwa hu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ase group kaohsiung", "city": null, "Name": "ching-yi tu"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Ahmed Abbasi , Hsinchun Chen, Writeprints: A stylometric approach to identity-level identification and similarity detection in cyberspace, ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS), v.26 n.2, p.1-29, March 2008[doi>10.1145/1344411.1344413]\n", "Ahmed Abbasi , Hsinchun Chen, CyberGate: a design framework and system for text analysis of computer-mediated communication, MIS Quarterly, v.32 n.4, p.811-837, December 2008\n", "Ahmed Abbasi , Hsinchun Chen , Arab Salem, Sentiment analysis in multiple languages: Feature selection for opinion classification in Web forums, ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS), v.26 n.3, p.1-34, June 2008[doi>10.1145/1361684.1361685]\n", "H.

Prior analyses of firm-related forums have considered all participants in the aggregate, failing to recognize the potential for diversity within the populations. However, distinctive groups of forum participants may represent various interests and stakes in a firm worthy of consideration. To perform the stakeholder analyses, the Stakeholder Analyzer system for firm-related web forums is developed following the design science paradigm of information systems research. The design of the system and its approach to stakeholder analysis is guided by two kernel theories, the stakeholder theory of the firm and the systemic functional linguistic theory. A stakeholder analysis identifies distinctive groups of forum participants with shared characteristics expressed in discussion and evaluates their specific opinions and interests in the firm. Stakeholder analyses are performed in six major firm-related forums hosted on Yahoo Finance over a 3-month period. The relationships between measures extracted from the forums and subsequent daily firm stock returns are examined using multiple linear regression models, revealing statistically significant indicators of firm stock returns in the discussions of the stakeholder groups of each firm with stakeholder-model-adjusted R2values reaching 0.83. Daily stock return prediction is also performed for 31 trading days, and stakeholder models correctly predicted the direction of return on 67&percnt; of trading days and generated an impressive 17&percnt; return in simulated trading of the six firm stocks. These evaluations demonstrate that the stakeholder analyses provided more refined assessments of the firm-related forums, yielding measures at the stakeholder group level that better explain and predict daily firm stock returns than aggregate forum-level information.", "authors": [{"name": "david zimbra", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81464671735"}, {"name": "hsinchun chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452604957"}, {"name": "robert f lusch", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81326491071"}], "title": "Stakeholder Analyses of Firm-Related Web Forums: Applications in Stock Return Prediction", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "159\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "15\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "159\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Cuba", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "santa clara university santa clara ca usa", "city": "santa clara", "Name": "david zimbra"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of arizona tucson az usa", "city": "arizona", "Name": "hsinchun chen"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of arizona tucson az usa", "city": "arizona", "Name": "robert f lusch"}]}}, "date": {"month": "April", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Fabian Abel , Qi Gao , Geert-Jan Houben , Ke Tao, Analyzing user modeling on twitter for personalized news recommendations, Proceedings of the 19th international conference on User modeling, adaption, and personalization, July 11-15, 2011, Girona, Spain\n", "R\u00e9ka Albert and Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si. 2002.

Although substantial research on the spread of news on Twitter exists, there hasn't been much focus on the study of the spread of news articles. In this study, we present an innovative methodology involving weighted ego networks to understand how news agencies propagate news articles using their Twitter handle. We propose a set of measures to compare the propagation process of different news agencies by studying important aspects such as volume, extent of spread, conversion rate, multiplier effect, lifespan, hourly response, and audience participation. Using a dataset of tweets collected over a period of 6 months, we apply our methodology and suggest a framework to help news agencies gauge their performance on social media and also provide critical insights into the phenomenon of news article propagation on Twitter.", "authors": [{"name": "devipsita bhattacharya", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81554334556"}, {"name": "sudha ram", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100149968"}], "title": "RT &commat;News: An Analysis of News Agency Ego Networks in a Microblogging Environment", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "78\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "78\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of arizona management information systems tucson az united states", "city": "arizona", "Name": "devipsita bhattacharya"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of arizona management information systems tucson az united states", "city": "arizona", "Name": "sudha ram"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["R.

Traditional requirements engineering (RE) techniques addressing stakeholders\u2019 social interaction are mainly part of a centralized process intertwined with a specific phase of software development. However, in open-source software (OSS) development, stakeholders\u2019 social interactions are often decentralized, iterative, and dynamic. Little is known about new requirements identification in OSS and the stakeholders\u2019 organizational arrangements supporting such an activity. In this article, we investigate the theory of structural hole from the context of contributing new requirements in OSS projects. Structural hole theory suggests that stakeholders positioned in the structural holes in their social network are able to produce new ideas. In this study, we find that structural hole positions emerge in stakeholders\u2019 social network and these positions are positively related to contributing a higher number of new requirements. We find that along with structural hole positions, stakeholders\u2019 role is also an important part in identifying new requirements. We further observe that structural hole positions evolve over time, thereby identifying requirements to realize enriched features. Our work advances the fundamental understanding of the RE process in a decentralized environment and opens avenues for improved techniques supporting this process.", "authors": [{"name": "tanmay bhowmik", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474643076"}, {"name": "nan niu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100279815"}, {"name": "prachi singhania", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658744275"}, {"name": "wentao wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658743813"}], "title": "On the Role of Structural Holes in Requirements Identification: An Exploratory Study on Open-Source Software Development", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "109\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "15\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "109\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "northwest missouri state university maryville mo", "city": null, "Name": "tanmay bhowmik"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of cincinnati cincinnati oh", "city": "cincinnati", "Name": "nan niu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "mississippi state university mississippi state ms", "city": null, "Name": "prachi singhania"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of cincinnati cincinnati oh", "city": "cincinnati", "Name": "wentao wang"}]}, "Article No.: 12": {"references": ["E.

In any organization, numerous tasks have to be carried out by employees. However, due to security needs, it is not feasible to directly assign any existing task to the first available employee. In order to meet many additional security requirements, constraints such as separation of duty, cardinality and binding have to be taken into consideration. Meeting these requirements imposes extra burden on organizations, which, however, is unavoidable in order to ensure security. While a trivial way of ensuring security is to assign each user to a single task, business organizations would typically like to minimize their costs and keep staffing requirements to a minimum. To meet these contradictory goals, we define the problem of Cardinality Constrained-Mutually Exclusive Task Minimum User Problem (CMUP), which aims to find the minimum users that can carry out a set of tasks while satisfying the given security constraints. We show that the CMUP problem is equivalent to a constrained version of the weak chromatic number problem in hypergraphs, which is NP-hard. We, therefore, propose a greedy solution. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm is both efficient and effective.", "authors": [{"name": "arindam roy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658745536"}, {"name": "shamik sural", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100245662"}, {"name": "arun kumar majumdar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81460648382"}, {"name": "jaideep vaidya", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100496660"}, {"name": "vijayalakshmi atluri", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351595212"}], "title": "Minimizing Organizational User Requirement while Meeting Security Constraints", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "89\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "18\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "89\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "india", "university": "indian institute of technology kharagpur", "affiliation_string": "indian institute of technology kharagpur india", "city": "kharagpur", "Name": "arindam roy"}, {"country": "india", "university": "indian institute of technology kharagpur", "affiliation_string": "indian institute of technology kharagpur india", "city": "kharagpur", "Name": "shamik sural"}, {"country": "india", "university": "indian institute of technology kharagpur", "affiliation_string": "indian institute of technology kharagpur india", "city": "kharagpur", "Name": "arun kumar majumdar"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "rutgers university usa", "city": null, "Name": "jaideep vaidya"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "rutgers university usa", "city": null, "Name": "vijayalakshmi atluri"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["Alexander Benlian , Ryad Titah , Thomas Hess, Differential Effects of Provider Recommendations and Consumer Reviews in E-Commerce Transactions: An Experimental Study, Journal of Management Information Systems, v.29 n.1, p.237-272, Number 1 / Summer 2012[doi>10.2753/MIS0742-1222290107]\n", "John W.

The earliest and largest player is Groupon. Originally, Groupon deals were a mix of deals with a minimum requirement (MR) of coupon sales before a deal became effective and of deals without a minimum requirement (NMR). Eventually, Groupon stopped usingMRdeals. For Groupon and its retailer customers, might this decision have actually resulted in negative impacts for both parties (fewer coupons sold and lower revenue)? The structure of Groupon deals (including a \u201cFacebook like\u201d option) together with electronic access to the necessary data offered the opportunity to empirically investigate these questions. We analyzed relationships amongMR, Facebook likes (FL), quantity of coupons sold, and total revenue, performing the analysis across the four largest retail categories. Using timestamped empirical data, we completed a propensity score analysis of causal effects. We find that the presence ofMRincreases Facebook likes, quantity of coupons sold, and total revenue at the time point when theMRis met and at subsequent 2-hour intervals over the horizon of deals. A key finding is that the initial differences observed whenMRis met not only continue but also actually increase over the life of the deals.", "authors": [{"name": "xue bai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658753501"}, {"name": "james r marsden", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100366375"}, {"name": "william t ross", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658745940"}, {"name": " jr", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658753927"}], "title": "Relationships Among Minimum Requirements, Facebook Likes, and Groupon Deal Outcomes", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "124\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "27\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "124\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of connecticut school of business storrs ct", "city": null, "Name": "xue bai"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of connecticut school of business storrs ct", "city": null, "Name": "james r marsden"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "william t ross"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of connecticut school of business storrs ctgang wang", "city": null, "Name": " jr"}]}}, "date": {"month": "October", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 8": {"references": ["M.

However, there is no well-established methodology to study the dynamics of this network. Traditional approaches have primarily utilized a single source of data of relatively established firms; however, these approaches ignore the vast number of relevant activities that often occur at the individual and entrepreneurial levels. We argue that a data-driven visualization approach, using both institutionally and socially curated datasets, can provide important complementary, triangulated explanatory insights into the dynamics of interorganizational networks in general and business ecosystems in particular. We develop novel visualization layouts to help decision makers systemically identify and compare ecosystems. Using traditionally disconnected data sources on deals and alliance relationships (DARs), executive and funding relationships (EFRs), and public opinion and discourse (POD), we empirically illustrate our data-driven method of data triangulation and visualization techniques through three cases in the mobile industry Google\u2019s acquisition of Motorola Mobility, the coopetitive relation between Apple and Samsung, and the strategic partnership between Nokia and Microsoft.

Process view technology is of practical use for privacy protection and authorization control in process-oriented business management. Owing to complex organizational structure, it is challenging for large companies to accurately specify the diverse perception of different users over business processes. Aiming to tackle this issue, this article presents a role-based process view model to incorporate role dependencies into process view derivation. Compared to existing process view approaches, ours particularly supports runtime updates to the process view perceivable to a user with specific view merging operations, thereby enabling the dynamic tracing of process perception. A series of rules and theorems are established to guarantee the structural consistency and validity of process view transformation. A hypothetical case is conducted to illustrate the feasibility of our approach, and a prototype is developed for the proof-of-concept purpose.", "authors": [{"name": "xiaohui zhao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81317503488"}, {"name": "chengfei liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452598185"}, {"name": "sira yongchareon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418599725"}, {"name": "marek kowalkiewicz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100024863"}, {"name": "wasim sadiq", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100238097"}], "title": "Role-Based Process View Derivation and Composition", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "84\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "11\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "84\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "australia", "university": "university of canberra", "affiliation_string": "university of canberra canberra australia", "city": "canberra", "Name": "xiaohui zhao"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "swinburne university of technology", "affiliation_string": "swinburne university of technology melbourne australia", "city": "melbourne", "Name": "chengfei liu"}, {"country": "New Zealand", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "unitec institute of technology auckland new zealand", "city": "auckland", "Name": "sira yongchareon"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "marek kowalkiewicz"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "wasim sadiq"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Interdepartmental Interdependence and Coordination: The Case of the Design/Manufacturing Interface, Organization Science, v.6 n.2, p.147-167, April 1995[doi>10.1287/orsc.6.2.147]\n", "Hayward P.

Although various task coordination mechanisms have been proposed for such teams, there is a lack of systematic examination of the appropriate coordination mechanisms for different teams based on the nature of their task and the context under which they operate. Prior studies on collocated teams suggest matching their levels of task dependence to specific task coordination mechanisms for effective coordination. This research goes beyond the earlier work by also considering additional contextual factors of GDT (i.e., temporal dispersion and time constraints) in deriving their optimal IT-mediated task coordination mechanisms. Adopting the structural contingency theory, we propose optimal IT-mediated task coordination portfolios to fit the different levels of task dependence, temporal dispersion, and perceived time constraint of GDTs. The proposed fit is tested through a survey and profile analysis of 95 globally dispersed software development teams in a large financial organization. We find, as hypothesized, that the extent of fit between the actual IT-mediated task coordination portfolios used by the surveyed teams and their optimal portfolios proposed here is positively related to their task coordination effectiveness that in turn impacts the team's efficiency and effectiveness. The implications for theory and practice are discussed.", "authors": [{"name": "juliana sutanto", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100245424"}, {"name": "atreyi kankanhalli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100562156"}, {"name": "bernard cheng yian tan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658718058"}], "title": "Investigating Task Coordination in Globally Dispersed Teams: A Structural Contingency Perspective", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "154\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "154\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Switzerland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "eth zurich switzerland", "city": "zurich", "Name": "juliana sutanto"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": "national university of singapore", "affiliation_string": "national university of singapore singapore", "city": "singapore", "Name": "atreyi kankanhalli"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": "national university of singapore", "affiliation_string": "national university of singapore singapore", "city": "singapore", "Name": "bernard cheng yian tan"}]}}, "date": {"month": "July", "year": "2015"}}}, "Volume4": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Article No.: 19": {"references": ["Ambady, N. and Rosenthal, R. 1992.

ODVIC is a multimodal Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) that empathically delivers an evidence-based behavior change intervention by adapting, in real-time, its verbal and nonverbal communication messages to those of the user\u2019s during their interaction. We currently focus our work on excessive alcohol consumption as a target behavior, and our approach is adaptable to other target behaviors (e.g., overeating, lack of exercise, narcotic drug use, non-adherence to treatment). We based our current approach on a successful existing patient-centered brief motivational intervention for behavior change---the Drinker\u2019s Check-Up (DCU)---whose computer-delivery with a text-only interface has been found effective in reducing alcohol consumption in problem drinkers. We discuss the results of users\u2019 evaluation of the computer-based DCU intervention delivered with a text-only interface compared to the same intervention delivered with two different ECAs (a neutral one and one with some empathic abilities). Users rate the three systems in terms of acceptance, perceived enjoyment, and intention to use the system, among other dimensions. We conclude with a discussion of how our positive results encourage our long-term goals ofon-demand conversations, anytime, anywhere, with virtual agents as personal health and well-being helpers.", "authors": [{"name": "christine lisetti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100460595"}, {"name": "reza amini", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502679168"}, {"name": "ugan yasavur", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81758957757"}, {"name": "naphtali rishe", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84459097957"}], "title": "I Can Help You Change!

It finds that even before joining the incentive program, adopter hospitals had more efficient and effective Medicare operations than those of non-adopters. Adopters were also financially more efficient. After joining the program, adopter hospitals treated significantly more Medicare patients by shortening their stay durations, relative to their own non-Medicare patients and also to patients at non-adopter hospitals, even as their overall capacity utilization remained relatively unchanged. The study concludes that many of these hospitals had implemented EHR even before the initiation of the incentive program. It further infers that they joined this program with opportunistic intentions of tapping into incentive payouts which they maximized by taking on more Medicare patients. These findings give credence to critics of the program who have questioned its utility and alleged that it serves only to reward existing users of EHR technologies.", "authors": [{"name": "rajesh mirani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100425377"}, {"name": "anju harpalani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=86158924457"}], "title": "Business Benefits or Incentive Maximization?

Australia, like most of the western world, is bracing up for the looming ageing population crisis, spiraling healthcare costs, and expected serious shortage of healthcare workers. Assistive service and companion (social) robots are being seen as one of the ways for supporting aged care facilities to meet this challenge and improve the quality of care of older people including mental and physical health outcomes, as well as to support healthcare workers in personalizing care. In this article, the authors report on the design and implementation of first-ever field trials of Matilda, a human-like assistive communication (service and companion) robot for improving the emotional well-being of older people in three residential care facilities in Australia involving 70 participants. The research makes several unique contributions including Matilda\u2019s ability to break technology barriers, positively engage older people in group and one-to-one activities, making these older people productive and useful, helping them become resilient and cope better through personalization of care, and finally providing them sensory enrichment through Matilda\u2019s multimodal communication capabilities.", "authors": [{"name": "rajiv khosla", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453628155"}, {"name": "mei-tai chu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81414592954"}], "title": "Embodying Care in Matilda: An Affective Communication Robot for Emotional Wellbeing of Older People in Australian Residential Care Facilities", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "121\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "15\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "355\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "australia", "university": "la trobe university", "affiliation_string": "la trobe university", "city": "melbourne", "Name": "rajiv khosla"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "la trobe university", "affiliation_string": "la trobe university", "city": "melbourne", "Name": "mei-tai chu"}]}, "Article No.: 16": {"references": ["Alexopoulos, C., Goldsman, D., Fontanesi, J., Kopald, D., and Wilson, J.

By using the EM algorithm, the model parameters, the actual throughput, as well as the noise intensity, can be identified simultaneously. Four real-world time series collected from an emergency department in West London are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the introduced algorithm.

Given that patient care is based on a coordinated workflow, we hypothesize that care pathways can be represented as the progression of a patient through a system and introduce a strategy to model the patient\u2019s flow as a sequence of accesses defined over a graph. Elements in the sequence correspond to features associated with the access transaction (e.g., reason for access). Based on this motivation, we model patterns of patient record usage, which may indicate deviations from care workflows. We evaluate our approach using several months of data from a large academic medical center. Empirical results show that this framework finds a small portion of accesses constitute outliers from such flows. We also observe that the violation patterns deviate for different types of medical services. Analysis of our results suggests greater deviation from normal access patterns by nonclinical users. We simulate anomalies in the context of real accesses to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method for different medical services. As an illustration of the capabilities of our method, it was observed that the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the Pediatrics service was found to be 0.9166. The results suggest that our approach is competitive with, and often better than, the existing state-of-the-art in its outlier detection performance. At the same time, our method is more efficient, by orders of magnitude, than previous approaches, allowing for detection of thousands of accesses in seconds.", "authors": [{"name": "he zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=86159126357"}, {"name": "sanjay mehotra", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=86158734457"}, {"name": "david liebovitz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81488668413"}, {"name": "carl a gunter", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100274423"}, {"name": "bradley malin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100445707"}], "title": "Mining Deviations from Patient Care Pathways via Electronic Medical Record System Audits", "citations": [{"Name": "You Chen ", "Country": "mali", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Joydeep Ghosh ", "Country": "mali", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Cosmin Adrian Bejan ", "Country": "mali", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Carl A.

One of the primary vehicles for achieving organizational agility is the use of agile information systems [IS] and the close alignment of information technologies [IT] with business. However, IS is often viewed as an impediment to organization agility. Recently, service-oriented architecture [SOA] has emerged as a prominent IS agility-enhancing technology. The fundamental question of how SOA can enhance organization agility and foster closer alignment between IT and business has not been adequately addressed. The dynamic interaction among external business environmental factors, organizational agility, and IS architecture makes the process of keeping IT and business aligned more complex. This study uses a design science approach to build a system dynamics model to examine the effect of employing alternative SOA implementation strategies in various organizational and external business environments on the IT business alignment and IS cost. The results provide insights into the shaping of IT-business alignment. Additionally, the system dynamics model serves as a tool for supporting managerial decisions related to SOA implementation.", "authors": [{"name": "jae choi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81557751156"}, {"name": "derek l nazareth", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81410594993"}, {"name": "hemant k jain", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100110213"}], "title": "The Impact of SOA Implementation on IT-Business Alignment: A System Dynamics Approach", "citations": [{"Name": "John Leslie King ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Carl P.

In this research we study the interlinked network effects between two different groups of physicians -- primary care physicians and specialists -- as significant factors in increasing the growth of each group in an exchange. An analytical model of interlinked and intragroup influences on adoption is developed using the Bass diffusion model as a basis. Adoption data on 1,060 different primary and secondary care physicians over 32 consecutive months was used to test the model. The results indicate not only the presence of interlinked effects, but also that their influence is stronger than that of the intragroup. Further, the influence of primary care physicians on specialists is stronger than that of specialists on primary care physicians. We also provide statistical evidence that the new model performs better than the conventional Bass model, and the assumptions of diffusion symmetry in the market are statistically valid. Together, the findings provide important guidelines on triggers that enhance the overall growth of HIE and potential marketing strategies for HIE services.", "authors": [{"name": "niam yaraghi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81556475656"}, {"name": "anna ye du", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100306562"}, {"name": "raj sharman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81327491400"}, {"name": "ram d gopal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100588455"}, {"name": "r ramesh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452609727"}], "title": "Network Effects in Health Information Exchange Growth", "citations": [{"Name": "Niam Yaraghi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Anna Ye Du ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Raj Sharman ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ram D.

These messages are logged in electronic documents called incident reports, which are useful in monitoring the incident, off-site supervision, resource allocation, and post-incident analysis. However, these messages do not adhere to any particular structure, and there is no set format. The lack of standards creates a problem for sharing information among systems and responders and has a detrimental impact on systems interoperability.

Use of video raises obvious privacy concerns. Several privacy enhancements have been proposed such as modifying a person in video by introducing blur, silhouette, or bounding-box. Person extraction is fundamental in video-based assistive monitoring and degraded in the presence of privacy enhancements; however, privacy enhancements have characteristics that can opportunistically be adapted to. We propose two adaptive algorithms for improving assistive monitoring goal performance with privacy-enhanced video: specific-color hunter and edge-void filler. A nonadaptive algorithm, foregrounding, is used as the default algorithm for the adaptive algorithms. We compare nonadaptive and adaptive algorithms with 5 common privacy enhancements on the effectiveness of 8 automated monitoring goals. The nonadaptive algorithm performance on privacy-enhanced video is degraded from raw video. However, adaptive algorithms can compensate for the degradation. Energy estimation accuracy in our tests degraded from 90.9&percnt; to 83.9&percnt;, but the adaptive algorithms significantly compensated by bringing the accuracy up to 87.1&percnt;. Similarly, fall detection accuracy degraded from 1.0 sensitivity to 0.86 and from 1.0 specificity to 0.79, but the adaptive algorithms compensated accuracy back to 0.92 sensitivity and 0.90 specificity. Additionally, the adaptive algorithms were computationally more efficient than the nonadaptive algorithm, averaging 1.7&percnt; more frames processed per second.", "authors": [{"name": "alex edgcomb", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490694170"}, {"name": "frank vahid", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100400980"}], "title": "Accurate and Efficient Algorithms that Adapt to Privacy-Enhanced Video for Improved Assistive Monitoring", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "44\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "113\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Trinidad and Tobago", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california riverside", "city": "california", "Name": "alex edgcomb"}, {"country": "Trinidad and Tobago", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california riverside", "city": "california", "Name": "frank vahid"}]}, "Article No.: 12": {"references": ["Priscilla A.

However, for such rare conditions, there will be a huge imbalance in classes among the relevant base population. Due to regulations and privacy concerns, collecting data from other hospitals will be problematic. Consequently, distributed decision support systems that can use just the statistics of data from multiple hospitals are valuable. We present a system that can collectively build a distributed classification model dynamically without the need of patient data from each site in the case of imbalanced data. The system uses a voting ensemble of experts for the decision model. The imbalance condition and number of experts can be determined by the system. Since only statistics of the data and no raw data are required by the system, patient privacy issues are addressed. We demonstrate the outlined principles using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. Results of experiments conducted on 7,810,762 patients from 1050 hospitals show improvement of 13.68&percnt; to 24.46&percnt; in balanced prediction accuracy using our model over the baseline model, illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.", "authors": [{"name": "george mathew", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81484652854"}, {"name": "zoran obradovic", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100041040"}], "title": "Distributed Privacy-Preserving Decision Support System for Highly Imbalanced Clinical Data", "citations": [{"Name": "Yan Li ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Changxin Bai ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chandan K.

However, these standard tests do not directly indicate signs of most lifestyle diseases. In order to detect such diseases, a number of additional specific clinical tests are required, which increase the cost of the health check-up. This study aims to enrich our understanding of the common health check-ups and proposes a way to estimate the signs of several lifestyle diseases based on the standard tests in common examinations without performing any additional specific tests. In this manner, we enable a diagnostic process, where the physician may prefer to perform or avoid a costly test according to the estimation carried out through a set of common affordable tests. To that end, the relation between standard and specific test results is modeled with a multivariate kernel density estimate. The condition of the patient regarding a specific test is assessed following a Bayesian framework. Our results indicate that the proposed method achieves an overall estimation accuracy of 84&percnt;. In addition, an outstanding estimation accuracy is achieved for a subset of high-cost tests. Moreover, comparison with standard artificial intelligence methods suggests that our algorithm outperforms the conventional methods.Our contributions are as follows: (i) promotion of affordable health check-ups, (ii) high estimation accuracy in certain tests, (iii) generalization capability due to ease of implementation on different platforms and institutions, (iv) flexibility to apply to various tests and potential to improve early detection rates.", "authors": [{"name": "masato sakata", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84459000257"}, {"name": "zeynep yucel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81443598070"}, {"name": "kazuhiko shinozawa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100649131"}, {"name": "norihiro hagita", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84458669057"}, {"name": "michita imai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100282909"}, {"name": "michiko furutani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384612059"}, {"name": "rumiko matsuoka", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81318495394"}], "title": "An Inference Engine for Estimating Outside States of Clinical Test Items", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "41\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "114\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "masato sakata"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "zeynep yucel"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "kazuhiko shinozawa"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "norihiro hagita"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "keio university", "affiliation_string": "advanced telecommunications research institute and keio university", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "michita imai"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "tokyo womens medical university", "city": null, "Name": "michiko furutani"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "toho university", "affiliation_string": "tokyo womens medical university and toho university", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "rumiko matsuoka"}]}}, "date": {"month": "October", "year": "2013"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 9": {"references": ["Aamodt, M.

This article investigates several metrics as predictors of deception in synchronous chat-based environments, where participants must often spontaneously formulate deceptive responses. Based on cognitive load theory, we hypothesize that deception influences response time, word count, lexical diversity, and the number of times a chat message is edited. Using a custom chatbot to conduct interviews in an experiment, we collected 1,572 deceitful and 1,590 truthful chat-based responses. The results of the experiment confirm that deception is positively correlated with response time and the number of edits and negatively correlated to word count. Contrary to our prediction, we found that deception is not significantly correlated with lexical diversity. Furthermore, the age of the participant moderates the influence of deception on response time. Our results have implications for understanding deceit in chat-based communication and building deception-detection decision aids in chat-based systems.", "authors": [{"name": "douglas c derrick", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81464642799"}, {"name": "thomas o meservy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100156720"}, {"name": "jeffrey l jenkins", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81447596037"}, {"name": "judee k burgoon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100139378"}, {"name": "jay f nunamaker", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452618152"}], "title": "Detecting Deceptive Chat-Based Communication Using Typing Behavior and Message Cues", "citations": [{"Name": "Jackson Feij\u00f3 Filho ", "Country": "finland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Thiago Valle ", "Country": "finland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wilson Prata", "Country": "finland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Exploring non-verbal communications in mobile text chat: emotion-enhanced chat", "Country": "finland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jackson Feij\u00f3 Filho ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Thiago Valle ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wilson Prata", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Suprateek Sarker ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Suranjan Chakraborty ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Patriya Silpakit Tansuhaj ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mark Mulder ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kivilcim Dogerlioglu-Demir", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "96\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "12\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "440\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of nebraska at omaha", "city": null, "Name": "douglas c derrick"}, {"country": "Uruguay", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "brigham young university", "city": "young", "Name": "thomas o meservy"}, {"country": "Uruguay", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "brigham young university", "city": "young", "Name": "jeffrey l jenkins"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of arizona", "city": null, "Name": "judee k burgoon"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of arizona", "city": null, "Name": "jay f nunamaker jr"}]}, "Article No.: 8": {"references": ["Gediminas Adomavicius , Alexander Tuzhilin, Toward the Next Generation of Recommender Systems: A Survey of the State-of-the-Art and Possible Extensions, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, v.17 n.6, p.734-749, June 2005[doi>10.1109/TKDE.2005.99]\n", "Gediminas Adomavicius , Jingjing Zhang, Impact of data characteristics on recommender systems performance, ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems (TMIS), v.3 n.1, p.1-17, April 2012[doi>10.1145/2151163.2151166]\n", "Marko Balabanovi\u0107 , Yoav Shoham, Fab: content-based, collaborative recommendation, Communications of the ACM, v.40 n.3, p.66-72, March 1997[doi>10.1145/245108.245124]\n", "Chumki Basu , Haym Hirsh , William Cohen, Recommendation as classification: using social and content-based information in recommendation, Proceedings of the fifteenth national/tenth conference on Artificial intelligence/Innovative applications of artificial intelligence, p.714-720, July 1998, Madison, Wisconsin, USA\n", "Alejandro Bellogin , Pablo Castells , Ivan Cantador, Self-adjusting hybrid recommenders based on social network analysis, Proceedings of the 34th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in Information Retrieval, July 24-28, 2011, Beijing, China[doi>10.1145/2009916.2010092]\n", "Bogers, T. 2010.

Tags contributed by users to annotate a variety of Web resources or items provide a new type of information that can be exploited by recommender systems. Nevertheless, the sparsity of the ternary interaction data among users, items, and tags limits the performance of tag-based recommendation algorithms. In this article, we propose to deal with the sparsity problem in social tagging by applying random walks on ternary interaction graphs to explore transitive associations between users and items. The transitive associations in this article refer to the path of the link between any two nodes whose length is greater than one. Taking advantage of these transitive associations can allow more accurate measurement of the relevance between two entities (e.g., user-item, user-user, and item-item). A PageRank-like algorithm has been developed to explore these transitive associations by spreading users\u2019 preferences on an item similarity graph and spreading items\u2019 influences on a user similarity graph. Empirical evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates that our approach can effectively alleviate the sparsity problem and improve the quality of item recommendation.", "authors": [{"name": "zhu zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82658919557"}, {"name": "daniel d zeng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81311485908"}, {"name": "ahmed abbasi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350596005"}, {"name": "jing peng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82659062957"}, {"name": "xiaolong zheng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82658867957"}], "title": "A Random Walk Model for Item Recommendation in Social Tagging Systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Fatima Mourchid ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mohamed El Koutbi", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fatima Mourchid ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mohamed El Koutbi", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiangnan He ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tao Chen ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Min-Yen Kan ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiao Chen", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "102\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "382\n", "Citation Count": "4\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "chinese academy of sciences", "city": null, "Name": "zhu zhang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "chinese academy of sciences and university of arizona", "city": null, "Name": "daniel d zeng"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of virginia", "city": null, "Name": "ahmed abbasi"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of pennsylvania", "city": null, "Name": "jing peng"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "chinese academy of sciences", "city": null, "Name": "xiaolong zheng"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Niek Althuizen , Astrid Reichel , Berend Wierenga, Help that is not recognized: Harmful neglect of decision support systems, Decision Support Systems, v.54 n.1, p.719-728, December, 2012[doi>10.1016/j.dss.2012.08.016]\n", "Amit, R. and Schoemaker, P.

Although anecdotal evidence and individual case studies suggest that effective knowledge management initiatives contribute to superior firm performance, other kinds of empirical investigations are scarce, and more to the point, most of them are based on perceptions of survey participants embedded in the firms being studied. Moreover, studies analyzing the question of whether superior KM performance can predict superior market-based valuation appear to be virtually nonexistent. Findings of such studies would be of value to those who champion and direct a firm\u2019s KM efforts, and to the firm\u2019s strategists, planners, and operational managers. Here, we empirically examine the relationship between KM performance and firm valuation; the former is assessed by international panels of independent KM experts and the latter is evaluated in terms of market-based measures. Based on data spanning eight years, the results show that superior KM performance has a statistically significant positive association with firm valuation in terms of Tobin\u2019sq, price-to-book ratio, and price-to-sales ratio. This study contributes to the management literature by using independent expert judges and archival data to substantiate the notion that KM competencies are an important ingredient in a firm\u2019s performance as indicated by market-based valuation.", "authors": [{"name": "jiming wu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452594189"}, {"name": "clyde w holsapple", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490653745"}], "title": "Does Knowledge Management Matter?

Social Networks and Online Communities enable interaction with complete strangers, and open up new commercial, political, and social possibilities. But those promises are rarely achieved because it is difficult to trust the online contacts. A common approach to remedy this problem is to compute trust values for the new contacts from the existing trust values in the network. There are two main methods: aggregation and transitivity. Yet, neither method provides satisfactory results because trust networks are sparse and transitivity may not hold. This article develops a Bayesian formulation of the problem, where trust is defined as a conditional probability, and a Bayesian Network analysis is employed to compute the unknown trust values in terms of the known trust values. The algorithms used to propagate conditional probabilities through the network are theoretically sound and based on a long-standing literature on probability propagation in Bayesian networks. Moreover, the context information that is typically ignored in trust literature is included here as a major factor in computing new trust values. These changes have led to significant improvements over existing approaches in the accuracy of computed trust, and with some modifications to the algorithm, in its reach. Real data acquired from Advogato network is used to do extensive testing, and the results confirm the practical value of a theoretically sound Bayesian approach.", "authors": [{"name": "levent v orman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332519487"}], "title": "Bayesian Inference in Trust Networks", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "88\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "316\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cornell university", "city": null, "Name": "levent v orman"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Rakesh Agrawal , Tomasz Imieli\u0144ski , Arun Swami, Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases, Proceedings of the 1993 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data, p.207-216, May 25-28, 1993, Washington, D.C., USA[doi>10.1145/170035.170072]\n", "Alexander, C. 1964.Notes on the Synthesis of Form, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA.\n", "Ariely, D. 2007.Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces that Shape Our Decisions, Harper Perennial, New York, NY.\n", "Ariely, D. 2010.The Upside of Irrationality: The Unexpected Benefits of Defying Logic at Work and at Home, Harper Collins, New York, NY.\n", "Burris, S. 2010.

To address the issue of protecting organizations\u2019 competitive knowledge and private information while also enabling business-to-business (B2B) collaboration, past research has focused mainly on customized public and private process design, as well as structural correctness of the integrated workflow. However, a dataflow perspective is important for business process integration. This article presents a data-flow perspective using workflow management and mathematical techniques to address data exchange problems in independent multistakeholder business process integration in dynamic circumstances. The research is conducted following a design science paradigm. We build artifacts that include interorganizational workflow concepts, a workflow model, and a public dataset calculation method. The use of the proposed artifacts is illustrated by applying them to a real-world case in the Shenzhen (Chaiwan) port. The utility of the artifacts is evaluated through interviews with practitioners in industry. We conclude that this research complements the control-flow perspective in the interorganizational workflow management area and also contributes to B2B information-sharing literature; further, the dataflow formalism can help practitioners to formally provide the right data at the right time in dynamic circumstances.", "authors": [{"name": "xitong guo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81508689076"}, {"name": "sherry x sun", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81414592870"}, {"name": "doug vogel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81458649388"}], "title": "A Dataflow Perspective for Business Process Integration", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "110\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "11\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "219\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "china", "university": "harbin institute of technology", "affiliation_string": "harbin institute of technology harbin prc", "city": "harbin", "Name": "xitong guo"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "city university", "affiliation_string": "city university of hong kong kowloon hong kong prc", "city": "london", "Name": "sherry x sun"}, {"country": "china", "university": "harbin institute of technology", "affiliation_string": "harbin institute of technology harbin prc", "city": "harbin", "Name": "doug vogel"}]}, "Article No.: 25": {"references": ["Rebecca Angeles. 2005.

However, because of the phenomenon of false-positive reads, RFID data streams resemble noisy analog measurements rather than the desired recordings of activities within a business process. The present study investigates the use of data mining techniques for filtering and aggregating raw RFID data. We consider classifiers based on logistic regression, decision trees, and artificial neural networks using attributes derived from low-level reader data. In addition, we present a custom-made algorithm for generating decision rules using artificial attributes and an iterative training procedure. We evaluate the classifiers using a massive set of data on pallet movements collected under real-world conditions at one of the largest retailers worldwide. The results clearly indicate high classification performance of the classification models, with the rule-based classifier outperforming all others. Moreover, we show that utilizing the full spectrum of data generated by the reader hardware leads to superior performance compared with the approaches based on timestamp and antenna information proposed in prior research.", "authors": [{"name": "thorben keller", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658993448"}, {"name": "frederic thiesse", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81336493391"}, {"name": "elgar fleisch", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100308398"}], "title": "Classification Models for RFID-Based Real-Time Detection of Process Events in the Supply Chain: An Empirical Study", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "149\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "16\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "241\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "switzerland", "university": "university of st gallen", "affiliation_string": "university of st gallen st gallen switzerland", "city": "saint gall", "Name": "thorben keller"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wuerzburg wurzburg germany", "city": "wurzburg", "Name": "frederic thiesse"}, {"country": "switzerland", "university": "university of st gallen", "affiliation_string": "university of st gallen  eth zurich switzerland", "city": "saint gall", "Name": "elgar fleisch"}]}, "Article No.: 23": {"references": ["Huib Aldewereld , Javier Vazquez-Salceda , Frank Dignum , John-Jules Ch.

Regulatory compliance is important for the safety of individual actors as well as the overall business environment. However, complexity derives from not only the contents of the regulations but also their interdependencies. As such, the verification of whether actors are able to comply with the combined regulations cannot be done by checking each regulation separately.To these ends, we introduce a normative structureNorm Nets(NNs) for modeling sets of interrelated regulations and setting a basis for compliance checking of organizational interactions against interrelated regulations. NNs support a modular design by providing the constructs to represent regulations and the relationships between them. Additionally, we propose a computational mechanism to reason about regulatory compliance by mapping NNs toColored Petri Nets(CPNs). We show that compliance checking of both individual actors\u2019 behavior and the collective behavior of the business environment can be achieved automatically using state space analysis techniques of CPNs. The approach is illustrated with a case study from the domain of international trade.", "authors": [{"name": "jie jiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490646332"}, {"name": "huib aldewereld", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100078296"}, {"name": "virginia dignum", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100627426"}, {"name": "yao-hua tan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100314955"}], "title": "Compliance Checking of Organizational Interactions", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "66\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "107\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "netherlands", "university": "delft university of technology", "affiliation_string": "delft university of technology netherlands", "city": "delft", "Name": "jie jiang"}, {"country": "netherlands", "university": "delft university of technology", "affiliation_string": "delft university of technology netherlands", "city": "delft", "Name": "huib aldewereld"}, {"country": "netherlands", "university": "delft university of technology", "affiliation_string": "delft university of technology netherlands", "city": "delft", "Name": "virginia dignum"}, {"country": "netherlands", "university": "delft university of technology", "affiliation_string": "delft university of technology netherlands", "city": "delft", "Name": "yao-hua tan"}]}, "Article No.: 18e": {"references": ["Wil M.

The recent attention for Big Data illustrates that organizations are aware of the potential of the torrents of data generated by today's information systems. However, at the same time, organizations are struggling to extract value from this overload of data. Clearly, there is a need for data scientists able to transform event data into actionable information. To do this, it is crucial to take a process perspective. The ultimate goal of BPI is not to improve information systems or the recording of data; instead the focus should be in improving the process. For example, we may want to aim at reducing costs, minimizing response times, and ensuring compliance. This requires a \u201cconfrontation\u201d between process models and event data. Recent advances in process mining allow us to automatically learn process models showing the bottlenecks from \u201craw\u201d event data. Moreover, given a normative model, we can use conformance checking to quantify and understand deviations. Automatically learned models may also be used for prediction and recommendation. BPI is rapidly developing as a field linking data science to business process management. This article aims to provide an overview thereby paving the way for the other contributions in this special issue.", "authors": [{"name": "wil van der aalst", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81498646207"}, {"name": "j leon zhao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81410591949"}, {"name": "harry jiannan wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81447604849"}], "title": "Editorial: \u201cBusiness Process Intelligence: Connecting Data and Processes\u201d", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "231\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "31\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "231\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "technische universiteit eindhoven", "city": null, "Name": "wil van der aalst"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "city university", "affiliation_string": "city university of hong kong", "city": "london", "Name": "j leon zhao"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of delaware", "city": null, "Name": "harry jiannan wang"}]}, "Article No.: 20": {"references": ["Wil M.

However, based on their own interests, real-world agents often have different goals (i.e., agents\u2019 goals) and thus may behave differently than designed, often resulting in reduced effectiveness or efficiencies of the executed process. Moreover, existing business process research lacks effective methods for discovering agents\u2019 goals in the actual execution of the designed business processes. To address this problem, we propose an agent-oriented goal mining approach to modeling, discovering, and analyzing agents\u2019 goals in executed business processes using historical event logs and domain data. To the best of our knowledge, our research is the first to adopt the agents\u2019 goal perspective to study inconsistencies between the design and execution of business processes.

Computer-mediated communication research shows that communication patterns play an important role in the collaborative efforts of online knowledge-sharing activities. Existing research is mainly focused on either user egocentric positions in communication networks or communication patterns at the community level. Very few studies examine thread-level communication and process patterns and their impacts on the effectiveness of knowledge sharing. In this study, we fill this research gap by proposing an innovative analytical framework for understanding thread-level knowledge sharing in online Q&A; communities based on dialogue act theory, network analysis, and process mining. More specifically, we assign a dialogue act tag for each post in a discussion thread to capture its conversation purpose and then apply graph and process mining algorithms to examine knowledge-sharing processes. Our results, which are based on a real support forum dataset, show that the proposed analytical framework is effective in identifying important communication, conversation, and process patterns that lead to helpful knowledge sharing in online Q&A; communities.", "authors": [{"name": "g alan wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351603052"}, {"name": "harry jiannan wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81447604849"}, {"name": "jiexun li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87259439357"}, {"name": "alan s abrahams", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100439178"}, {"name": "weiguo fan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81381591210"}], "title": "An Analytical Framework for Understanding Knowledge-Sharing Processes in Online Q&A Communities", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "149\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "238\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "virginia tech", "city": null, "Name": "g alan wang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of delaware", "city": null, "Name": "harry jiannan wang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "oregon state university", "city": null, "Name": "jiexun li"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "virginia tech", "city": null, "Name": "alan s abrahams"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "virginia tech", "city": null, "Name": "weiguo fan"}]}, "Article No.: 24": {"references": ["Rakesh Agrawal , Dimitrios Gunopulos , Frank Leymann, Mining Process Models from Workflow Logs, Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology, p.469-483, March 23-27, 1998\n", "Rakesh Agrawal , Ramakrishnan Srikant, Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases, Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, p.487-499, September 12-15, 1994\n", "Marco Alberti , Federico Chesani , Marco Gavanelli , Evelina Lamma , Paola Mello , Paolo Torroni, Verifiable agent interaction in abductive logic programming: The SCIFF framework, ACM Transactions on Computational Logic (TOCL), v.9 n.4, p.1-43, August 2008[doi>10.1145/1380572.1380578]\n", "Proceedings of the 5th international conference on Business process management, September 2007\n", "Elena Bellodi , Fabrizio Riguzzi , Evelina Lamma, Probabilistic declarative process mining, Proceedings of the 4th international conference on Knowledge science, engineering and management, p.292-303, September 01-03, 2010, Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK\n", "Elena Bellodi , Fabrizio Riguzzi , Evelina Lamma, Probabilistic declarative process mining, Proceedings of the 4th international conference on Knowledge science, engineering and management, p.292-303, September 01-03, 2010, Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK\n", "R.

Applied research that employs such techniques to routinely collected health care data enables stakeholders to empirically investigate care as it is delivered by different health providers. However, cross-organizational mining and the comparative analysis of processes present a set of unique challenges in terms of ensuring population and activity comparability, visualizing the mined models, and interpreting the results. Without addressing these issues, health providers will find it difficult to use process mining insights, and the potential benefits of evidence-based process improvement within health will remain unrealized. In this article, we present a brief introduction on the nature of health care processes, a review of process mining in health literature, and a case study conducted to explore and learn how health care data and cross-organizational comparisons with process-mining techniques may be approached. The case study applies process-mining techniques to administrative and clinical data for patients who present with chest pain symptoms at one of four public hospitals in South Australia. We demonstrate an approach that provides detailed insights into clinical (quality of patient health) and fiscal (hospital budget) pressures in the delivery of health care. We conclude by discussing the key lessons learned from our experience in conducting business process analysis and process mining based on the data from four different hospitals.", "authors": [{"name": "andrew partington", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490691763"}, {"name": "moe wynn", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351604307"}, {"name": "suriadi suriadi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81333491500"}, {"name": "chun ouyang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100423782"}, {"name": "jonathan karnon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658680717"}], "title": "Process Mining for Clinical Processes: A Comparative Analysis of Four Australian Hospitals", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "278\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "23\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "342\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "australia", "university": "university of adelaide", "affiliation_string": "university of adelaide school of population health australia", "city": "adelaide", "Name": "andrew partington"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "queensland university of technology", "affiliation_string": "queensland university of technology information systems school australia", "city": "brisbane", "Name": "moe wynn"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "queensland university of technology", "affiliation_string": "queensland university of technology information systems school australia", "city": "brisbane", "Name": "suriadi suriadi"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "queensland university of technology", "affiliation_string": "queensland university of technology information systems school australia", "city": "brisbane", "Name": "chun ouyang"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "university of adelaide", "affiliation_string": "university of adelaide school of population health australia", "city": "adelaide", "Name": "jonathan karnon"}]}, "Article No.: 21": {"references": ["Hidenao Abe , Shusaku Tsumoto, Text Categorization with Considering Temporal Patterns of Term Usages, Proceedings of the 2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, p.800-807, December 13-13, 2010[doi>10.1109/ICDMW.2010.186]\n", "Akiko Aizawa, An information-theoretic perspective of tf\u2014idf measures, Information Processing and Management: an International Journal, v.39 n.1, p.45-65, January 2003[doi>10.1016/S0306-4573(02)00021-3]\n", "Andr\u00e1s A.

Efficacious assignment of reviewers is one of the most critical processes that controls the quality of the entire project selection and also has a serious implication on business profit. Current methods that focus on workflow automation are more efficient than manual assignment; however, they are not effective, as they fail to consider the real insight of core tasks. Other decision models that analyze core tasks are effective but inefficient when handling large amounts of submissions, and they suffer from irrelevant assignment. Furthermore, they largely ignore real deep insight of back-end data such as quality of the reviewers (e.g., quality and citation impact of their produced research) and the effect of social relationships in project selection processes that are essential for identifying reviewers for interdisciplinary proposal evaluation. In light of these deficiencies, this research proposes a novel hybrid process analytics approach to decompose the complex reviewer assignment process into manageable subprocesses and applies data-driven decision models cum process analytics systematically from a triangular perspective via the research analytics framework to achieve high operational efficiencies and high-quality assignment. It also analyzes big data from scientific databases and generates visualized decision-ready information to support effective decision making. The proposed approach has been implemented to aid the project selection process of the largest funding agency in China and has been tested. The test results show that the proposed approach has the potential to add great benefits, including cost saving, improved effectiveness, and increased business value.", "authors": [{"name": "thushari silva", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81558237856"}, {"name": "ma jian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658642119"}, {"name": "yang chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658638661"}], "title": "Process Analytics Approach for R&D Project Selection", "citations": [{"Name": "Wei-Dong Zhu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fang Liu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yu-Wang Chen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jian-Bo Yang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dong-Ling Xu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dong-Peng Wang", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "130\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "22\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "252\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "city university", "affiliation_string": "city university of hong kong hong kong", "city": "london", "Name": "thushari silva"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "city university", "affiliation_string": "city university of hong kong hong kong", "city": "london", "Name": "ma jian"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "city university", "affiliation_string": "city university of hong kong university of science and technology of china hong kong", "city": "london", "Name": "yang chen"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 2": {"references": ["AdverseEvents.

It is reported that about 5&percnt; of hospital admissions are attributed to adverse drug reactions and many deaths are eventually caused, which is a serious concern in public health. Currently, drug safety detection relies heavily on voluntarily reporting system, electronic health records, or relevant databases. There is often a time delay before the reports are filed and only a small portion of adverse drug reactions experienced by health consumers are reported. Given the popularity of social media, many health social media sites are now available for health consumers to discuss any health-related issues, including adverse drug reactions they encounter. There is a large volume of health-consumer-contributed content available, but little effort has been made to harness this information for postmarketing drug safety surveillance to supplement the traditional approach. In this work, we propose the association rule mining approach to identify the association between a drug and an adverse drug reaction. We use the alerts posted by Food and Drug Administration as the gold standard to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. The result shows that the performance of harnessing health-related social media content to detect adverse drug reaction is good and promising.", "authors": [{"name": "christopher c yang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87959282057"}, {"name": "haodong yang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81508693732"}, {"name": "ling jiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87959189557"}], "title": "Postmarketing Drug Safety Surveillance Using Publicly Available Health-Consumer-Contributed Content in Social Media", "citations": [{"Name": "Chih-Hsuan Wei ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Robert Leaman ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zhiyong Lu", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yi Chen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yunzhong Liu", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "111\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "13\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "402\n", "Citation Count": "4\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "drexel university", "city": null, "Name": "christopher c yang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "drexel university", "city": null, "Name": "haodong yang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "drexel university", "city": null, "Name": "ling jiang"}]}, "Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Mark Aberdour, Achieving Quality in Open Source Software, IEEE Software, v.24 n.1, p.58-64, January 2007[doi>10.1109/MS.2007.2]\n", "Faheem Ahmed , Salah Bouktif , Adel Serhani , Issa Khalil, Integrating Function Point Project Information for Improving the Accuracy of Effort Estimation, Proceedings of the 2008 The Second International Conference on Advanced Engineering Computing and Applications in Sciences, p.193-198, September 29-October 04, 2008[doi>10.1109/ADVCOMP.2008.42]\n", "Rami Bahsoon , Wolfgang Emmerich, Evaluating Architectural Stability with Real Options Theory, Proceedings of the 20th IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance, p.443-447, September 11-14, 2004\n", "Bouktif, S., Azar, D., Sahraoui, S., Kegl, B., and Precup, D. 2004.

Organizations are also now adopting OSS, despite some reservations, particularly about the quality issues. Stability of software is one of the main features in software quality management that needs to be understood and accurately predicted. It deals with the impact resulting from software changes and argues that stable components lead to a cost-effective software evolution. Changes are most common phenomena present in OSS in comparison to proprietary software. This makes OSS system evolution a rich context to study and predict stability. Our objective in this work is to build stability prediction models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, that is, able to explain the link between the architectural aspects of a software component and its stability behavior in the context of OSS. Therefore, we propose a new approach based on classifiers combination capable of preserving prediction interpretability. Our approach is classifier-structure dependent. Therefore, we propose a particular solution for combining Bayesian classifiers in order to derive a more accurate composite classifier that preserves interpretability. This solution is implemented using a genetic algorithm and applied in the context of an OSS large-scale system, namely the standard Java API. The empirical results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches from both machine learning and software engineering.", "authors": [{"name": "salah bouktif", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100354530"}, {"name": "houari sahraoui", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100192965"}, {"name": "faheem ahmed", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323487453"}], "title": "Predicting Stability of Open-Source Software Systems Using Combination of Bayesian Classifiers", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "58\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "228\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "uae university uae", "city": null, "Name": "salah bouktif"}, {"country": "Canada", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of montreal canada", "city": "montreal", "Name": "houari sahraoui"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "thompson rivers university", "affiliation_string": "thompson rivers university canada", "city": "kamloops", "Name": "faheem ahmed"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["Allg\u00f6wer, M. and Burri, C. 1967.

Early prediction of patients at risk for septic shock is therefore crucial to minimizing the effects of these complications. Potential indications for septic shock risk span a wide range of measurements, including physiological data gathered at different temporal resolutions and gene expression levels, leading to a nontrivial prediction problem. Previous works on septic shock prediction have used small, carefully curated datasets or clinical measurements that may not be available for many ICU patients. The recent availability of a large, rich ICU dataset called MIMIC-II has provided the opportunity for more extensive modeling of this problem. However, such a large clinical dataset inevitably contains a substantial amount of missing data. We investigate how different imputation selection criteria and methods can overcome the missing data problem. Our results show that imputation methods in conjunction with predictive modeling can lead to accurate septic shock prediction, even if the features are restricted primarily to noninvasive measurements. Our models provide a generalized approach for predicting septic shock in any ICU patient.", "authors": [{"name": "joyce c ho", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87958670857"}, {"name": "cheng h lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87959335157"}, {"name": "joydeep ghosh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84459019157"}], "title": "Septic Shock Prediction for Patients with Missing Data", "citations": [{"Name": "Donald J.

The example of eBay\u2019s failure in China indicates that earning the trust of Chinese consumers is essential to success, yet the process of building that trust requires something different from that in the Western culture. This article attempts to build a theoretical model to explore the relationship between the Confucian culture and online trust. We introduce two new constructs, namely process flexibility and perceived control, as particularly important factors in online trust formation in the Chinese cultural context. A survey was conducted to test the proposed theoretical model. This study offers a new explanation for online trust formation in the Confucian context. The findings of this article can provide guidance for companies hoping to successfully navigate the Chinese online market in the future.", "authors": [{"name": "lihua huang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81315489534"}, {"name": "sulin ba", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100613142"}, {"name": "xianghua lu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81315489697"}], "title": "Building Online Trust in a Culture of Confucianism: The Impact of Process Flexibility and Perceived Control", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "139\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "396\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "china", "university": "fudan university", "affiliation_string": "fudan university", "city": "shanghai", "Name": "lihua huang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of connecticut", "city": null, "Name": "sulin ba"}, {"country": "china", "university": "fudan university", "affiliation_string": "fudan university", "city": "shanghai", "Name": "xianghua lu"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Xue Bai, Rema Padman, and Ramayya Krishnan. 2007.

Managers must choose how to control for such information risk. This article defines the flow risk reduction problem and presents a formal model using a workflow framework. Three different control placement methods are introduced to solve the problem, and a comparative analysis is presented using a robust test set of 162 simulations. One year of simulated attacks is used to validate the quality of the solutions. We find that the math programming control placement method yields substantial improvements in terms of risk reduction and risk reduction on investment when compared to heuristics that would typically be used by managers to solve the problem. The contribution of this research is to provide managers with methods to substantially reduce information and security risks, while obtaining significantly better returns on their security investments. By using a workflow approach to control placement, which guides the manager to examine the entire infrastructure in a holistic manner, this research is unique in that it enables information risk to be examined strategically.", "authors": [{"name": "m lisa yeo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87958837157"}, {"name": "erik rolland", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100061257"}, {"name": "jackie rees ulmer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87959151657"}, {"name": "raymond a patterson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100562282"}], "title": "Risk Mitigation Decisions for IT Security", "citations": [{"Name": "Xiaoyu Yu ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yi Chen ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bang Nguyen ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wenhong Zhang", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ties with government", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "strategic capability", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "258\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "27\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "591\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "loyola university maryland", "city": null, "Name": "m lisa yeo"}, {"country": "Trinidad and Tobago", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california merced", "city": "california", "Name": "erik rolland"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "purdue university", "city": null, "Name": "jackie rees ulmer"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of alberta", "affiliation_string": "university of alberta", "city": "edmonton", "Name": "raymond a patterson"}]}}, "date": {"month": "April", "year": "2014"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 15": {"references": ["G.

A key activity in the requirements engineering (RE) process for such a project is to demonstrate that all relevant requirements have been elicited from the regulatory documents and have been traced to the contract as well as to the target system components. That is, the requirements have met regulatory compliance. However, there are impediments to achieving this level of compliance due to such complexity factors as voluminous contract, large number of regulatory documents, and multiple domains of the system. Little empirical research has been conducted in the scientific community on identifying these impediments. Knowing these impediments is a driver for change in the solutions domain (i.e., creating improved or new methods, tools, processes, etc.) to deal with such impediments. Through a case study of an industrial RE project, we have identified a number of key impediments to achieving regulatory compliance in a large-scale, complex, systems engineering project. This project is an upgrade of a rail infrastructure system. The key contribution of the article is a number of hitherto uncovered impediments described in qualitative and quantitative terms. The article also describes an artefact model, depicting key artefacts and relationships involved in such a compliance project. This model was created from data gathered and observations made in this compliance project. In addition, the article describes emergent metrics on regulatory compliance of requirements that can possibly be used for estimating the effort needed to achieve regulatory compliance of system requirements.", "authors": [{"name": "md rashed i nekvi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502806613"}, {"name": "nazim h madhavji", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100077635"}], "title": "Impediments to Regulatory Compliance of Requirements in Contractual Systems Engineering Projects: A Case Study", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "74\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "97\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "canada", "university": "university of western ontario", "affiliation_string": "university of western ontario london ontario canada", "city": "london", "Name": "md rashed i nekvi"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of western ontario", "affiliation_string": "university of western ontario london ontario canada", "city": "london", "Name": "nazim h madhavji"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Alain Abran , Pierre Bourque , Robert Dupuis , James W.

To support a more insightful management of IT projects, which may also facilitate an early detection of IT project failures, transparency regarding a project's cash flows shall be increased. Therefore, an appropriate analysis of a project's benefits, costs, requirements, their respective risks and interdependencies is inevitable. However, to date, in requirements engineering only few methods exist that appropriately consider these factors when estimating the ex ante project business case. Furthermore, empirical studies reveal that a lot of risk factors emerge during the runtime of projects why the ex ante valuation of IT projects even with respect to requirements seems insufficient.

Factors such as air travel act as a catalyst in the spread of new and existing viruses. The unprecedented user-generated activity on social networks over the last few years has created real-time streams of personal data that provide an invaluable tool for monitoring and sampling large populations. Epidemic intelligence relies on constant monitoring of online media sources for early warning, detection, and rapid response; however, the real-time information available in social networks provides a new paradigm for the early warning function.The communication of risk in any public health emergency is a complex task for governments and healthcare agencies. This task is made more challenging in the current situation when the public has access to a wide range of online resources, ranging from traditional news channels to information posted on blogs and social networks. Twitter\u2019s strength is its two-way communication nature --- both as an information source but also as a central hub for publishing, disseminating and discovering online media.This study addresses these two challenges by investigating the role of Twitter during the 2009 swine flu pandemic by analysing data collected from the SN, and by Twitter using the opposite way for dissemination information through the network. First, we demonstrate the role of the social network for early warning by detecting an upcoming spike in an epidemic before the official surveillance systems by up to two weeks in the U.K. and up to two to three weeks in the U.S. Second, we illustrate how online resources are propagated through Twitter at the time of the WHO\u2019s declaration of the swine flu \u201cpandemic\u201d. Our findings indicate that Twitter does favour reputable t bogus information can still leak into the network.", "authors": [{"name": "patty kostkova", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100628567"}, {"name": "martin szomszor", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351595302"}, {"name": "connie st louis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490656051"}], "title": "#swineflu: The Use of Twitter as an Early Warning and Risk Communication Tool in the 2009 Swine Flu Pandemic", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "343\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "40\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "641\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university college london", "city": null, "Name": "patty kostkova"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "martin szomszor"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "connie st louis"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Ross Anderson and Tyler Moore. 2009.

The environment combines a high resolution individual-based model with a user-friendly Web-based interface that allows analysts to access the models and the analytics backend remotely from a desktop or a mobile device. The environment is based on a loosely coupled service-oriented-architecture that allows analysts to explore various counterfactual scenarios. As the modeling tools for public health epidemiology are getting more sophisticated, it is becoming increasingly difficult for noncomputational scientists to effectively use the systems that incorporate such models. Thus an important design consideration for an integrated modeling environment is to improve ease of use such that experimental simulations can be driven by the users. This is achieved by designing intuitive and user-friendly interfaces that allow users to design and analyze a computational experiment and steer the experiment based on the state of the system.A key feature of a system that supports this design goal is the ability to start, stop, pause, and roll back the disease propagation and intervention application process interactively. An analyst can access the state of the system at any point in time and formulate dynamic interventions based on additional information obtained through state assessment. In addition, the environment provides automated services for experiment set-up and management, thus reducing the overall time for conducting end-to-end experimental studies.We illustrate the applicability of the system by describing computational experiments based on realistic pandemic planning scenarios. The experiments are designed to demonstrate the system\u2019s capability and enhanced user productivity.", "authors": [{"name": "suruchi deodhar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490645281"}, {"name": "keith r bisset", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100523933"}, {"name": "jiangzhuo chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100119086"}, {"name": "yifei ma", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490674879"}, {"name": "madhav v marathe", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100088054"}], "title": "An Interactive, Web-Based High Performance Modeling Environment for Computational Epidemiology", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "67\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "164\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Honduras", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ndssl virginia bioinformatics institute virginia tech", "city": "virginia", "Name": "suruchi deodhar"}, {"country": "Honduras", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ndssl virginia bioinformatics institute virginia tech", "city": "virginia", "Name": "keith r bisset"}, {"country": "Honduras", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ndssl virginia bioinformatics institute virginia tech", "city": "virginia", "Name": "jiangzhuo chen"}, {"country": "Honduras", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ndssl virginia bioinformatics institute virginia tech", "city": "virginia", "Name": "yifei ma"}, {"country": "Honduras", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ndssl virginia bioinformatics institute virginia tech", "city": "virginia", "Name": "madhav v marathe"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["Yiannis Andreopoulos, Comments on \"Phase-shifting for nonseparable 2-D Haar wavelets\", IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, v.18 n.8, p.1897-1898, August 2009[doi>10.1109/TIP.2009.2021085]\n", "Ricardo de A.

One major stock analysis method is the use of candlestick charts. However, candlestick chart analysis has usually been based on the utilization of numerical formulas. There has been no work taking advantage of an image processing technique to directly analyze the visual content of the candlestick charts for stock prediction. Therefore, in this study we apply the concept of image retrieval to extract seven different wavelet-based texture features from candlestick charts. Then, similar historical candlestick charts are retrieved based on different texture features related to the query chart, and the \u201cfuture\u201d stock movements of the retrieved charts are used for stock prediction. To assess the applicability of this approach to stock prediction, two datasets are used, containing 5-year and 10-year training and testing sets, collected from the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (INDU) for the period between 1990 and 2009. Moreover, two datasets (2010 and 2011) are used to further validate the proposed approach. The experimental results show that visual content extraction and similarity matching of candlestick charts is a new and useful analytical method for stock prediction. More specifically, we found that the extracted feature vectors of 30, 90, and 120, the number of textual features extracted from the candlestick charts in the BMP format, are more suitable for predicting stock movements, while the 90 feature vector offers the best performance for predicting short- and medium-term stock movements. That is, using the 90 feature vector provides the lowest MAPE (3.031&percnt;) and Theil\u2019s U (1.988&percnt;) rates in the twenty-year dataset, and the best MAPE (2.625&percnt;, 2.945&percnt;) and Theil\u2019s U (1.622&percnt;, 1.972&percnt;) rates in the two validation datasets (2010 and 2011).", "authors": [{"name": "chih-fong tsai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330499242"}, {"name": "zen-yu quan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81503684492"}], "title": "Stock Prediction by Searching for Similarities in Candlestick Charts", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "203\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "33\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "364\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "chih-fong tsai"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "zen-yu quan"}]}}, "date": {"month": "July", "year": "2014"}}}, "Volume7": {"Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 4": {"references": ["S.

The log analysis technique is useful for discovering possible problems in business processes and preventing illegal-intrusion attempts and data-tampering attacks. Because of the complexity of the dynamically changing environment, auditing a tremendous number of data is a challenging issue. We provide a real-time audit mechanism to improve the aforementioned problems in log auditing. This mechanism was developed based on the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression technique to facilitate effective compression and provide reliable auditing log entries. The mechanism can be used to predict unusual activities when compressing the log data according to pre-defined auditing rules. Auditors using real-time and continuous monitoring can perceive instantly the most likely anomalies or exceptions that could cause problems. We also designed a user interface that allows auditors to define the various compression and audit parameters, using real log cases in the experiment to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of this proposed audit mechanism. In summary, this mechanism changes the log access method and improves the efficiency of log analysis. This mechanism greatly simplifies auditing so that auditors must only trace the sources and causes of the problems related to the detected anomalies. This greatly reduces the processing time of analytical audit procedures and the manual checking time, and improves the log audit efficiency.", "authors": [{"name": "shing-han li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658699120"}, {"name": "david c yen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=86159236957"}, {"name": "ying-ping chuang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658706695"}], "title": "A Real-Time Audit Mechanism Based on the Compression Technique", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "45\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "45\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "45\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "taiwan", "university": "national taipei university", "affiliation_string": "national taipei university of business taipei city taiwan", "city": "taibei", "Name": "shing-han li"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "suny college at oneonta oneonta ny", "city": null, "Name": "david c yen"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "tatung university ", "affiliation_string": "tatung university 3rd section taipei taiwan", "city": "taibei", "Name": "ying-ping chuang"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2016"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["2006.

The interleaving nature of data management and BP execution and the lack of a coherent conceptual data model foralldata needed for execution make it hard for (1) providing Business-Process-as-a-Service (BPaaS) and (2) effective support for collaboration between business processes. The primary reason is that an enormous effort is required for maintaining both the engines and the data for the client applications. In particular, different modeling languages and different BPM systems make process interoperation one of the toughest challenges. In this article, we formulate a concept of a \u201cuniversal artifact,\u201d which extends artifact-centric models by capturingall needed datafor a process instance throughout its execution. A framework called SeGA based on universal artifacts is developed to support separation of data and BP execution, a key principle for BPM systems. We demonstrate in this article that SeGA is versatile enough to fully facilitate not only executions of individual processes (to support BPaaS) but also various collaboration models. Moreover, SeGA reduces the complexity in runtime management including runtime querying, constraints enforcement, and dynamic modification upon collaboration across possibly different BPM systems.", "authors": [{"name": "yutian sun", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81500647739"}, {"name": "jianwen su", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100109228"}, {"name": "jian yang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452595001"}], "title": "Universal Artifacts: A New Approach to Business Process Management (BPM) Systems", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "56\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "56\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "56\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Honduras", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california santa barbara ca", "city": "santa barbara", "Name": "yutian sun"}, {"country": "Honduras", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california santa barbara ca", "city": "santa barbara", "Name": "jianwen su"}, {"country": "spain", "university": "ie university", "affiliation_string": "macquarie university australia", "city": "segovia", "Name": "jian yang"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Sinan Aral , Peter Weill, IT Assets, Organizational Capabilities, and Firm Performance: How Resource Allocations and Organizational Differences Explain Performance Variation, Organization Science, v.18 n.5, p.763-780, September 2007[doi>10.1287/orsc.1070.0306]\n", "Marjan Aslanzadeh and Byron William Keating. 2014.

At the same time, the continuous evolution and performance improvements in information technology (IT) capabilities have enabled the utilization of multichannel service delivery strategies. Our research focuses on IT-enabled customer service systems (CSS) and their effect on firm performance. Previous studies have failed to find a consensus on the effect of a new self-service channel on the firm's performance. We argue that the embedded assumptions underpinning the previous research are responsible for these mixed findings. Consequently, using archival data from 169 hotels affiliated with a hotel chain, we designed a longitudinal multichannel study to resolve some of these inconsistencies. Our results illustrate that when firms implement an IT-enabled self-service channel to complement their existing customer service infrastructure, they experience an early negative effect on financial performance due to the disruption of the service processes. Thus, the multichannel CSS generates a positive effect only when the new process becomes a stable part of the organizational procedures. Our findings suggest that researchers evaluate the effect of a technological initiative after the new business process has been stabilized and consider that an additional IT-enabled self-service channel rarely operates in isolation.", "authors": [{"name": "tsz-wai lui", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100460312"}, {"name": "gabriele piccoli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100125713"}], "title": "The Effect of a Multichannel Customer Service System on Customer Service and Financial Performance", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "55\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "36\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "55\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "taiwan", "university": "ming chuan university", "affiliation_string": "ming chuan university taoyuan county taiwan", "city": "taibei", "Name": "tsz-wai lui"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "louisiana state university la usa", "city": null, "Name": "gabriele piccoli"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["J.

But discovering how to target the most valuable web visitors and generate a high response rate is still a challenge for advertising intermediaries and advertisers. The purpose of this study is to examine how behavioral targeting (BT) impacts users\u2019 responses to online ads and particularly whether BT works better in combination with contextual targeting (CT). Using a large, individual-level clickstream data set of an automobile advertising campaign from an Internet advertising intermediary, this study examines the impact of BT and CT strategies on users\u2019 click behavior. The results show that (1) targeting a user with behavioral characteristics that are closely related to ads does not necessarily increase the click through rates (CTRs); whereas, targeting a user with behavioral characteristics that are loosely related to ads leads to a higher CTR, and (2) BT and CT work better in combination. Our study contributes to online advertising design literature and provides important managerial implications for advertising intermediaries and advertisers on targeting individual users.", "authors": [{"name": "xianghua lu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81315489697"}, {"name": "xia zhao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81549510556"}, {"name": "ling xue", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658969951"}], "title": "Is Combining Contextual and Behavioral Targeting Strategies Effective in Online Advertising?", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "96\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "70\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "96\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "china", "university": "fudan university", "affiliation_string": "fudan university shanghai china", "city": "shanghai", "Name": "xianghua lu"}, {"country": "Hong Kong", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of north carolina at greensboro greensboro nc", "city": "north", "Name": "xia zhao"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "georgia state university atlanta ga", "city": "atlanta", "Name": "ling xue"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2016"}}}, "Volume2": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Article No.: 22": {"references": ["Ahmed Abbasi , Hsinchun Chen, CyberGate: a design framework and system for text analysis of computer-mediated communication, MIS Quarterly, v.32 n.4, p.811-837, December 2008\n", "Sitaram Asur , Bernardo A.

Among many different types of social media, social broadcasting networks such as Twitter in the U.S. and \u201cWeibo\u201d in China are particularly interesting from a business perspective. In the case of Twitter, the huge amounts of real-time data with extremely rich text, along with valuable structural information, makes Twitter a great platform to build Business Intelligence (BI) systems. We propose a framework of social-broadcasting-based BI systems that utilizes real-time information extracted from these data with text mining techniques. To demonstrate this framework, we designed and implemented a Twitter-based BI system that forecasts movie box office revenues during the opening weekend and forecasts daily revenue after 4 weeks. We found that incorporating information from Twitter could reduce the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) by 44&percnt; for the opening weekend and by 36&percnt; for total revenue. For daily revenue forecasting, including Twitter information into a baseline model could reduce forecasting errors by 17.5&percnt; on average. On the basis of these results, we conclude that social-broadcasting-based BI systems have great potential and should be explored by both researchers and practitioners.", "authors": [{"name": "huaxia rui", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81317499147"}, {"name": "andrew whinston", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100445877"}], "title": "Designing a social-broadcasting-based business intelligence system", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "103\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "18\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "984\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of texas at austin austin tx", "city": "austin", "Name": "huaxia rui"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of texas at austin austin tx", "city": "austin", "Name": "andrew whinston"}]}, "Article No.: 25": {"references": ["Ahmed Abbasi , Zhu Zhang , David Zimbra , Hsinchun Chen , Jay F.

Manual approaches to detecting and analyzing fake reviews (i.e., spam) are not practical due to the problem of information overload. However, the design and development of automated methods of detecting fake reviews is a challenging research problem. The main reason is that fake reviews are specifically composed to mislead readers, so they may appear the same as legitimate reviews (i.e., ham). As a result, discriminatory features that would enable individual reviews to be classified as spam or ham may not be available. Guided by the design science research methodology, the main contribution of this study is the design and instantiation of novel computational models for detecting fake reviews. In particular, a novel text mining model is developed and integrated into a semantic language model for the detection of untruthful reviews. The models are then evaluated based on a real-world dataset collected from amazon.com. The results of our experiments confirm that the proposed models outperform other well-known baseline models in detecting fake reviews. To the best of our knowledge, the work discussed in this article represents the first successful attempt to apply text mining methods and semantic language models to the detection of fake consumer reviews. A managerial implication of our research is that firms can apply our design artifacts to monitor online consumer reviews to develop effective marketing or product design strategies based on genuine consumer feedback posted to the Internet.", "authors": [{"name": "raymond y k lau", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81406595957"}, {"name": "s y liao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452604293"}, {"name": "ron chi-wai kwok", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100525073"}, {"name": "kaiquan xu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81479645252"}, {"name": "yunqing xia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442601568"}, {"name": "yuefeng li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409597966"}], "title": "Text mining and probabilistic language modeling for online review spam detection", "citations": [{"Name": "David Savage ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiuzhen Zhang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xinghuo Yu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Pauline Chou ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Qingmai Wang", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Detection of opinion spam based on anomalous rating deviation", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Donato Hern\u00e1ndez Fusilier ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Manuel Montes-y-G\u00f3mez ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Paolo Rosso ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rafael Guzm\u00e1n Cabrera", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Detecting positive and negative deceptive opinions using PU-learning", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Douglas C.

Despite a five-decade tradition of such IS, many executives still complain that they bear little relevance to managing a company and, even more, fail to accommodate their working style. The increasing acceptance of IS among today's executives and technological advances of the Internet era make the present moment favorable for redesigning EIS. Following the design science paradigm in IS research, this article provides six principles for such a redesign. To do so, we survey executives regarding their requirements and the IS they currently use. We then derive principles for a redesign to fill the gaps. They address diverse areas: a comprehensive information model, functions to better analyze and process information, easy-to-use IS handling, a more flexible IS architecture and data model, a proper information management, and fast prototype implementation. Finally a field test demonstrates and evaluates the utility of our proposal by means of a prototype.", "authors": [{"name": "frederik marx", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81482651906"}, {"name": "jorg h mayer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81487646141"}, {"name": "robert winter", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100585971"}], "title": "Six principles for redesigning executive information systems\u2014findings of a survey and evaluation of a prototype", "citations": [{"Name": "J\u00f6rg Hans Mayer ", "Country": "finland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Robert Winter", "Country": "finland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bih-Ru Lea ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fiona Fui-Hoon Nah", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Usability of performance dashboards", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "usefulness of operational and tactical support", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "and quality of strategic support: a research framework", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "John Leslie King ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Carl P.

With increasing traffic on e-commerce Web sites, providing such live-chat services requires a good allocation of service resources to serve the customers. When resources are limited, firms may consider employing priority-processing and reserving resources for high-value customers. In this article, we model a reserve-based priority-processing policy for e-commerce systems that have imperfect customer classification. Two policy decisions considered in the model are: (1) the number of agents exclusively reserved for high-value customers, and (2) the configuration of the classification system. We derive explicit expressions for average waiting times of high-value and low-value customer classes and define a total waiting cost function. Through numerical analysis, we study the impact of these two policy decisions on average waiting times and total waiting costs. Our analysis finds that reserving agents for high-value customers may have negative consequences for such customers under imperfect classification. Further, we study the interaction between the two policy decisions and discuss how one decision should be modified with respect to a change in the other one in order to keep the waiting costs minimized.", "authors": [{"name": "paulo goes", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100263166"}, {"name": "noyan ilk", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81486645088"}, {"name": "wei t yue", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100421176"}, {"name": "j leon zhao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81410591949"}], "title": "Live-chat agent assignments to heterogeneous e-customers under imperfect classification", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "48\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "341\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of arizona tucson az", "city": "arizona", "Name": "paulo goes"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of arizona tucson az", "city": "arizona", "Name": "noyan ilk"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "city university", "affiliation_string": "city university of hong kong hong kong china", "city": "london", "Name": "wei t yue"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "city university", "affiliation_string": "city university of hong kong hong kong china", "city": "london", "Name": "j leon zhao"}]}, "Article No.: 21": {"references": ["Ahn, J., Han, S., and Lee, Y. 2006.

Yet, effective use of that information to inform and drive business operations is a challenge. Our industry-university collaborative project draws from a rich dataset of commercial demographics, transaction history, product features, and Service Quality Index (SQI) factors on shipping transactions at FedEx. We apply inductive methods to understand and predict customer churn in a noncontractual setting. Results identify several SQI variables as important determinants of churn across a variety of analytic approaches. Building on this we propose the design of a Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard as an innovative approach for increasing customer retention by identifying potential churners based on combinations of predictor variables such as demographics and SQI factors. This empirical study contributes to BI research and practice by demonstrating the application of data analytics to the fundamental business operations problem of customer churn.", "authors": [{"name": "balaji padmanabhan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100143010"}, {"name": "alan hevner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100647777"}, {"name": "michael cuenco", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81493659746"}, {"name": "crystal shi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81493643767"}], "title": "From information to operations: Service quality and customer retention", "citations": [{"Name": "Jiming Wu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Clyde W.

This study applies the speech act theory to analyze the data collected in a study by Trauth and Jessup [2000] and confirms previous research findings that both the topic and the group size influence the pattern of discussion, especially when issues are threatening. It also shows that the abundance of speech acts like assertives, directives, and expressives can be accounted for by a few simple recurring patterns, indicating participants are rather close-minded. More important, linguistic analysis helps uncovering defensive speech routines that inhibit the generation of valid information and create self-sealing patterns of escalating error. Linguistic analysis may therefore complement positivist and interpretive analysis by examining if participants' engagement is superficial or profound, if consensus is reached or blocked, and if certain speech acts lead to dysfunctional organizational learning. Hence, in the era of participatory Web in which language is the primary medium for interactive sharing and dynamic collaboration, linguistic analysis can be applied to study the promises and declarations that people rely on to initiate, coordinate, and complete social actions.", "authors": [{"name": "feng-yang kuo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100454951"}, {"name": "chun-po yin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81482641266"}], "title": "A linguistic analysis of group support systems interactions for uncovering social realities of organizations", "citations": [{"Name": "Douglas C.

Previous research in information visualization has shown that visualization techniques can help users comprehend information and accomplish information tasks more efficiently and effectively. However, only a limited number of such techniques have been applied to Web search result visualization with mixed evaluation results. Using a design science approach, this research designed and implemented a glyph (a graphical object that represents the values of multiple dimensions using multiple visual parameters) and a system for visualizing Web search results. A flower metaphor was adopted in the glyph design to represent the characteristics and metadata of Web documents. Following the cognitive fit theory, an experimental study was conducted to evaluate three displays: a numeric display, a glyph display, and a combined display which showed numbers only, glyphs only, and both, respectively. Experimental results showed that the glyph display and the combined display performed better when task complexity was high, and the numeric display and the combined display performed better when task complexity was low. The combined display also received the best perceived usability from the subjects. Based on the findings, the implications of the study to research and practice are discussed and some future research directions are suggested.", "authors": [{"name": "michael chau", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100524697"}], "title": "Visualizing web search results using glyphs: Design and evaluation of a flower metaphor", "citations": [{"Name": "Caio D'Agostini ", "Country": "brazil", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ricardo Cava ", "Country": "brazil", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Carina F.

Q Method is used to uncover five archetypes of public sector CIOs which are shown to be reliable across two Q sorts. These archetypes include politically-oriented CIO, savvy negotiator, technology optimizer, and skillful communicator. Further analysis using a tournament scoring approach indicates that business-oriented CIOs are the most effective. Applying a stakeholder perspective to interpret the results, it is proposed that business-oriented CIOs understand the value in tracking closely to an organization's business leaders and strategically ignoring other stakeholders in their environment, even politically powerful ones. The development and comparison of archetypes provide a new focus of CIO research by extending from the individual level of the attribute to a combination of attributes (archetypes).", "authors": [{"name": "gregory s dawson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81482640929"}, {"name": "richard t watson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452614454"}], "title": "Uncovering and testing archetypes of effective public sector CIOs", "citations": [{"Name": "Fred Niederman ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Thomas W.

Prior studies on computer use usually treat technologies as a \u201cblack box\u201d and rarely look into how computers are used in workplaces and why IT-related skills are important there. In this study, we use the data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the data on job requirements for over 12,000 occupations from the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT), to examine the complementary roles of skill sets and nonroutine tasks in providing computer-use wage returns for individual workers. We find that computer use is associated with increased levels of interactive and numerical skills required for the general workforce. In addition, workers who use computers at work and possess higher levels of interactive skills receive higher wages. We also find that computer use complements performing nonroutine tasks, particularly nonroutine abstract tasks in contributing to the wage premium. As the tasks become increasingly routine, the impact of computer use on wage returns diminishes.", "authors": [{"name": "debabrata dey", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100327360"}, {"name": "ming fan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81423593835"}, {"name": "gang peng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100050252"}], "title": "Computer use and wage returns: The complementary roles of IT-related human capital and nonroutine tasks", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "31\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "342\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of washington seattle wa", "city": "washington", "Name": "debabrata dey"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of washington seattle wa", "city": "washington", "Name": "ming fan"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "youngstown state university youngstown oh", "city": null, "Name": "gang peng"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Maryam Alavi , Dorothy E.

Phase 1 involves an in-depth case study of the collaborative processes surrounding the development of the Wikipedia article on the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre. The rich data collected are used to develop an initial set of testable hypotheses of factors that enhance the quality of peer-produced information in wiki environments. Phase 2 tests these theories through a quantitative analysis of the collaborative features associated with 188 similar articles that Wikipedia considered for recognition as their best (i.e., the top 0.1&percnt;). Four collaborative features are examined for their effects on quality: volume of contributor activity, type of contributor activity, number of anonymous contributors, and top contributor experience. Volume of contributor activity is the only feature that is unsupported, a particularly interesting result because previous literature connects that factor most clearly to success in wiki-based collaboration. Implications are discussed.", "authors": [{"name": "gerald c kane", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323491657"}], "title": "A multimethod study of information quality in wiki collaboration", "citations": [{"Name": "Andrew J.

Most of prior research separately analyzes the meanings of the qualitative or quantitative features, and does not consider the categorical information when clustering financial reports. Since quantitative or qualitative features contain only partial information, there may be no synergy by considering them individually. It is more appropriate to predict stock price movements by simultaneously taking both quantitative and qualitative features into account. Therefore, in this study, we utilize a weighting scheme to combine both qualitative and quantitative features of financial reports together, and propose a method to predict short-term stock price movements. The proposed method employs the categorical information to localize the clusters and improve the purity of each resultant cluster. We gathered 26,255 reports of companies listed in the S&P; 500 index from the EDGAR database and conducted the GICS (Global Industrial Classification System) experiments based on the industry sectors. The empirical evaluation results show that the proposed method outperforms the SVM, na\u00efve Bayes, and PFHC methods in terms of accuracy and average profit.", "authors": [{"name": "ming-chih lin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453605916"}, {"name": "anthony j t lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100385362"}, {"name": "rung-tai kao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490663844"}, {"name": "kuo-tay chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81421599775"}], "title": "Stock price movement prediction using representative prototypes of financial reports", "citations": [{"Name": "Mijung Kim ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "K.

In this article, we propose a subject-centered model of collaborative tagging to account for the ternary cooccurrences involving users, items, and tags in such systems. Extending the well-established probabilistic latent semantic analysis theory for knowledge representation, our model maps the user, item, and tag entities into a common latent subject space that captures the \u201cwisdom of the crowd\u201d resulted from the collaborative tagging process. To put this model into action, we have developed a novel way to estimate the probabilistic subject-centered model approximately in a highly efficient manner taking advantage of a matrix factorization method. Our empirical evaluation shows that our proposed approach delivers substantial performance improvement on the knowledge resource recommendation task over the state-of-the-art standard and tag-aware resource recommendation algorithms.", "authors": [{"name": "jing peng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453612599"}, {"name": "daniel d zeng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81311485908"}, {"name": "zan huang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351599463"}], "title": "Latent subject-centered modeling of collaborative tagging: An application in social search", "citations": [{"Name": "Zhu Zhang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daniel D.

Although such communities are easy to create with the availability of numerous tools, the challenge lies in keeping the community alive and thriving. Key to sustainability is members' Sense Of Virtual Community (SOVC) so that they feel responsible for contributing their knowledge and creating value for others. However, it is unclear what leads to the SOVC among knowledge contributors. Building on appraisal theory, we hypothesize that the fulfillment of contributors' informational, instrumental, entertainment, self-discovery, and social enhancement needs will increase their SOVC. To test the hypotheses, we surveyed knowledge contributors in a beauty-product-related community to examine the relationship between their needs' fulfillment and SOVC levels. Other than the social enhancement need, all other needs' fulfillment were found to be positively related to SOVC levels. To further understand how the SOVC of knowledge contributors changes over time, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of a panel of these members. We discovered that over time, changes in the perceived fulfillment of their instrumental, entertainment, and self-discovery needs determined the change of their SOVC. The results have implications for future research as well as for the sustainability and value generation from such virtual communities.", "authors": [{"name": "juliana sutanto", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100245424"}, {"name": "atreyi kankanhalli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100562156"}, {"name": "bernard cheng yian tan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100255785"}], "title": "Eliciting a sense of virtual community among knowledge contributors", "citations": [{"Name": "G.

If the number of candidate features is too large, then traditional feature extraction techniques fail.In order to address the first two challenges, this article proposes a multipartition, multichunk ensemble classifier in which a collection ofvclassifiers is trained fromrconsecutive data chunks usingv-fold partitioning of the data, yielding an ensemble of such classifiers. This multipartition, multichunk ensemble technique significantly reduces classification error compared to existing single-partition, single-chunk ensemble approaches, wherein a single data chunk is used to train each classifier. To address the third challenge, a feature extraction and selection technique is proposed for data streams that do not have any fixed feature set. The technique's scalability is demonstrated through an implementation for the Hadoop MapReduce cloud computing architecture. Both theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrate its effectiveness over other state-of-the-art stream classification techniques on synthetic data, real botnet traffic, and malicious executables.", "authors": [{"name": "mohammad m masud", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350592477"}, {"name": "tahseen m al-khateeb", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435607760"}, {"name": "kevin w hamlen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309487013"}, {"name": "jing gao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314494134"}, {"name": "latifur khan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100344538"}, {"name": "jiawei han", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351593425"}, {"name": "bhavani thuraisingham", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100621824"}], "title": "Cloud-based malware detection for evolving data streams", "citations": [{"Name": "Shahid Alam ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ibrahim Sogukpinar ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Issa Traore ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yvonne Coady", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shing-Han Li ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yu-Cheng Kao ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zong-Cyuan Zhang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ying-Ping Chuang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "David C.

The socio-technical system design intends to implement and support a collaborative travel counseling concept which equalizes travel agents and customers within a value co-created service encounter to resolve the specific problems in travel agency call-centers. The design is finally guided by four instrumental goals: (1) increase transparency, (2) improve information quality, (3) support joint problem solving, and (4) create advisory experience. While the first build-and-evaluate loop mainly enhanced the workplace picture, the second build-and-evaluate loop primarily revealed organizational demands. This indicates that the proposed design approach enables sequentially broadening the problem space for design and supports iteratively moving forward the utility of the emerging artifact. Design is informed by concatenating insights from the previous loops which enrich understanding of the instrumental goals. The presented goals as well as the design approach are encouraging candidates for additional testing as a base for general design principles.", "authors": [{"name": "susanne schmidt-rauch", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81467671088"}, {"name": "gerhard schwabe", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100468229"}], "title": "From telesales to tele-advisory in travel agencies: Business problems, generic design goals and requirements", "citations": [{"Name": "John Leslie King ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Carl P.

At the individual level, we attempted to identify some of the most productive, high-impact researchers, as well as those who exhibited impressive paces of productivity. At the institution level, we revealed some institutions with relatively more productive researchers, as well as institutions that had produced more productive researchers. We also analyzed the overall IS community by examining the primary research areas of productive scholars identified by our analyses.

Most IS research employs trust as a measure of interpersonal or person-to-firm relations, such as trust in a Web vendor or a virtual team member. Although trust in other people is important, this article suggests that trust in the Information Technology (IT) itself also plays a role in shaping IT-related beliefs and behavior. To advance trust and technology research, this article presents a set of trust in technology construct definitions and measures. We also empirically examine these construct measures using tests of convergent, discriminant, and nomological validity. This study contributes to the literature by providing: (a) a framework that differentiates trust in technology from trust in people, (b) a theory-based set of definitions necessary for investigating different kinds of trust in technology, and (c) validated trust in technology measures useful to research and practice.", "authors": [{"name": "d harrison mcknight", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81482651667"}, {"name": "michelle carter", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81486642623"}, {"name": "jason bennett thatcher", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100523117"}, {"name": "paul f clay", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81540352956"}], "title": "Trust in a specific technology: An investigation of its components and measures", "citations": [{"Name": "Zinaida Benenson ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Anna Girard ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ioannis Krontiris ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Vassia Liagkou ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kai Rannenberg ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yannis Stamatiou", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Christina R\u00f6del ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Susanne Stadler ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alexander Meschtscherjakov ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Manfred Tscheligi", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Patricia M.

On the other hand, the public has never stopped criticizing the quality of Wikipedia articles, and critics never have trouble finding low-quality Wikipedia articles. Why do Wikipedia articles vary widely in quality&quest; We investigate the relationship between collaboration and Wikipedia article quality. We show that the quality of Wikipedia articles is not only dependent on the different types of contributors but also on how they collaborate. Based on an empirical study, we classify contributors based on their roles in editing individual Wikipedia articles. We identify various patterns of collaboration based on the provenance or, more specifically, who does what to Wikipedia articles. Our research helps identify collaboration patterns that are preferable or detrimental for article quality, thus providing insights for designing tools and mechanisms to improve the quality of Wikipedia articles.", "authors": [{"name": "jun liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81547338156"}, {"name": "sudha ram", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100149968"}], "title": "Who does what: Collaboration patterns in the wikipedia and their impact on article quality", "citations": [{"Name": "Lionel Robert ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daniel M.

By constructing ARMA models, we show that news and consumer sentiment, when combined with other macroeconomic variables, achieve statistically significant results to explain changes in private consumption. We make three distinct findings with respect to sentiment in consumption behavior models: first, both consumer and news sentiment add explanatory power and statistical significance to conventional consumer behavior models. Second, consumer sentiment, measured by the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment, adds more explanatory power and statistical significance than news sentiment when tested individually. Third, news sentiment is able to determine the signs of all coefficients in the model correctly, whereas consumer sentiment does not. In general, we conclude that news sentiment is a useful variable to add in consumer behavior models, especially when coupled with consumer sentiment and other macroeconomic variables. Tested individually, news sentiment is as good a proxy as personal income for explaining private consumption growth when tested individually.", "authors": [{"name": "matthias w uhl", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81486654492"}], "title": "Explaining U.S. consumer behavior with news sentiment", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "45\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "335\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Switzerland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "kof swiss economic institute eth zurich zurich switzerland", "city": "zurich", "Name": "matthias w uhl"}]}}, "date": {"month": "June", "year": "2011"}}}, "Volume1": {"Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Aggarwal, C.

Research data often needs to be published along with the data mining model for verification or reanalysis. However, the privacy of the published data needs to be protected because otherwise the published data is subject to misuse such as linking attacks. Therefore, employing various privacy protection methods becomes necessary. However, these methods only consider privacy protection and do not guarantee that the same mining models can be built from sanitized data. Thus the published models cannot be verified using the sanitized data. This article proposes a technique that not only protects privacy, but also guarantees that the same model, in the form of decision trees or regression trees, can be built from the sanitized data. We have also experimentally shown that other mining techniques can be used to reanalyze the sanitized data. This technique can be used to promote sharing of research data.", "authors": [{"name": "yu fu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81430664416"}, {"name": "zhiyuan chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81361600610"}, {"name": "gunes koru", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81470653563"}, {"name": "aryya gangopadhyay", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100125231"}], "title": "A privacy protection technique for publishing data mining models and research data", "citations": [{"Name": "Alessandra Sala ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiaohan Zhao ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Christo Wilson ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Haitao Zheng ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ben Y.

This study investigates the search behavior that drives the search for information security knowledge via a search engine. Based on theories in information search and information security behavior we examine the effects of network attacks and vulnerability disclosures on search for information security knowledge by ordinary users. We construct a unique dataset from publicly available sources, and use a dynamic regression model to test the hypotheses empirically. We find that network attacks of current day and one day prior significantly impact the search, while vulnerability disclosure does not significantly affect the search.

Another impediment to the study of wiki sustainability is the absence of time-series analysis methods that are suitable for the unique patterns of wiki activity logs. The primary goals of this study are to: (i) develop a novel method for analyzing wiki edit activity logs, (ii) reveal the temporal patterns of corporate wiki edit activity, and (iii) study the factors impacting wikis' sustainability. A validation of our proposed method demonstrates that it is superior to the baseline algorithm in the face of noisy data. Our empirical study combines wiki system edit activity logs with a survey of users' perceptions, and explores 33277 distinct wiki applications within one global organization over the first 5 years of wiki operation. Our results reveal six different prototypical wiki activity patterns, and show that most corporate wikis become inactive after a relatively short period. Findings from the user survey show that users of sustainable wikis are more satisfied with the wiki system and its contents, and feel that the wiki provides them with a sense of community and productivity enhancements.", "authors": [{"name": "ofer arazy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81440606188"}, {"name": "arie croitoru", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81300092001"}], "title": "The sustainability of corporate wikis: A time-series analysis of activity patterns", "citations": [{"Name": "M.

Virtual goods share similar economic properties (such as substantial production cost and negligible marginal cost) with other types of digital goods. However, one aspect that distinguishes a virtual good is that consumers in a virtual world may want to use multiple copies of the identical goodat the same time, and such simultaneous use of multiple copies of the identical goodincreases a consumer's utility. In this research, we focus on the COPY permission of virtual goods. We develop an economic model to examine under what conditions the COPY permission setting leads to the highest profit for the creator of a virtual good, and what the pricing strategies are in a dynamic setting when such permission choices are present. Theoretical and practical implications of the research are discussed.", "authors": [{"name": "sulin ba", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100613142"}, {"name": "dan ke", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474648573"}, {"name": "jan stallaert", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100570208"}, {"name": "zhongju zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81455605414"}], "title": "Why give away something for nothing?
