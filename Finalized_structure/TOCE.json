In this article we explore the learning effects of different instructional strategies in the context of an introductory computing course. Results suggest that asking students to do targeted tasks, albeit supported with working examples, is not the best preparation. Instead, unstructured study of examples produces superior learning. Answering targeted conceptual questions can also yield comparably positive learning but only in qualified contexts. While perhaps unintuitive, these results are consistent with a long line of research on human cognition and learning. We discuss our results in the context of this previous research and recommend effective instructional strategies, which may apply to a broad range of computational concepts.", "authors": [{"name": "craig s miller", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100160594"}, {"name": "amber settle", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81486647737"}], "title": "When Practice Doesn\u2019t Make Perfect: Effects of Task Goals on Learning Computing Concepts", "citations": [{"Name": "Ville Isom\u00f6tt\u00f6nen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ville Tirronen", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "47\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "433\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "nigeria", "university": "paul university", "affiliation_string": "depaul university", "city": "awka", "Name": "craig s miller"}, {"country": "nigeria", "university": "paul university", "affiliation_string": "depaul university", "city": "awka", "Name": "amber settle"}]}, "Article No.: 23": {"references": ["Adler, J.2000.

Since teachers are the key to the success of any high school educational initiative, any discussion of high school programs must consider the teachers, and specifically the teacher preparation needed to make the implementation of such programs possible. However, there is scant research on CS teacher education, probably because CS is a relatively young discipline. Very few of the publications in the area of CS teacher preparation are research-based. Most are descriptive papers, including recommendations for specific programs or courses. The purpose of this survey is to import from what is already known in other disciplines in this context. We therefore examine the body of research on teacher education in other disciplines, especially in mathematics and science, to shed light on important challenges for CS teacher education and draw some initial conclusions regarding CS teacher preparation programs.", "authors": [{"name": "michal armoni", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100644679"}], "title": "Looking at Secondary Teacher Preparation Through the Lens of Computer Science", "citations": [{"Name": "Sue Sentance ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mark Dorling ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Adam McNicol ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tom Crick", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michal Armoni ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Judith Gal-Ezer", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Georges-Louis Baron ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Beatrice Drot-Delange ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Monique Grandbastien ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fran\u00e7oise Tort", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sue Sentance ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mark Dorling ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Adam McNicol", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Computer science in secondary schools in the UK: ways to empower teachers", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "86\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "13\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "650\n", "Citation Count": "6\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "israel", "university": "weizmann institute of science", "affiliation_string": "weizmann institute of science", "city": "rehovot", "Name": "michal armoni"}]}, "Article No.: 24": {"references": ["Alexander, C.1964.Notes on the Synthesis of Form.

For the individual student, dropping such a course can distract from the completion of later courses in a computing curriculum and may even result in changing their course of study to a curriculum without programming. In this article, we report on how we set out to rehabilitate a troubled first programming course, one for which the dropout statistic and repercussion was evident. The five-year longitudinal case study described in this article began by systematically tracking the pass rate of a first programming course, its throughput, as proposed by the Theory of Constraints. The analyses of these data indicated three main problems in the course: programming discipline difficulty, course arrangement complexity, and limited student motivation. The motivation problem was approached from the Two-Factor Theory point of view. It investigated those factors that led to dissatisfaction among the students, the hygiene factors, and those factors that led to satisfaction, the intrinsic and extrinsic motivators. The course arrangement complexity was found to be a hygiene factor, while the lack of extrinsic and intrinsic motivators contributed to the high dropout rates. The course improvement efforts made no attempt to change the inherent characteristics of the programming discipline, but introduced holistic changes in the course arrangements over a five-year period, from 2005 to 2009, to eliminate the hygiene factors and to increase motivational aspects of the course. This systems approach to course improvement resulted in an increase in the pass rate, from 44&percnt; prior to the changes to 68&percnt; thereafter, and the overall course atmosphere turned positive. This paper reports on the detailed changes that were made and the improvements that were achieved over this five-year period.", "authors": [{"name": "uolevi nikula", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100133610"}, {"name": "orlena gotel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100315437"}, {"name": "jussi kasurinen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436602460"}], "title": "A Motivation Guided Holistic Rehabilitation of the First Programming Course", "citations": [{"Name": "Theodora Koulouri ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Stanislao Lauria ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Robert D.

Students as well as teachers rank examples as the most important resources for learning to program. Example programs work as role models and must therefore always be consistent with the principles and rules we are teaching.However, it is difficult to find or develop examples that are fully faithful to all principles and guidelines of the object-oriented paradigm and also follow general pedagogical principles and practices. Unless students are able to engage with good examples, they will not be able to tell desirable from undesirable properties in their own and others\u2019 programs.In this article we report on a study in which experienced educators evaluated the quality of object-oriented example programs for novices from popular Java textbooks. The evaluation was accomplished using an online checklist that elicited responses on the technical, object-oriented, and didactic quality of examples.In total 25 reviewers contributed 215 reviews to our dataset, based on 38 example programs from 13 common introductory programming textbooks. Results show that the evaluation instrument is reliable in terms of inter-rater agreement.

Our findings are based on the analysis of tests, questionnaires that the teachers completed in the course, as well as on observations made during the course. The article suggests that the difficulties are mostly caused by the learners\u2019 ignorance about a programming model for inheritance and polymorphism. Such a model is presented in the appendix. The article offers a classification of the difficulties into the following four clusters: (1) alternative (partial) models, (2) analogies to the use of inheritance and conversion in day-to-day life or in imperative programming, (3) lack of understanding of hierarchies and their role in inheritance, and (4) difficulties due to approaches to teaching, and their impact on the students understanding, as well as, with difficulties that arose in previous stages of learning OOP and have yet not been resolved.", "authors": [{"name": "neomi liberman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81440604918"}, {"name": "catriel beeri", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100193133"}, {"name": "yifat ben-david kolikant", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81440620321"}], "title": "Difficulties in Learning Inheritance and Polymorphism", "citations": [{"Name": "Benny Chor ", "Country": "israel", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rani Hod", "Country": "israel", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Craig S.

In this project, university students have to construct and design a type of software architecture, evaluate the architecture, implement an application based on the architecture, and test this implementation. In previous years, the domain of the software architecture project has been a robot controller for navigating a maze. In 2008, the students on the software architecture course chose between the two domains: Khepera robot simulation in Java and XNA game development in C#. Independent of the domain chosen, the students had to go through the same phases, produce the same documents based on the same templates, and follow exactly the same process. This article describes an evaluation where we wanted to investigate if a game development project could successfully be used to teach software architecture. Specifically in the evaluation, the effect of the choice of COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) and domain is compared in relation to popularity of the project type, how the students perceive the project, the complexity of the software architectures produced, the effort put into the project, and the grades achieved for the project and the written examination. The main conclusion is that game development projects can successfully be used to teach software architecture. Further, the results of the evaluation show among other things that students who chose the Game project produced software architecture with higher complexity, and put more effort into the project than the Robot project students. No significant statistical differences were found in final grades awarded to the Game project students vs. Robot project students. However, the Game project students obtained a higher grade in their project than in the written examination, whereas the Robot project students scored higher in the written examination than in their project. Finally compared to the Robot project students, those that chose the Game project had fewer problems with COTS hindering the architecture design and introducing technical challenges.", "authors": [{"name": "alf inge wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100213634"}], "title": "Extensive Evaluation of Using a Game Project in a Software Architecture Course", "citations": [{"Name": "Jussi Kasurinen ", "Country": "finland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Saeed Mirzaeifar ", "Country": "finland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Uolevi Nikula", "Country": "finland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bian Wu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alf Inge Wang", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "56\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "721\n", "Citation Count": "5\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "norwegian university of science and technology", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "alf inge wang"}]}}, "date": {"month": "February", "year": "2011"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 19": {"references": ["AccessComputing. 2009.Equal Access: Universal Design of Computing Departments.

This proactive approach holds promise for more fully including underrepresented groups in computing studies and for decreasing the need, and thus costs, for academic accommodations for students with disabilities. This article summarizes the history and development of UD, references research and practices that support the UD approach, provides examples of the strategies that apply UD to instruction and assessment, and recommends topics for future research.

We describe a multivariate investigation of male and female university students\u2019 orientation to CIS careers. We focus on the roles ofself-efficacyand peer-basedsocial supportas social-cognitive variables in the students\u2019 learning process. We explore these variables and their impact on career orientation through a set of overlapping regression models. In general, we find that strong social support and high self-efficacy are associated with strong orientation toward careers in CIS careers. However the influences of perceived self-efficacy and social support appear to differ for men and women: while low self-efficacy is tied to less social support for males, we see no similar tendency for females. In fact many females who report themselves as low in self-efficacy consider themselves to have high social support among their peers. We discuss the implications of our findings for programs aimed at outreach to both males and females regarding CIS education and careers.", "authors": [{"name": "mary beth rosson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81335496622"}, {"name": "john m carroll", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350576124"}, {"name": "hansa sinha", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81361606346"}], "title": "Orientation of Undergraduates Toward Careers in the Computer and Information Sciences: Gender, Self-Efficacy and Social Support", "citations": [{"Name": "Christopher D.

Each regional partnership is led by a STARS member college or university with partners such as local chapters of the Girl Scouts, the Black Data Processors Association, public libraries, Citizen Schools, and companies that employ computing graduates. STARS goals include retaining and graduating undergraduates and recruiting and bridging undergraduates into graduate programs. The alliance works toward these goals through activities that advance the central values of Technical Excellence, Leadership, Community, and Service and Civic Engagement. In particular, all STARS college and university members implement the STARS Leadership Corps (SLC), an innovative model for enveloping a diverse set of BPC practices within a common framework for implementation within multiple organizations, common assessment, and sustainability through curricula integration. Herein, we describe the SLC model and its implementation in the STARS schools, including details of an SLC service-learning course that has been adopted by eight STARS schools. We report the results of our three-year study of the SLC in the 20 STARS schools. Our study found a positive effect of participation in the SLC on important student success variables, including self-efficacy, perceived social relevance of computing, grade point average, and commitment to remain in computing. Results indicate that the SLC model is effective for students under-represented in computing, as well as for those not from under-represented groups.", "authors": [{"name": "teresa dahlberg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100497034"}, {"name": "tiffany barnes", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100476451"}, {"name": "kim buch", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490692130"}, {"name": "audrey rorrer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350586111"}], "title": "The STARS Alliance: Viable Strategies for Broadening Participation in Computing", "citations": [{"Name": "Miranda C.

The precollege workshops target students in grades 7--12 and engage students with robotics programming. The use of robotics at the precollege level has become popular in part due to the availability of Lego Mindstorm NXT kits. The robotics programming tools and materials used in the workshops are designed with an accessibility focus for participants with different degrees of vision. Through the use of available assistive technology and open source software, robotics is accessible to the visually impaired. The quantitative and qualitative results from three robotics workshops conducted during the past three years will be discussed, including some initial long-term results. Strategies, based on our experiences, will also be shared to promote accessible outreach. While many of the participants are in middle and early high school, findings indicate that participant interest in computing is high regardless of whether their schools offer computer science courses or not.

Hispanics constituted about 7&percnt; of undergraduate computer science and computer engineering graduates and 1&percnt; of doctoral graduates in 2007--2008. The small number of Hispanic faculty, combined with the lack of Hispanic role models and mentors, perpetuates a troublesome cycle of underrepresentation in STEM fields. In 2004, seven Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) formed the Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI) to consolidate their strengths, resources, and concerns with the aim of increasing the number of Hispanics who pursue and complete baccalaureate and advanced degrees in computing areas. To address barriers that hinder students from advancing, CAHSI defined a number of initiatives, based on programs that produced promising results at one or more institutions. These included the following: a CS-0 course that focuses on adoption of a three-unit pre-CS course that uses graphics and animation to engage and prepare students who have no prior experience in computing; a peer mentoring strategy that provides an active, collaborative learning experience for students while creating leadership roles for undergraduates; an undergraduate and graduate student research model that emphasizes the deliberate and intentional development of technical, team, and professional skills and knowledge required for research and cooperative work; and a mentoring framework for engaging undergraduates in experiences and activities that prepare them for graduate studies and onto the professoriate. CAHSI plays a critical role in evaluating, documenting, and disseminating effective practices that achieve its mission. This paper provides an overview of CAHSI initiatives and describes how each addresses causes of underrepresentation of Hispanics in computing. In addition, it describes the evaluation and assessment of the initiatives and presents the results that support CAHSI\u2019s claim of their effectiveness.", "authors": [{"name": "ann quiroz gates", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100432655"}, {"name": "sarah hug", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81482643742"}, {"name": "heather thiry", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81482660919"}, {"name": "richard alo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310502192"}, {"name": "mohsen beheshti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100421276"}, {"name": "john fernandez", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100384181"}, {"name": "nestor rodriguez", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100318791"}, {"name": "malek adjouadi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100458733"}], "title": "The Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions: Supporting Hispanics at Critical Transition Points", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "54\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "315\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of texas at el paso", "city": null, "Name": "ann quiroz gates"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado at boulder", "city": null, "Name": "sarah hug"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado at boulder", "city": null, "Name": "heather thiry"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of houston - downtown", "city": "houston", "Name": "richard alo"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "california state university - dominguez hills", "city": null, "Name": "mohsen beheshti"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "texas am university - corpus christi", "city": null, "Name": "john fernandez"}, {"country": "Puerto Rico", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of puerto rico - mayaguez", "city": "puerto rico", "Name": "nestor rodriguez"}, {"country": "philippines", "university": "national university", "affiliation_string": "florida international university", "city": "manila", "Name": "malek adjouadi"}]}, "Article No.: 17": {"references": ["Bear, G., Richards, H., and Lancaster, P.1987.

Fractal patterns---repetitions of shape at multiple scales---are a common feature in many aspects of African design. In African architecture we often see circular houses grouped in circular complexes, or rectangular houses in rectangular complexes. Typically the accompanying ceremonies, cosmologies, and other traditions make use of scaling and recursion in their conceptual models. African scaling designs include textiles, sculpture, adornment, and other forms; in many cases there are explicit geometric algorithms and other formal aspects (e.g., pseudorandom number generation in divination systems) embedded in the associated indigenous knowledge system. Thus African fractals provide a strong counter to stereotypes of African culture as primitive or simplistic. Following this fieldwork, we developed a Web site which uses Java simulations of these African designs to teach computational perspectives on fractals to high school students.1We hypothesized that this combination of anti-primitivist \u201cethnocomputing\u201d and design-based creative learning would enhance both the engagement and performance of under-represented students in computing. A quasi-experimental study used two 10th grade computing classes, both taught by the same instructor, and both including more than 50&percnt; under-represented students (Latino and African American). The control class received six days of instruction using a popular Web site (with Java applets but no cultural content or design activities) for high school fractal lessons; the experimental class received the same amount of instruction using our Web site. Pre/post differences on both achievement and attitude tests indicate statistically significant improvement for the students in the experimental class. Potential implications for improving participation and achievement of under-represented students in computing education are discussed.", "authors": [{"name": "ron eglash", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490693340"}, {"name": "mukkai krishnamoorthy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339510434"}, {"name": "jason sanchez", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490684886"}, {"name": "andrew woodbridge", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490689767"}], "title": "Fractal Simulations of African Design in Pre-College Computing Education", "citations": [{"Name": "Ron Eglash ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Juan E.

The students attend a charter high school designed to encourage low-income Latino students to attend college and attain proficiency in English, Spanish, and computers. Using data from surveys and by analyzing test scores, the authors quantify the characteristics of students who are likely to choose CS as a major. A survey of 139 tenth- through twelfth-grade Latino students is used to determine factors that influence CS major selection. The survey includes questions from a previous study (836 high school math students from 9 public and private schools) as a control. Additional questions measure student interest in 20 STEM, business, and humanities subjects. Standardized test scores are correlated with factors affecting choice of CS as a major. Environment and intervention programs in, after, and outside of school are examined to consider their impact on student development. The article provides a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the relationship among academic environment and performance, subject interests, gender, and teaching methods that influence the interest of Latino high school students in choosing CS as a major.", "authors": [{"name": "thomas g zimmerman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100030187"}, {"name": "david johnson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100455689"}, {"name": "cynthia wambsgans", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81487655612"}, {"name": "antonio fuentes", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81487640611"}], "title": "Why Latino High School Students Select Computer Science as a Major: Analysis of a Success Story", "citations": [{"Name": "Monica M.

As part of its mission to increase participation of women and underrepresented minorities in computing, the Increasing Student Participation in Research Development Program (INSPIRED) conducts computing academies for high school students. The academies are designed to increase students\u2019 knowledge of and interest in computing and to encourage females and minorities to participate in computing. INSPIRED academies differ from others in several ways. They are relatively easy to organize and require relatively few resources; they focus on computing concepts and object-oriented programming; they expose students to successful female and minority computer scientists; and they actively engage university students from underrepresented groups to organize, coordinate, teach, and help assess the academies. This not only provides role models for the high school students but also helps engage the university students and promote their professional development. Our assessment results show that high school student participants have gained significant knowledge and interest in computing through participation in the academies. This article describes the organization, coordination, content, and assessment of the academies, along with suggestions for those who would like to design academies like these. It also discusses how to prepare university students for their roles in the academies and how their participation has helped in their professional development. It includes pointers to sites from which the instructional and assessment materials can be downloaded for those who wish to replicate or adapt these materials.", "authors": [{"name": "peggy doerschuk", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100198270"}, {"name": "jiangjiang liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435605192"}, {"name": "judith mann", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332514112"}], "title": "INSPIRED High School Computing Academies", "citations": [{"Name": "Hannah Leleux ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Timothy Holcombe ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alexander Strong ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Greg Yera ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Colin Smith ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Timothy Gonzales", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Monica M.

Beginning with an account of the curricular development ofExploring Computer Science, we will describe the inquiry-based research that underlies these learning materials. Next, we argue that accompanying professional development that supports the curriculum is essential for supporting this inquiry-based approach to computer science instruction. We then explain the policy strategies used to designate this course as a college-preparatory elective and place it in 17 Los Angeles high schools. Finally, we share the initial results of how students experience this course and ongoing challenges encountered when working in the public school system. The article concludes with a discussion of how longitudinal reform effort requires a strong foundation and deep roots to successfully democratize computer science education.", "authors": [{"name": "joanna goode", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350577274"}, {"name": "jane margolis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100629796"}], "title": "Exploring Computer Science: A Case Study of School Reform", "citations": [{"Name": "Owen Astrachan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ralph Morelli ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gail Chapman ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jeff Gray", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sarah J.

Empowering women to succeed in these fields is clearly one important component of any solution. Because the population in those fields will likely continue to be overwhelmingly male for some time to come, men must also be a key component of the solution. Specifically, since the attitudes of the majority group are a strong determinant of climate, it is almost equally important to foster a population of men supportive of increasing the representation of women.As at most universities and technical companies, women are a minority in all majors in the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) College of Engineering and Information Technology (COEIT). In most majors, they are a small minority. The UMBC Center for Women and Information Technology (CWIT) is dedicated to increasing the representation of women in engineering and information technology fields. At the heart of these efforts is the CWIT Scholar Program, a selective merit scholarship program for undergraduates majoring in engineering and IT who are committed to increasing the representation of women in those fields. In addition to financial support, the CWIT Scholar Program provides a supportive community, academic and professional development programming, networking opportunities, and a residential Living Learning Community. Almost from the beginning, some CWIT scholars have been men. 28 percent of current CWIT scholars are men.Perhaps not surprisingly, female CWIT scholars have dramatically higher retention and completion rates than other women majoring in these fields. In this article, we look at a second effect of the CWIT Scholar Program, that of changing awareness and attitudes of the men who participate. We discuss programs and present results of a survey of attitudes regarding technical, academic, and gender issues in engineering and IT education. We disaggregate survey participants to show differences between the attitudes of women, scholar men, and men not participating in a diversity program.", "authors": [{"name": "penny rheingans", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100467637"}, {"name": "anne brodsky", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81487645902"}, {"name": "jill scheibler", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81487654928"}, {"name": "anne spence", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81487643660"}], "title": "The Role of Majority Groups in Diversity Programs", "citations": [{"Name": "Monica M.

We present results from a demonstration project in which interactive journalism was used to infuse computational thinking into the standard curriculum and regular classroom experience at a middle school with a diverse population. Outcomes indicate that we were able to develop positive attitudes about computational thinking and programming among students and teachers who did not necessarily view themselves as \u201cmath types.\u201d By partnering with language arts, technology and math teachers at Fisher Middle School, Ewing New Jersey, we introduced the isomorphism between the journalistic process and computational thinking to 7th and 8th graders. An intense summer institute, first with the teachers and then with students recruited from the school, immersed them in the \u201cnewsroom of the future\u201d where they researched and wrote news stories, shot and edited video, and developed procedural animations in Scratch to support their storylines.

We analyze the applicability of the taxonomy to the description of the differences in the collaboration process when visualization is used. Our hypothesis is that increasing the level of engagement between learners and the visualization tool results in a higher positive impact of the visualization on the collaboration process.

An approach to a holistic game development course is outlined in terms of its organization, software, and instructional methods. The course had 23 students enrolled in its first offering and was systematically evaluated in light of the approach using multiple sources of data. Descriptive statistics and measures of internal consistency reliability are provided. Three important findings resulted from this research: 1) a game development course can be implemented with limited institutional monetary support for a reasonable cost per student, 2) cooperation and competition can be effectively integrated into a game development course as instructional strategies, and 3) integrated lecture and computer lab sessions with cooperative learning is an effective instructional method for a game development course. Finally, insights and lessons learned are provided to assist educators in creating their own game development courses.", "authors": [{"name": "albert d ritzhaupt", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81320494051"}], "title": "Creating a Game Development Course with Limited Resources: An Evaluation Study", "citations": [{"Name": "Danu Pranantha ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Francesco Bellotti ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ricardo Berta ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alessandro De Gloria", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Paul E.

Decades of research have shown that the major problems novices experience are composition-based---they may know what the individual programming language constructs are, but they do not know how to put them together. Despite this fact, textbooks, educational practice, and programming education research hardly address the issue of teaching the skills needed for systematic development of programs.We provide a conceptual framework for incremental program development, called Stepwise Improvement, which unifies best practice in modern software development such as test-driven development and refactoring with the prevailing perspective of programming methodology, stepwise refinement. The conceptual framework enables well-defined characterizations of incremental program development.We utilize the conceptual framework to derive a programming process, STREAM, designed specifically for novices. STREAM is a carefully down-scaled version of a full and rich agile software engineering process particularly suited for novices learning object-oriented programming. In using it we hope to achieve two things: to help novice programmers learn faster and better while at the same time laying the foundation for a more thorough treatment of more advanced aspects of software engineering. In this article, two examples demonstrate the application of STREAM.The STREAM process has been taught in the introductory programming courses at our universities for the past three years and the results are very encouraging. We report on a small, preliminary study evaluating the learning outcome of teaching STREAM. The study indicates a positive effect on the development of students\u2019 process competences.", "authors": [{"name": "michael e caspersen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100366915"}, {"name": "michael kolling", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100546001"}], "title": "STREAM: A First Programming Process", "citations": [{"Name": "Ralf Romeike ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Timo G\u00f6ttel", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "V.G.

Particularly with regard to computer science lessons in secondary education, they are supposed to help novices to learn the basics of programming. In several parts of Germany (e.g., Bavaria) these fundamentals are taught as early as in the seventh grade, when pupils are 12 to 13 years old. Designed age-based learning and programming environments such as Karel the robot and Kara, the programmable ladybug, are used, but learners still underachieve. One possible approach to improving both the teaching and the learning process is to specify the knowledge concerning the learners\u2019 individual problem solving strategies, their solutions, and their respective quality.A goal of the research project described here is to design the learning environment so that it can identify and categorize several problem-solving strategies automatically. Based on this knowledge, learning and programming environments can be improved, which will optimize the computer science lessons in which they are applied. Therefore, the environments must be enhanced with special analytic and diagnostic modules, the results of which can be given to the learner in the form of individualized system feedback messages in the future.In this text preliminary considerations are demonstrated. The research methodology as well as the design and the implementation of the research instruments are explained. We describe first studies, whose results are presented and discussed.", "authors": [{"name": "ulrich kiesmuller", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81440619977"}], "title": "Diagnosing Learners\u2019 Problem-Solving Strategies Using Learning Environments with Algorithmic Problems in Secondary Education", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "44\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "645\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "friedrich-alexander university of erlangen-nuremberg", "city": null, "Name": "ulrich kiesmuller"}]}}, "date": {"month": "September", "year": "2009"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 8": {"references": ["Hundhausen, C., Douglas, S., and Stasko, J.2002.

These visualizations can help students to create concrete visual images of the algorithms and their underlying concepts. Not onlyfundamental algorithmscan be visualized, but also algorithms used in compilers. Visualizations that exist for use in compiler courses are mostly for thefrontend, though. In this article we propose the use of visualizations for understanding optimization passes. Optimization passes are complex algorithms that operate on large amounts of code and it is not obvious when, where and how often each optimization is applied to the code. We show in this article how visualizations for a procedural abstraction optimization pass can capture the effect of all instances of this optimization over an entire program to make it easier for students to comprehend procedural abstraction.", "authors": [{"name": "stefan schaeckeler", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81337492960"}, {"name": "weijia shang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81455605576"}, {"name": "ruth davis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100602844"}], "title": "Compiler Optimization Pass Visualization: The Procedural Abstraction Case", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "13\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "255\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "santa clara university", "city": null, "Name": "stefan schaeckeler"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "santa clara university", "city": null, "Name": "weijia shang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "santa clara university", "city": null, "Name": "ruth davis"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["Tuukka Ahoniemi , Essi Lahtinen, Visualizations in Preparing for Programming Exercise Sessions, Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science (ENTCS), 178, p.137-144, July, 2007[doi>10.1016/j.entcs.2007.01.043]\n", "Ayonike Akingbade , Thomas Finley , Diana Jackson , Pretesh Patel , Susan H.

Unlike experiments described in several previous papers, these experiments avoid placing students in the role of attacker. Each experiment starts with an in-class demonstration of an attack by the instructor. Students then learn how to use open-source defense tools appropriate for the role they are playing and the attack at hand. Threats covered include eavesdropping, dictionary, man-in-the-middle, port scanning, and fingerprinting attacks. Defense skills gained by students include how to forward ports with OpenSSH, how to prevent weak passwords with CrackLib, how to salt passwords, how to set up a simple certifying authority, issue and verify certificates, and guarantee communication confidentiality and integrity using OpenSSL, and how to set up firewalls and IPsec-based virtual private networks. At two separate offerings, tests taken before and after each experiment showed that each has a statistically significant and large effect on students' learning. Moreover, surveys show that students finish the sequence of experiments with high interest in further studies and work in the area of security. These results suggest that the experiments are well-suited for introductory security or networking courses.", "authors": [{"name": "jose carlos brustoloni", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100207789"}], "title": "Laboratory experiments for network security instruction", "citations": [{"Name": "Xiaohong Yuan ", "Country": "georgia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Omari T.

Those students conducted searches, obtained course information, created concept maps, collaborated in acquiring knowledge, and presented their knowledge representations. This article connects the design elements of the GetSmart system to targeted concept-map-based learning processes, describes our system and research testbed, and analyzes our system usage logs. Results suggest that students did in fact use the tools in an integrated fashion, combining knowledge representation and search activities. After concept mapping was included in the curriculum, we observed improvement in students' online quiz scores.

It also concerns more experienced programmers when complex algorithms need to be carefully explained and documented as part of software development.Good practice suggests that code and documentation be tightly coupled; but there are only a few support tools specifically targeted at novices that require this as an integral part of the programming process. We propose a new tool design with this objective in mind: P-Coder gives a flexible descriptive view of the program via pseudocode notation within a graphical tree-structured model, from which the complete algorithm can be specified to retain the informal description integrated with the final code. Thus the code meets some of the key requirements for realizing a literate program.", "authors": [{"name": "geoffrey g roy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100653203"}], "title": "Designing and explaining programs with a literate pseudocode", "citations": [{"Name": "Adrian Albin-Clark", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Birgit M\u00fcller ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Stefano Balbi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Carsten M.

This new approach incorporates a teaching hospital model originally developed for medical training. In this model, information security problems from industry and government are solved and abstracted into living-cases used for training and education of university students and public-sector employees. Such a model helps ensure that the curriculum stays current even as the field of information assurance continues to evolve. Solving industry problems hones research skills, while exposing students to living cases helps build context for concepts in information assurance. The success of this approach is contingent upon strong partnerships with government and private organizations that have real security issues as well as an active research program in information security that involves faculty and students. This article presents an implementation of this approach at CIFA. Development of the curriculum, observations gleaned through dissemination of the curriculum, and the infrastructure developed to support this concept are discussed. Evaluation of students has demonstrated the effectiveness of the \u201cteaching hospital\u201d concept and provided us with feedback to further refine its implementation.", "authors": [{"name": "sanjay goel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81327488712"}, {"name": "damira pon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329491405"}, {"name": "peter bloniarz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100117096"}, {"name": "robert bangert-drowns", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329487801"}, {"name": "george berg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100128627"}, {"name": "vince delio", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329488550"}, {"name": "laura iwan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100179597"}, {"name": "thomas hurbanek", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329489460"}, {"name": "sandoor p schuman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329492029"}, {"name": "jagdish gangolly", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329489021"}, {"name": "adnan baykal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329487711"}, {"name": "jon hobbs", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329489412"}], "title": "Innovative model for information assurance curriculum: A teaching hospital", "citations": [{"Name": "Xinli Wang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yan Bai ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Guy C.

The subject is based on a comprehensive teaching concept that was developed by the author and his colleagues during the years 1995--2000. It comprises mandatory courses in grades 6/7 for all students of grammar schools and in grade 9/10 for the students of the science and technology track of this school type. In grades 11 and 12 there are elective courses that qualify for an optional graduation exam in CS. The first students that have attended the course in total graduated in 2011. This article describes the whole project in the form of an extensive case study that is guided by theDarmstadt Model, which was developed as a category system for computer science education in secondary schools by a working group at ITiCSE 2011. This case study is the first (nearly) all-embracing discussion of the whole project that describes the long way from the original concept to the first graduates as well as the internal structure of the subject and the first results.", "authors": [{"name": "peter hubwieser", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100624459"}], "title": "Computer Science Education in Secondary Schools -- The Introduction of a New Compulsory Subject", "citations": [{"Name": "Peter Hubwieser ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michal Armoni ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michail N.

Our theoretical approach is situated at the intersection of two research traditions:distance and adult education research, which tends to be sociologically oriented, andcomputer science education research, which has strong connections with pedagogy and psychology. The article reviews contributions from both traditions on student failure in the context of higher education, distance and online education as well as introductory computer science. Our research relies on a combination of the two perspectives, which provides useful results for the field of computer science education in general, as well as its online or distance versions. The interviewed students exhibited great diversity in both socio-demographic and educational background. We identified no profiles that predicted student success or failure. At the same time, we found that expectations about programming resulted in challenges of time-management and communication. The time requirements of programming assignments were unpredictable, often disproportionate to expectations, and clashed with the external commitments of adult professionals. Too little communication was available to access adequate instructor help. On the basis of these findings, we suggest instructional design solutions for adult professionals studying introductory computer science education.", "authors": [{"name": "klara benda", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81550248556"}, {"name": "amy bruckman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100562702"}, {"name": "mark guzdial", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100467156"}], "title": "When Life and Learning Do Not Fit: Challenges of Workload and Communication in Introductory Computer Science Online", "citations": [{"Name": "Barbara J.

Several courses in computer science curricula address these low-level details such as computer architecture and assembly languages. For such courses, there are advantages to studying real architectures instead of simplified examples. However, real architectures and instruction sets introduce complexity that makes them difficult to grasp in a single semester course. Visualization techniques can help ease this burden, unfortunately existing tools are often difficult to use and consequently difficult to adopt in a course where time is already limited. To solve this problem, we present Frances. Frances graphically illustrates key differences between familiar high-level languages and unfamiliar low-level languages and also illustrates how familiar high-level programs behave on real architectures. Key to this tool is that we use a simple Web interface that requires no setup, easing course adoption hurdles. We also include several features that further enhance its usefulness in a classroom setting. These features include graphical relationships between high-level code and machine code, clearly illustrated step-by-step machine state transitions, color coding to make instruction behavior clear, and illustration of pointers. We have used Frances in courses and performed experimental evaluation. Our experiences with Frances in the classroom demonstrate its usability. Most notably, in our experimental setting, students with no computer architecture course experience were able to complete lessons using Frances with no guidance.", "authors": [{"name": "tyler sondag", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351609075"}, {"name": "kian l pokorny", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100208545"}, {"name": "hridesh rajan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323495185"}], "title": "Frances: A Tool for Understanding Computer Architecture and Assembly Language", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "90\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "13\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "361\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "iowa state university", "city": null, "Name": "tyler sondag"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "kian l pokorny"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "kian l pokorny", "city": null, "Name": "hridesh rajaniowa state university"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["Anderson, L.

This has identified discrete electronics as key components in the early stages of the curriculum and FPGAs as an economical platform for the teaching of various digital hardware design concepts and techniques in later stages of the curriculum. In particular, the article presents the detailed design and implementation of one digital hardware design laboratory, called Gateway, which introduces students to synchronous digital circuit development from high level functional specifications, uses Verilog for hardware description and FPGAs as an implementation platform. Biggs\u2019 theory of constructive alignment was applied in the design of this lab\u2019s learning outcomes, lab content, teaching and learning methods, and assessment methods. The lab makes extensive use of multimedia in both lab content delivery and demonstration applications developed by students.

There have been several types of robots that have been used extensively in the classroom to teach a variety of computer science concepts. A more recently introduced robot designed to teach programming to novice students is the Institute for Personal Robots in Education (IPRE) robot. The author chose to use this robot and study its motivational effects on non-computer science students in a CS0 course. The purpose of this study was to determine whether using the IPRE robots motivates students to learn programming in a CS0 course. After considering various motivational theories and instruments designed to measure motivation, the author used Keller\u2019s Instructional Materials Motivation Survey to measure four components of motivation: attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction. Additional items were added to the survey, including a set of open-ended questions. The results of this study indicate that the use of these robots had a positive influence on participants\u2019 attitudes towards learning to program in a CS0 course, but little or no effect on relevance, confidence, or satisfaction. Results also indicate that although gender and students interests may affect individual components of motivation, gender, technical self-perception, and interest in software development have no bearing on the overall motivational levels of students.", "authors": [{"name": "monica m mcgill", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81312482025"}], "title": "Learning to Program with Personal Robots: Influences on Student Motivation", "citations": [{"Name": "Gabriel J.

This unethical behavior seriously threatens the integrity of the academic system, and teachers invest substantial effort in preventing and recognizing plagiarism.When students take examinations requiring the production of computer programs, plagiarism detection can be semiautomated using analysis techniques such as JPlag and Moss. These techniques are useful but lose effectiveness when the text of the exam suggests some of the elements that should be structurally part of the solution. A loss of effectiveness is caused by the many common parts that are shared between programs due to the suggestions in the text of the exam rather than plagiarism.In this article, we present the AuDeNTES anti-plagiarism technique. AuDeNTES detects plagiarism via the code fragments that better represent the individual students\u2019 contributions by filtering from students\u2019 submissions the parts that might be common to many students due to the suggestions in the text of the exam. The filtered parts are identified by comparing students\u2019 submissions against a reference solution, which is a solution of the exam developed by the teachers. Specifically, AuDeNTES first produces tokenized versions of both the reference solution and the programs that must be analyzed. Then, AuDeNTES removes from the tokenized programs the tokens that are included in the tokenized reference solution. Finally, AuDeNTES computes the similarity among the filtered tokenized programs and produces a ranked list of program pairs suspected of plagiarism.An empirical comparison against multiple state-of-the-art plagiarism detection techniques using several sets of real students\u2019 programs collected in early programming courses demonstrated that AuDeNTES identifies more plagiarism cases than the other techniques at the cost of a small additional inspection effort.", "authors": [{"name": "leonardo mariani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100398370"}, {"name": "daniela micucci", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100545552"}], "title": "AuDeNTES: Automatic Detection of teNtative plagiarism according to a rEference Solution", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "48\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "343\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "italy", "university": "university of milan", "affiliation_string": "university of milano bicocca", "city": "milan", "Name": "leonardo mariani"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of milan", "affiliation_string": "university of milano bicocca", "city": "milan", "Name": "daniela micucci"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2012"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Amabile, T.

In the Finnish computer science education the teaching mostly follows a pattern of lectures, fixed exercise sets, and exams. With this article we want to open a discussion about possibilities of enhancing the learning environment by focusing on creative problem solving. We will present results from two research experiments in which we aimed to provide computer science students with a practically oriented learning environment with an explicit intention of supporting the creative work of students. There exists a vast amount of scientific theory about creativity, yet it is unclear on how to turn that theory into practice. Thus, our main interest was to find ways of applying creativity theory in practice in the context of computer science education.Our research experiments consist of a practically oriented computer science course, where LEGO\u00aeMindstorms robots were used as the platform for the student work. Methodological tools used in this study included content analysis of student products, observations from our learning sessions and semi-structured interviews with the students. The course was organised two times: the first time was in spring 2009 and the second in spring 2010. The total number of attending students was 72.In this article we argue that our approach of providing a creativity-supporting practical computer science course was a success. We gained a lot of ideas on how to support creativity, the students were clearly motivated, and they began to learn a new kind of experimental working style. The robotics kit seemed to work well both as a trigger for motivation and as a platform to support experimental learning, enhancing students\u2019 creativity and working style.In our opinion these findings are of great importance, and give promising practical ideas for the support of creativity in higher computer science education.", "authors": [{"name": "mikko apiola", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81464674991"}, {"name": "matti lattu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100031939"}, {"name": "tomi a pasanen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100086481"}], "title": "Creativity-Supporting Learning Environment---CSLE", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "125\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "12\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "790\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "finland", "university": "university of helsinki", "affiliation_string": "university of helsinki", "city": "helsinki", "Name": "mikko apiola"}, {"country": "finland", "university": "university of helsinki", "affiliation_string": "university of helsinki", "city": "helsinki", "Name": "matti lattu"}, {"country": "finland", "university": "university of helsinki", "affiliation_string": "university of helsinki", "city": "helsinki", "Name": "tomi a pasanen"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["ACM2005.

Likewise, the identification of appropriate instructional strategies for the diverse topics that constitute the average curriculum remains open to debate. One approach considered by a number of practitioners in CS education involves Problem-Based Learning (PBL), a radical departure from the conventional lecturing format. PBL has been adopted in other domains with success, but whether these positive experiences will be replicated in CS remains to be seen. In this article, a systematic review of PBL initiatives in undergraduate and postgraduate CS is presented from a Computing Education Research (CER) perspective. This includes analyses of a range of practical didactic issues, including the degree to which PBL has been systematically evaluated, practical problem description in the literature, as well as a survey of topics for which a PBL approach has been adopted.", "authors": [{"name": "michael j ogrady", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81504687484"}], "title": "Practical Problem-Based Learning in Computing Education", "citations": [{"Name": "Luca Gherardi ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Davide Brugali ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andrea Luzzana", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Varvara Garneli ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michail N.

Indeed, it is essential to consider pedagogical forms whose objective is providing learners with field experience. It is also necessary to motivate learners to learn about subjects that sometimes seem distant from their immediate concerns and to renew their interest in these subjects. This article presents a tool, called GRASP, that helps design pedagogical devices. This tool was first evaluated through three educational initiatives implemented in two universities in the north of France. These initiatives were analyzed to enhance the tool. Then, a second evaluation was conducted to validate the tool more widely. The first part of this article presents the scientific context. Then the design tool, the evaluation protocol, and the three devices built using this tool and their evaluation are introduced. Some of the lessons learned during the initiatives are described.

In order to address these difficulties, a series of learning activities called Computer Science Unplugged was developed by Tim Bell and his colleagues. These activities expose young people to central concepts in CS in an entertaining way without requiring a computer. The CS Unplugged activities have become more and more popular among CS educators and several activities are recommended in the ACM K-12 curriculum for elementary schools. CS Unplugged is used worldwide and has been translated into many languages.We examined the effect of the CS Unplugged activities on middle-school students\u2019 ideas about CS and their desire to consider and study it in high school. The results indicate that following the activities the ideas of the students on what CS is about were partially improved, but their desire to study CS lessened.In order to provide possible explanations to these results, we analyzed the CS Unplugged activities to determine to what extent the objectives of CS Unplugged were addressed in the activities. In addition, we checked whether the activities were designed according to constructivist principles and whether they were explicitly linked to central concepts in CS. We found that only some of the objectives were addressed in the activities, that the activities do not engage with the students\u2019 prior knowledge and that most of the activities are not explicitly linked to central concepts in CS. We offer suggestions for modifying the CS Unplugged activities so that they will be more likely to achieve their objectives.", "authors": [{"name": "rivka taub", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436597880"}, {"name": "michal armoni", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100644679"}, {"name": "mordechai ben-ari", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100485679"}], "title": "CS Unplugged and Middle-School Students\u2019 Views, Attitudes, and Intentions Regarding CS", "citations": [{"Name": "Thomas J.

Following the sharp rise in the number of computer and video games courses across higher education (HE) institutions in the UK and across the globe, this article examines the composition of existing British games design, development, and art programs in relation to prescribed study areas voiced by industry bodies. From a sample of 242 courses, and a further 11 industry-derived and accredited programs, the results explore content currently residing within a variety of games programs and qualification types and evaluate the extent to which such content adheres to the industry\u2019s demand for the focus on specific skills and study areas. The findings point toward certain shortfalls in some key areas deemed to be important by industry professionals and the consideration of the degree to which course providers should cater to the specific demands of industry.", "authors": [{"name": "barry ip", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413607505"}], "title": "Fitting the Needs of an Industry: An Examination of Games Design, Development, and Art Courses in the UK", "citations": [{"Name": "Jussi Kasurinen ", "Country": "finland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Saeed Mirzaeifar ", "Country": "finland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Uolevi Nikula", "Country": "finland", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "77\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "19\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "453\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": []}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["ABIresesarch. 2006.

In response, postsecondary institutions in the UK and the U.S. have started to create game degree programs. Though curriculum theorists provide insight into the process of creating a new program, no formal research contextualizes curriculum planning for game degree programs. The purpose of this research was to explore these processes when planning undergraduate game degree programs. The research methodology included an explanatory mixed-methods approach, using a quantitative survey of participants in the UK and the U.S., followed by interviews with several participants selected on the basis of their institution\u2019s demographics. Results indicate that five external factors influence the development of game programs (government, industry, other universities, society, and trade associations) and eight internal factors influence curriculum planning (facilities, faculty, institution, interdisciplinary collaboration, learners, learning time and space, originating department, and backgrounds of the planners). Results also indicate that while some differences exist in the game degree programs across countries, the vast majority of curriculum planning processes and influencing factors are the same. The study concludes with a set of recommendations for educators, trade associations, and the games industry to improve game degree programs.", "authors": [{"name": "monica m mcgill", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81312482025"}], "title": "The Curriculum Planning Process for Undergraduate Game Degree Programs in the United Kingdom and United States", "citations": [{"Name": "Monica M.

Our work and results are potentially valuable to CS educators in three ways: (1) They validate the usefulness of the survey instrument in assessing pedagogies in usability engineering, (2) They provide useful insights into the attitudes of CS majors relative to the important topics of usability and accessibility, and (3) They point to possible benefits of including usability and accessibility topics into CS curricula.", "authors": [{"name": "g michael poor", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81444601879"}, {"name": "laura m leventhal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100373608"}, {"name": "julie barnes", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100476942"}, {"name": "duke r hutchings", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100006226"}, {"name": "paul albee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100603783"}, {"name": "laura campbell", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81541489156"}], "title": "No User Left Behind: Including Accessibility in Student Projects and the Impact on CS Students\u2019 Attitudes", "citations": [{"Name": "Vicki L.

While this syntax barrier is known to exist, whether and how it varies across programming languages has not been carefully investigated. For this article, we conducted four empirical studies on programming language syntax as part of a larger analysis into the, so called, programming language wars. We first present two surveys conducted with students on the intuitiveness of syntax, which we used to garner formative clues on what words and symbols might be easy for novices to understand. We followed up with two studies on the accuracy rates of novices using a total of six programming languages: Ruby, Java, Perl, Python, Randomo, and Quorum. Randomo was designed by randomly choosing some keywords from the ASCII table (a metaphorical placebo). To our surprise, we found that languages using a more traditional C-style syntax (both Perl and Java) did not afford accuracy rates significantly higher than a language with randomly generated keywords, but that languages which deviate (Quorum, Python, and Ruby) did. These results, including the specifics of syntax that are particularly problematic for novices, may help teachers of introductory programming courses in choosing appropriate first languages and in helping students to overcome the challenges they face with syntax.", "authors": [{"name": "andreas stefik", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314486348"}, {"name": "susanna siebert", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490684517"}], "title": "An Empirical Investigation into Programming Language Syntax", "citations": [{"Name": "Andreas Stefik ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Richard E.

We present a didactic method aimed at promoting active learning of greedy algorithms. The method is focused on the concept of selection function, and is based on explicit learning goals. It mainly consists of an experimental method and the interactive system, GreedEx, that supports it. We also present our experience of five years using the didactic method and the evaluations we conducted to refine it, which are of two kinds: usability evaluations of GreedEx and analysis of students\u2019 reports. Usability evaluations revealed a number of opportunities of improvement for GreedEx, and the analysis of students\u2019 reports showed a number of misconceptions. We made use of these findings in several ways, mainly: improving GreedEx, elaborating lecture notes that address students\u2019 misconceptions, and adapting the class and lab sessions and materials. As a consequence of these actions, our didactic method currently satisfies its initial goals. The article has two main contributions. First, the didactic method itself can be valuable for computer science educators in their teaching of algorithms. Secondly, the refinement process we have carried out, which was a multifaceted, medium-term action research, can be of interest to researchers of technology-supported computing education, since it illustrates how the didactic method was integrated into our educational practice.", "authors": [{"name": "j angel velazquez-iturbide", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81503670374"}], "title": "An Experimental Method for the Active Learning of Greedy Algorithms", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "57\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "243\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "spain", "university": "universidad rey juan carlos", "affiliation_string": "universidad rey juan carlos", "city": "madrid", "Name": "j angel velazquez-iturbide"}]}, "Article No.: 16": {"references": ["Joseph Brian Adams, Computational science as a twenty-first century discipline in the liberal arts, Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges, v.23 n.5, p.15-23, May 2008\n", "Agresti, A. 2007.An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis.

The research questions driving this study were: (1) Can experiences with discipline-based computing promote students\u2019 acquisition and application of foundational computing concepts and procedures? (2) How do students perceive and experience the integration of discipline-based computing as relevant to their future career goals? (3) How do students perceive the structure of the class as useful and engaging for their learning? We used qualitative and quantitative research methods to approach the research questions. The population studied was 20 engineering undergraduates from Johns Hopkins University. Results of this study suggest that students performed proficiently in applying computing methods, procedures, and concepts to the solution of well-structured engineering problems. Results also suggest that student self-perceptions of their overall computing abilities and their abilities to specifically solve engineering problems shifted from low to high confidence. Students consistently found the course to be important and useful for their studies and their future careers. They also found the course to be of very high quality and identified the instructors and the teaching and feedback methods employed as very useful for their learning. Finally, students also described the course as very challenging compared with other courses in their own department and at the university in general.", "authors": [{"name": "alejandra j magana", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81501642985"}, {"name": "michael l falk", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84459666257"}, {"name": "michael j reese", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84459171557"}], "title": "Introducing Discipline-Based Computing in Undergraduate Engineering Education", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "76\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "274\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "purdue university", "city": null, "Name": "alejandra j magana"}, {"country": "Belize", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "johns hopkins university", "city": "hopkins", "Name": "michael l falk"}, {"country": "Belize", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "johns hopkins university", "city": "hopkins", "Name": "michael j reese jr"}]}, "Article No.: 17": {"references": ["3D Studio Max. 2012. http://usa.autodesk.com/3ds-max/.\n", "ACM CS Curriculum. 2008. http://www.acm.org/education/curricula/ComputerScience2008.pdf.\n", "Anderson, E.

This constraint is relevant to many small and medium-sized colleges that lack resources, adequate expertise, and enrollment to sustain multiple courses in graphics that spread out its vast and evolving content. We strive to include material that would provide (1) a basic but solid theoretical foundation, (2) topics, data structures, and algorithms that are most practically used, (3) ample experience in actual graphics programming and (4) a basic awareness of advanced topics. We have a secondary objective of relating and complementing computer graphics knowledge and programming with topics in other computer science courses to provide a more cohesive understanding to our students. We achieve both objectives by using an \u201cearly-scenegraphs\u201d approach to progressively create graphics applications that use XML-based modeling and both pipeline-based and ray traced rendering. We report and analyze results that show how students were able to achieve more complex results within similar time periods while largely retaining prior average student performance in the course. Students also report higher rates of satisfaction with the course when it follows our proposed approach. Pedagogically our main contribution is an evolving blueprint for a single undergraduate CG course that offers flexibility to emphasize different aspects like modeling, rendering, etc. according to the instructor\u2019s and students\u2019 interests, while aligning the course better within the computer science curriculum especially when resources are limited.", "authors": [{"name": "amit shesh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435606599"}], "title": "Toward a Singleton Undergraduate Computer Graphics Course in Small and Medium-sized Colleges", "citations": [{"Name": "Bryson R.

Our focus is on generic systems that are capable of illustrating many kinds of programs and behaviors. We inclusively describe such systems from the last three decades and review findings from their empirical evaluations. A comparable review on the topic does not previously exist; ours is intended to serve as a reference for the creators, evaluators, and users of educational program visualization systems. Moreover, we revisit the issue of learner engagement which has been identified as a potentially key factor in the success of educational software visualization and summarize what little is known about engagement in the context of the generic program visualization systems for beginners that we have reviewed; a proposed refinement of the frameworks previously used by computing education researchers to rank types of learner engagement is a side product of this effort. Overall, our review illustrates that program visualization systems for beginners are often short-lived research prototypes that support the user-controlled viewing of program animations; a recent trend is to support more engaging modes of user interaction. The results of evaluations largely support the use of program visualization in introductory programming education, but research to date is insufficient for drawing more nuanced conclusions with respect to learner engagement. On the basis of our review, we identify interesting questions to answer for future research in relation to themes such as engagement, the authenticity of learning tasks, cognitive load, and the integration of program visualization into introductory programming pedagogy.", "authors": [{"name": "juha sorva", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81416600613"}, {"name": "ville karavirta", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100174108"}, {"name": "lauri malmi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548029562"}], "title": "A Review of Generic Program Visualization Systems for Introductory Programming Education", "citations": [{"Name": "Amruth N.

For example, multicore programming and parallel systems are highly desired courses in the computer science major. However, the high cost of HPC equipment and maintenance makes it hard to be adapted into a conventional computer science curriculum. Specifically, teaching-oriented institutions cannot afford an HPC system due to the high cost, lack of experience, and smaller research infrastructure. The main objective of this article is to present an affordable and easy-to-use high-performance cluster system for teaching-oriented computer science curriculums. In order to address this, we have designed and implemented an affordable high-performance cluster system based on the PlayStation 3 (PS3). For the performance evaluation of the PS3 cluster, we conducted a benchmarking test, that is, matrix multiplication, with different numbers of synergistic processing elements (SPEs) and nodes. As a result, it was concluded that the PS3Cluster provides enough computing power as an HPC for computer science courses, while the total cost is less than 10&percnt; of an existing cluster system on the market that has similar performance. In addition, the implemented PS3Cluster system has been used for computer science courses, such as Parallel and Distributed Databases and Parallel Programming.", "authors": [{"name": "omar abuzaghleh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81553284156"}, {"name": "kathleen goldschmidt", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81553258056"}, {"name": "yasser elleithy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81553126156"}, {"name": "jeongkyu lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81552889756"}], "title": "Implementing an affordable high-performance computing for teaching-oriented computer science curriculum", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "58\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "314\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of bridgeport bridgeport ct", "city": null, "Name": "omar abuzaghleh"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of bridgeport bridgeport ct", "city": null, "Name": "kathleen goldschmidt"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of bridgeport bridgeport ct", "city": null, "Name": "yasser elleithy"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of bridgeport bridgeport ct", "city": null, "Name": "jeongkyu lee"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2414446.2414447", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "Much of computing education research is devoted to introductory computer science.

The main practical difference with other approaches lies in the fact that the ability to develop correct concurrent software relies on a systematic transformation of formal models of inter-process interaction (so calledshared resources), rather than on the specific constructs of some programming language. Using a resource-centric rather than a language-centric approach has some benefits for both teachers and students. Besides the obvious advantage of being independent of the programming language, the models help in the early validation of concurrent software design, provide students and teachers with alingua francathat greatly simplifies communication at the classroom and during supervision, and help in the automatic generation of tests for the practical assignments. This method has been in use, with slight variations, for some 15 years, surviving changes in the programming language and course length. In this article, we describe the components and structure of the current incarnation of the course\u2014which uses Java as target language\u2014and some tools used to support our method. We provide a detailed description of the different outcomes that the model-driven approach delivers (validation of the initial design, automatic generation of tests, and mechanical generation of code) from a teaching perspective. A critical discussion on the perceived advantages and risks of our approach follows, including some proposals on how these risks can be minimized. We include a statistical analysis to show that our method has a positive impact in the student ability to understand concurrency and to generate correct code.", "authors": [{"name": "manuel carro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100352554"}, {"name": "angel herranz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350581883"}, {"name": "julio marino", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100602588"}], "title": "A model-driven approach to teaching concurrency", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "43\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "392\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "spain", "university": "universidad politecnica de madrid", "affiliation_string": "universidad politecnica de madrid and imdea software institute", "city": "madrid", "Name": "manuel carro"}, {"country": "spain", "university": "universidad politecnica de madrid", "affiliation_string": "universidad politecnica de madrid", "city": "madrid", "Name": "angel herranz"}, {"country": "spain", "university": "universidad politecnica de madrid", "affiliation_string": "universidad politecnica de madrid", "city": "madrid", "Name": "julio marino"}]}}, "date": {"month": "January", "year": "2013"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Alexander, M.

This article briefly reviews the principles of cooperative learning, and describes how these principles were incorporated into a comprehensive set of cooperative learning activities for a CS1 course. In each activity, specific roles are assigned to group members in order to highlight important concepts and to enhance the overall functioning of the group. The group processing is followed by a whole-class debriefing led by the instructor, which works in tandem with the group activity to help students improve their understanding of the material. The effectiveness of these cooperative learning activities was assessed in a series of educational research studies which spanned three academic years and included two different instructors. The results of these studies show statistically significant benefits from the cooperative learning approach, both overall and for a broad range of subgroups of students.

PI lectures present students with a series of multiple-choice questions, which they respond to both individually and in groups. PI has been widely successful in the physical sciences and, recently, has been successfully adopted by computer science instructors in lower-division, introductory courses. In this work, we challenge readers to consider PI for their upper-division courses as well. We present a PI curriculum for two upper-division computer science courses: Computer Architecture and Theory of Computation. These courses exemplify several perceived challenges to the adoption of PI in upper-division courses, including: exploration of abstract ideas, development of high-level judgment of engineering design trade-offs, and exercising advanced mathematical sophistication. This work includes selected course materials illustrating how these challenges are overcome, learning gains results comparing these upper-division courses with previous lower-division results in the literature, student attitudinal survey results (N = 501), and pragmatic advice to prospective developers and adopters. We present three main findings. First, we find that these upper-division courses achieved student learning gains equivalent to those reported in successful lower-division computing courses. Second, we find that student feedback for each class was overwhelmingly positive, with 88&percnt; of students recommending PI for use in other computer science classes. Third, we find that instructors adopting the materials introduced here were able to replicate the outcomes of the instructors who developed the materials in terms of student learning gains and student feedback.", "authors": [{"name": "cynthia bailey lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82659114957"}, {"name": "saturnino garcia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82258830557"}, {"name": "leo porter", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435603332"}], "title": "Can peer instruction be effective in upper-division computer science courses?", "citations": [{"Name": "Michael S.

Based on our combined years of experience, however, one of our students' abiding shortcomings is that they think there is onlyone correct answerto issues in most courses: anidealisticstance. Human-centered security, as well as other areas, requires students to understand that they have to weigh up a number of different possible solutions, and satisfice, rather than choose the one that is undeniably the best. In other words, they need to adopt a morerealisticstance. Lecture-based teaching cannot develop this facility, due to its inability to engage students deeply with the issues and possible solutions. We argue thatdepth(in terms of understanding the complexity and issues involved) as well asbreadth(in terms of appreciating the different positions taken by users on these issues) are essential for developing the realistic stance. This article reports on an instructional design that was used to help students become more realistic in their decision making. The design is based on seven educational strategies that, in tandem, help students to see the depth and breadth of topics in the course. We detail the instructional design and its application to three topic areas in the course, and report on the outcomes. We found evidence that students did indeed develop the depth and breadth we were hoping for. In concluding, we reflect on the design and the positive result, and propose changes to further improve the course.", "authors": [{"name": "karen renaud", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81342508954"}, {"name": "quintin cutts", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100292602"}], "title": "Teaching human-centered security using nontraditional techniques", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "78\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "294\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of glasgow", "affiliation_string": "university of glasgow glasgow uk", "city": "glasgow", "Name": "karen renaud"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of glasgow", "affiliation_string": "university of glasgow glasgow uk", "city": "glasgow", "Name": "quintin cutts"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Agrawal, A. 2009.

Toward that end, we have developed an active learning approach for computing education called thePedagogical Code Review(PCR). Inspired by thecode inspectionprocess used in the software industry, a PCR is a collaborative activity in which a small team of students, led by a trained moderator: (a) walk through segments of each other's programming solutions, (b) check the code against a list of best coding practices, and (c) discuss and log issues that arise. To evaluate the viability and effectiveness of this approach, we conducted a series of four mixed-method empirical studies of various implementations of PCRs in CS1 courses at Washington State University. The first study validated the viability of the PCR activity. Using a quasi-experimental design, the final three studies evaluated two alternative implementations of PCRs\u2014face-to-faceandonline. Our results provide evidence that PCRs can promote positive attitudinal shifts, and hone skills in critical review, teamwork, and communication.

Increased adoption of these instructional practices is recommended in several prominent national reports as well as a new National Science Foundation program. The goal of this special issue is to share evidence-based instructional practices that have been applied to computer science education. Withcollaborative learning, students interact with each other to achieve a common learning goal.Peer Instructionis an active pedagogy pioneered in Physics education in which most lecture time is replaced with students answering carefully designed multiple-choice questions. Chemistry faculty developed and refined aninquiry-based pedagogycalled Process-Oriented Guided-Inquiry Learning (POGIL).

More specifically, the review covers the literature on programming misconceptions, the cognitive theory of mental models, constructivist theory of knowledge and learning, phenomenographic research on experiencing programming, and the theory of threshold concepts. These bodies of work are examined in relation to the concept of a \u201cnotional machine\u201d\u2014an abstract computer for executing programs of a particular kind. As a whole, the literature points to notional machines as a major challenge in introductory programming education. It is argued that instructors should acknowledge the notional machine as an explicit learning objective and address it in teaching. Teaching within some programming paradigms, such as object-oriented programming, may benefit from using multiple notional machines at different levels of abstraction. Pointers to some promising pedagogical techniques are provided.", "authors": [{"name": "juha sorva", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81416600613"}], "title": "Notional machines and introductory programming education", "citations": [{"Name": "Axel W.

With massed classrooms, in particular, it tends to constrain the active participation of students. One of the remedies applied to programming education is to use technology that can vitalize interaction in the classroom, while another is to base teaching increasingly on programming activities. In this article, we present the first results of an exploratory study, in which we teach programming without lectures, exams, or grades, by heavily emphasizing programming activity, and, in a pedagogical sense, student self-direction. This article investigates how students reacted to the active role required of them and what issues emerged in this setting where self-direction was required. The results indicate three issues that should be taken into account when designing a student-driven course: the challenge of supporting students' theoretical synthesis of the topics to be learned, the individual's opportunities for self-direction in a group work setting, and mismatch between individual learning processes and academic course scheduling.", "authors": [{"name": "ville isomottonen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375606133"}, {"name": "ville tirronen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418592968"}], "title": "Teaching programming by emphasizing self-direction: How did students react to the active role required of them?", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "117\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "12\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "527\n", "Citation Count": "4\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "finland", "university": "university of jyvaskyla", "affiliation_string": "university of jyvaskyla finland", "city": "jyvaskyla", "Name": "ville isomottonen"}, {"country": "finland", "university": "university of jyvaskyla", "affiliation_string": "university of jyvaskyla finland", "city": "jyvaskyla", "Name": "ville tirronen"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Joel C.

Students were given minimal instructions on what to include in their drawings in order to see what they considered to be central concepts and relationships in program execution. Three drawing tasks were given at different phases of an elementary OO programming course where two animation tools were used for program visualization. The drawings were analyzed for their overall approaches and their detailed contents.There was a large variability in the overall approaches and the popularity of various approaches changed during the course. The results indicate that students' mental representations of OO concepts and program execution not only grow as new material is covered in teaching, but they also change. The first drawings treat methods as having primarily a static existence; later methods are seen as dynamic invocations that call each other. The role of classes in program execution fluctuates during learning, indicating problems in locating the notion of class with respect to, for example, objects. Two major sources of problems that manifested in many different forms were the relationship between object and method, and the role of the main method with respect to program state. Other problems were caused by overly simplistic understanding of object identification and improper use of application domain knowledge.", "authors": [{"name": "jorma sajaniemi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100654475"}, {"name": "marja kuittinen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100237450"}, {"name": "taina tikansalo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350571380"}], "title": "A study of the development of students' visualizations of program state during an elementary object-oriented programming course", "citations": [{"Name": "Craig S.

This set of papers can therefore serve as examplars and resources for the educator wishing to develop a wider range of tools for probing issues of teaching and learning within the classroom.", "authors": [{"name": "josh tenenberg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100296642"}, {"name": "robert mccartney", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100566786"}], "title": "Linking questions and evidence", "citations": [{"Name": "Josh Tenenberg ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Robert McCartney", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Josh Tenenberg ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Robert McCartney", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "7\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "336\n", "Citation Count": "4\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of washington tacoma", "city": "washington", "Name": "josh tenenberg"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of connecticut", "city": null, "Name": "robert mccartney"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Brian F.

These successes have led to a rise in use of pair programming in educational settings, particularly in Computer Science 1 (CS1). Specifically, McDowell et al. [2006] has shown that students using pair programming in CS1 do better in a CS2 class (with solo programming) than students who don't pair in CS1. This paper seeks to address a similar question, but from a qualitative, student-focused approach. How do students define, experience, and value the pair programming experience? How do they experience and value it compared to solo programming? Does pairing in CS1 impact their confidence in their abilities?We report on semi-structured interviews with 11 subjects from two institutions where pair programming was used in CS1, and solo programming was used in the CS2. Many of the responses met our expectations; students get stuck less and explore more ideas while pairing, and believe that pair programming helped them in CS1. Other responses were more surprising. Students reported that when solo programming they were more confident and understood their programs better. Many students also said that they started work on their assignments earlier when soloing. Students also continue to use other students as resources even when working \"solo.\"", "authors": [{"name": "beth simon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100527028"}, {"name": "brian hanks", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100528961"}], "title": "First-year students' impressions of pair programming in CS1", "citations": [{"Name": "Grant Braught ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tim Wahls ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "L.

In this report, we consider the role of context in a second course. We present a case study of a CS2 data structures class that uses a media computation context. In this course, students learn data structures and object-oriented (OO) programming through a pervasive narrative about how real media professionals use data structures to model the real world and to construct the digital images, sounds, and animations with which the students are familiar in their daily lives. We found that context played a different role in a second course than in a first course. We found evidence that some students did not need context to appreciate computing, but we also found evidence that context can help students get engaged with the material that they otherwise do not find interesting. In particular, the narrative aspect of a context may help students in relating the elements of the course and may even help with learning.", "authors": [{"name": "svetlana yarosh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350580946"}, {"name": "mark guzdial", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100467156"}], "title": "Narrating data structures: The role of context in CS2", "citations": [{"Name": "Eric Andrew Freudenthal ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mary K.

After discussing their choice with others in the class, students could change their hiring decisions. Students' hiring criteria were coded using emergent categories, inferences in the arguments were coded according to the criteria, and reasons for changing hiring decisions were coded. Students considered criteria that fell into five areas: technical skills, soft skills, personal traits, previous employment, and career/job considerations. Reasons for changing hiring choices included previous experience, diversity considerations, people skills, leadership skills, and reaching consensus.

From these two design representations, students implement a data-driven Web site that enables users to browse content and search by exact and best-match queries. The project brief contains a set of general requirements that promote creative solutions, while also bounding the complexity of the solution space. The article includes teaching notes and a conceptual model, expressed as an enhanced entity-relationship model in UML. The model, consisting of approximately ten entities, contains binary, unary, ternary, and specialization/generalization relationships.

Unfortunately, in most academic environments, there are not enough experts to provide any significant design mentoring for software engineering students. To address this problem, we present a collaborative software design tool intended to maximize an instructor's ability to mentor a group of students. Students use the system to create software designs for a given set of requirements. While they work, students receive automated feedback regarding common design mistakes. The system then provides support and guidance for students to manually critique each other's work. Students can view and learn from the design approaches taken by other students, as well as the critiques associated with them. We have tried this approach in software engineering classes with some positive results. We believe that this collaborative and partially automated approach can significantly improve the quality of software design education when few mentors are available.", "authors": [{"name": "wesley coelho", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81324488597"}, {"name": "gail murphy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81336491450"}], "title": "ClassCompass: A software design mentoring system", "citations": [{"Name": "Y.

Diagrams have partial and sometimes inconsistent semantics. Typically much of the meaning of a diagram resides in the labels; however, the choice of labeling is largely unrestricted. This means a correct solution may utilize differing yet semantically equivalent labels to the specimen solution. With human marking this problem can be easily overcome. Unfortunately with e-assessment this is challenging. We empirically explore the scale of the problem of synonyms by analyzing 160 student solutions to a UML task. From this we find that cumulative growth of synonyms only shows a limited tendency to reduce at the margin despite using a range of text processing algorithms such as stemming and auto-correction of spelling errors. This finding has significant implications for the ease in which we may develop future e-assessment systems of diagrams, in that the need for better algorithms for assessing label semantic similarity becomes inescapable.", "authors": [{"name": "ambikesh jayal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413605043"}, {"name": "martin shepperd", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100330154"}], "title": "The Problem of Labels in E-Assessment of Diagrams", "citations": [{"Name": "Kevin A.

To address this priority, higher education has gradually incorporated the principles of computer and information security into the mainstream undergraduate and graduate computer science curricula. To achieve effective education, learning security principles must be grounded in experience. This calls for effective laboratory exercises (or course projects). Although a number of laboratories have been designed for security education, they only cover a small portion of the fundamental security principles. Moreover, their underlying lab environments are different, making integration of these laboratories infeasible for a semester-long course. Currently, security laboratories that can be widely adopted are still lacking, and they are in great demand in security education.We have developed a novel laboratory environment (referred to as SEED). The SEED environment consists of Minix, an instructional operating system (OS), and Linux, a production OS; it takes advantage of the simplicity of Minix and the completeness of Linux, and provides a unified platform to support a rich set of laboratories for computer security education.

We describe three recent case studies designed to evaluate the effectiveness of assigning graduate-level computer vision students with publicly available research benchmarks as competitive assignments. This was done rather than assigning more traditional exercises that require students to implement specific algorithms or applications. We allowed our students the freedom of designing or choosing their own methods, with the goal of obtaining the best performance on the benchmark chosen for each assignment. Students, therefore, competed against each other, as well as published state of the art. We detail the design, application, and results of these benchmark exercises. We show that not only are these benchmarks easily adapted for the classroom, but also that in some cases, student assignments matched published state-of-the-art performance. This observation provides strong evidence to support the effectiveness of the proposed exercise design. We conclude by discussing the benefits and drawbacks of these exercises compared to those traditionally employed in computer vision classrooms.", "authors": [{"name": "tal hassner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81317494818"}, {"name": "itzik bayaz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658689389"}], "title": "Teaching Computer Vision: Bringing Research Benchmarks to the Classroom", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "204\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "233\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "open university", "affiliation_string": "the open university of israel israel", "city": "milton keynes", "Name": "tal hassner"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "open university", "affiliation_string": "the open university of israel israel", "city": "milton keynes", "Name": "itzik bayaz"}]}, "Article No.: 25": {"references": ["Lorin W.

In this article, we look at the transition from studying CS with the visual Scratch environment in middle school to studying CS with a professional textual programming language (C&num; or Java) in secondary school. We found that the programming knowledge and experience of students who had learned Scratch greatly facilitated learning the more advanced material in secondary school: less time was needed to learn new topics, there were fewer learning difficulties, and they achieved higher cognitive levels of understanding of most concepts (although at the end of the teaching process, there were no significant differences in achievements compared to students who had not studied Scratch). Furthermore, there was increased enrollment in CS classes, and students were observed to display higher levels of motivation and self-efficacy.

To reduce cognitive overload, a phased approach was followed in introducing programming concepts and development environments, beginning with the visual programming environment Scratch and culminating with Java development for Android smartphones. Studio-based learning, a pedagogical approach long established in the fields of architecture and design education, was used as the basis for a collaborative social constructivist\u2014and constructionist\u2014approach to learning. Smartphones offered students the potential to develop applications for a context that is both immediate and clearly relevant to the ways in which they utilize and interact with technology.The research was carried out over three full academic years and included 53 student participants. An exploratory case study methodology was used to investigate the efficacy of the approach in helping to overcome the barriers faced by novice programmers. The findings indicate that the approach has merit. The students were motivated and engaged by the learning experience and were able to develop sophisticated applications that incorporated images, sound, arrays, and event handling. There is evidence that aspects of the studio-based learning approach, such as the scope that it gave students to innovate and the open feedback during student presentations, provided a learning environment that was motivating. Overall, the combination of smartphones, studio-based learning, and appropriate scaffolding offers an effective way to teach introductory programming courses.", "authors": [{"name": "susan reardon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658671763"}, {"name": "brendan tangney", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100168412"}], "title": "Smartphones, Studio-Based Learning, and Scaffolding: Helping Novices Learn to Program", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "202\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "12\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "312\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "ireland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "institute of art design and technology dun laoghaire ireland", "city": null, "Name": "susan reardon"}, {"country": "ireland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "trinity college dublin dublin ireland", "city": null, "Name": "brendan tangney"}]}, "Article No.: 26": {"references": ["A.

In this article, the effects of three factors\u2014choice of programming language, problem-solving training, and the use of formative assessment\u2014on learning to program were investigated. The study adopted an iterative methodological approach carried out across 4 consecutive years. To evaluate the effects of each factor (implemented as a single change in each iteration) on students\u2019 learning performance, the study used quantitative, objective metrics. The findings revealed that using a syntactically simple language (Python) instead of a more complex one (Java) facilitated students\u2019 learning of programming concepts. Moreover, teaching problem solving before programming yielded significant improvements in student performance. These two factors were found to have variable effects on the acquisition of basic programming concepts. Finally, it was observed that effective formative feedback in the context of introductory programming depends on multiple parameters. The article discusses the implications of these findings, identifies avenues for further research, and argues for the importance of studies in computer science education anchored on sound research methodologies to produce generalizable results.", "authors": [{"name": "theodora koulouri", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453653160"}, {"name": "stanislao lauria", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453657980"}, {"name": "robert d macredie", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100057154"}], "title": "Teaching Introductory Programming: A Quantitative Evaluation of Different Approaches", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "637\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "48\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "964\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "brunel university uxbridge", "affiliation_string": "brunel university uxbridge uk", "city": "london", "Name": "theodora koulouri"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "brunel university uxbridge", "affiliation_string": "brunel university uxbridge uk", "city": "london", "Name": "stanislao lauria"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "brunel university uxbridge", "affiliation_string": "brunel university uxbridge uk", "city": "london", "Name": "robert d macredie"}]}, "Article No.: 27": {"references": ["Valerie Barr , Chris Stephenson, Bringing computational thinking to K-12: what is Involved and what is the role of the computer science education community?, ACM Inroads, v.2 n.1, March 2011[doi>10.1145/1929887.1929905]\n", "Randal E.

In this course, students learn computing concepts and computational thinking by writing programs in MATLAB that compute with data, by performing meaningful analyses, and by writing about the results. The goal of the study reported here is to better understand the thought processes students use in such a data-driven approach.

The results contribute to the growing body of knowledge about how to define and measure CL among children by proposing a new concept, Game Computational Sophistication (GCS). We analyzed 231 games programmed by 325 11 and 12 year olds with a range of prior computer experience who attended a voluntary technology class during or after school. Findings suggest that students\u2019 games exhibited a range of GCS: programs composed of sequences of simple programming constructs; programs composed of programming constructs, some of which are used to implement higher-order patterns; and programs composed of game mechanics built from combinations of patterns \u201cglued\u201d together with simple programming constructs. We use case studies of students\u2019 games to illustrate how variation in the use and integration of programming constructs, patterns, and game mechanics can be used to demonstrate evidence of CL. The study contributes to an understanding of what CL looks like in middle school, how to assess it, and how game-programming activities might promote CL.", "authors": [{"name": "linda werner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100452269"}, {"name": "jill denner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310483664"}, {"name": "shannon campe", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310486994"}], "title": "Children Programming Games: A Strategy for Measuring Computational Learning", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "373\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "54\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "451\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Honduras", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california santa cruz ca", "city": "santa cruz", "Name": "linda werner"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "jill denner"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "shannon campe"}]}}, "date": {"month": "February", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Bertoni, G., Daemen, J., Peeters, M., and Assche, G.

As a result, there is also an increasing need for entry-level developers who are capable of designing and building practical solutions for systems with stringent security requirements. This calls for careful attention to algorithm choice and implementation method, as well as trade-offs between hardware and software implementations. This article describes motivation and efforts taken by three departments at Rochester Institute of Technology (Computer Engineering, Computer Science, and Software Engineering) that were focused on creating a multidisciplinary course that integrates the algorithmic, engineering, and practical aspects of security as exemplified by applied cryptography.

CSTutor creates an environment that seamlessly combines a user\u2019s sketched diagram and code. In each of these data structure modes, the user can naturally sketch a data structure on the canvas just as they would on a white board. CSTutor analyzes the user\u2019s diagrams in real time, and automatically generates code in a separate code view to reflect any changes the user has made. Additionally, the code can also be edited and any new code changes will animate the data structure drawn on the canvas. The connection between the data structure drawn on the canvas and the code implementation is intended to bridge the gap between the conceptual diagram of a data structure and the actual implementation. We also present the results of two semester-long studies using CSTutor in a CS1 course.

To understand students\u2019 learning, we analyzed the structure and functionality of their circuits and program code as well as their design approaches to making and debugging their e-textile creations and their views of computing. We also studied students\u2019 changing perceptions of computing. Our discussion addresses the need for and design of scaffolded challenges and the potential for using crafts materials and activities such as e-textiles for designing introductory courses that can broaden participation in computing.", "authors": [{"name": "yasmin b kafai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81385598953"}, {"name": "eunkyoung lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81554901856"}, {"name": "kristin searle", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490687561"}, {"name": "deborah fields", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81317488550"}, {"name": "eliot kaplan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81554523956"}, {"name": "debora lui", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81554593056"}], "title": "A Crafts-Oriented Approach to Computing in High School: Introducing Computational Concepts, Practices, and Perspectives with Electronic Textiles", "citations": [{"Name": "Majeed Kazemitabaar ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Leyla Norooz ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mona Leigh Guha ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jon E.

Although modest increases have been shown in enrollments in computer-related majors in the past 4 years, the prediction is that even in 3 to 4 years when these students graduate, there will be shortages of computer-related professionals for industry. The challenge on which this article focuses is attracting students to select an information technology (IT) field such as computer science, computer engineering, software engineering, or information systems as a major when many high schools do not offer a single computer course, and high school counselors, families, and friends do not provide students with accurate information about the field. The social cognitive career theory (SCCT) has been used extensively within counseling and career psychology as a method for understanding how individuals develop vocational interests, make occupational choices, and achieve success within their chosen field. In this article, the SCCT model identifies factors that specifically influence high school students to select a major in an IT-related discipline. These factors can then be used to develop new or enhance existing IT-related activities for high school students. Our work demonstrates that both interest and outcome expectations have a significant positive impact on choice to major. Interest also is found to mediate the effects of self-efficacy and outcome expectations on choice of major. Overall, the model predicts a good portion of variance in the ultimate outcome of whether or not an individual chooses to major in IT.", "authors": [{"name": "andy luse", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350583299"}, {"name": "julie a rursch", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81456639927"}, {"name": "doug jacobson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330492416"}], "title": "Utilizing Structural Equation Modeling and Social Cognitive Career Theory to Identify Factors in Choice of IT as a Major", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "123\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "216\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "oklahoma state university stillwater ok", "city": null, "Name": "andy luse"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "iowa state university ames ia", "city": null, "Name": "julie a rursch"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "iowa state university ames ia", "city": null, "Name": "doug jacobson"}]}, "Article No.: 18": {"references": ["ACM/IEEE-CS Interim Review Task Force. 2008.

To remedy this situation, there needs to be major improvement in the knowledge and application of software validation techniques. Although there are several software validation techniques, software testing continues to be one of the most widely used in industry. The high demand for software engineers in the next decade has resulted in more software engineering (SE) courses being offered in academic institutions. However, due to the number of topics to be covered in SE courses, little or no attention is given to software testing, resulting in students entering industry with little or no testing experience.We propose a minimally disruptive approach of integrating software testing into SE courses by providing students access to a collaborative learning environment containing learning materials on testing techniques and testing tools. In this article, we describe the learning environment and the studies conducted to measure the benefits accrued by students using the learning environment in the SE courses.", "authors": [{"name": "peter j clarke", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100390499"}, {"name": "debra davis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81498642100"}, {"name": "tariq m king", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81322498244"}, {"name": "jairo pava", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436602880"}, {"name": "edward l jones", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100555157"}], "title": "Integrating Testing into Software Engineering Courses Supported by a Collaborative Learning Environment", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "133\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "220\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "philippines", "university": "national university", "affiliation_string": "florida international university", "city": "manila", "Name": "peter j clarke"}, {"country": "philippines", "university": "national university", "affiliation_string": "florida international university", "city": "manila", "Name": "debra davis"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "north dakota state university", "city": null, "Name": "tariq m king"}, {"country": "philippines", "university": "national university", "affiliation_string": "florida international university", "city": "manila", "Name": "jairo pava"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "florida am university", "city": null, "Name": "edward l jones"}]}, "Article No.: 20": {"references": ["A.

The max-min composition may be suitable for multiple choice questions (MCQs), but it is not adequate for questions with a more complex structure, as in the OOP assessment.

In this article, I argue that the questions that we ask are shaped by internalized theoretical presuppositions about how the social and behavioral worlds operate. And although such presuppositions are essential in making the world sensible, at the same time they preclude carrying out many research studies that may further our collective research enterprise. I build this argument by first considering a few proposed research questions typical of much of the existing research in CS education, making visible the cognitivist assumptions that these questions presuppose. I then provide a different set of assumptions based on sociocultural theories of cognition and enumerate some of the (different) research questions to which these presuppositions give rise. My point is not to debate the merits of the contrasting theories but to demonstrate how theories about how minds and sociality operate are imminent in the very questions that researchers ask. Finally, I argue that by appropriating existing theory from the social, behavioral, and learning sciences, and making such theories explicit in carrying out and reporting their research, CS education researchers will advance the field.", "authors": [{"name": "josh tenenberg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100296642"}], "title": "Asking Research Questions: Theoretical Presuppositions", "citations": [{"Name": "Mihaela Sabin ", "Country": "lithuania", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "John Impagliazzo ", "Country": "lithuania", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hala Alrumaih ", "Country": "lithuania", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Brenda Byers ", "Country": "lithuania", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daina Gudoniene ", "Country": "lithuania", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Margaret Hamilton ", "Country": "lithuania", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Vsevolod Kotlyarov ", "Country": "lithuania", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Barry Lunt ", "Country": "lithuania", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "James W.

Many instructors intend that such projects create software applications for use by real-world customers. While it is important that the first version of these applications satisfy the customer by providing the functionality the customer expects and perform reliably and efficiently, it is equally important to be able to accommodate the customer's change requests over the period of the product's lifetime. The challenges in achieving these goals include the lack of real-world software development experience among the student developers and the fact that postdeployment change requests will almost certainly have to be handled by students who are not among the original developers. In this article, we describe how a model-centric approach using UML has been effective in enabling students to develop and maintain eight software applications for small businesses over a 9-year period. We discuss the characteristics of our modeling technique, which include the application of modeling patterns and quality check rules that enable students to create a model that can be clearly and consistently mapped to code. We also describe the nature of these mapping-to-code techniques, emphasizing how they reduce coupling among the implementation's classes. We then discuss our experiences in the classroom with these techniques, focusing on how we have improved our teaching over the years based on the analysis of student performance and feedback. Finally, we compare our approach to related work teaching modeling and the development and maintenance of code in software engineering courses with both extensive and minimal modeling.", "authors": [{"name": "sandeep mitra", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81327490406"}], "title": "Using UML Modeling to Facilitate Three-Tier Architecture Projects in Software Engineering Courses", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "96\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "151\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United Kingdom", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the college at brockport state university of new york brockport ny", "city": "york", "Name": "sandeep mitra"}]}, "Article No.: 21": {"references": ["Beth Adelson , Elliot Soloway, The Role of Domain Expenence in Software Design, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, v.11 n.11, p.1351-1360, November 1985[doi>10.1109/TSE.1985.231883]\n", "Giora Alexandron , Michal Armoni , Michal Gordon , David Harel, The effect of previous programming experience on the learning of scenario-based programming, Proceedings of the 12th Koli Calling International Conference on Computing Education Research, p.151-159, November 15-18, 2012, Koli, Finland[doi>10.1145/2401796.2401821]\n", "Giora Alexandron , Michal Armoni , Michal Gordon , David Harel, On teaching programming with nondeterminism, Proceedings of the 8th Workshop in Primary and Secondary Computing Education, p.71-74, November 11-13, 2013, Aarhus, Denmark[doi>10.1145/2532748.2532762]\n", "Giora Alexandron , Michal Armoni , Michal Gordon , David Harel, Scenario-based programming: reducing the cognitive load, fostering abstract thinking, Companion Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Software Engineering, May 31-June 07, 2014, Hyderabad, India[doi>10.1145/2591062.2591167]\n", "Michal Armoni. 2013.

Based on a qualitative analysis, we found that when working with the visual, interobject language of live sequence charts (LSC), programmers tend to adopt an external and usability-oriented view of the system, whereas when working with an intraobject language, they tend to adopt an internal and implementation-oriented viewpoint. This is explained by first discussing the possible effect of the programming paradigm on programmers\u2019 perception and then offering a more comprehensive explanation. The latter is based on a cognitive model of programming with LSC, which is an interpretation and a projection of the model suggested by Adelson and Soloway [1985] onto LSC and scenario-based programming, the new paradigm on which LSC is based. Our model suggests that LSC fosters a kind of programming that enables iterative refinement of the artifact with fewer entries into the solution domain. Thus, the programmer can make less context switching between the solution domain and the problem domain, and consequently spend more time in the latter. We believe that these findings are interesting mainly in two ways. First, they characterize an aspect of problem-solving behavior that to the best of our knowledge has not been studied before\u2014the programmer\u2019s perspective. The perspective can potentially affect the outcome of the problem-solving process, such as by leading the programmer to focus on different parts of the problem. Second, relating the structure of the language to the change in perspective sheds light on one of the ways in which the programming language can affect the programmer\u2019s behavior.", "authors": [{"name": "giora alexandron", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323487482"}, {"name": "michal armoni", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100644679"}, {"name": "michal gordon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418597109"}, {"name": "david harel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81508690943"}], "title": "Scenario-Based Programming, Usability-Oriented Perception", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "77\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "113\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "israel", "university": "weizmann institute of science", "affiliation_string": "weizmann institute of science rehovot israel", "city": "rehovot", "Name": "giora alexandron"}, {"country": "israel", "university": "weizmann institute of science", "affiliation_string": "weizmann institute of science rehovot israel", "city": "rehovot", "Name": "michal armoni"}, {"country": "israel", "university": "weizmann institute of science", "affiliation_string": "weizmann institute of science rehovot israel", "city": "rehovot", "Name": "michal gordon"}, {"country": "israel", "university": "weizmann institute of science", "affiliation_string": "weizmann institute of science rehovot israel", "city": "rehovot", "Name": "david harel"}]}}, "date": {"month": "November", "year": "2014"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 8": {"references": ["Armoni, M. and Gal-Ezer, J. 2005a.

These two countries differ profoundly in culture, language, government and state structure, and in their education systems. Despite these differences, however, they share the pursuit of excellence and high standards in K-12 education. In Israel, curriculum is determined at the national level. The high-school computer science curriculum has been in place for more than 20 years and is offered in all schools as an elective similar to biology, chemistry, and physics. The picture in the United States is more complex and therefore less amenable to generalization. Because educational policy is set at the state and sometimes even at the school district level, access to computer science courses and the content of those courses can vary even for schools within the same district. This article will describe the development of the curricula/standards in both countries and the current situation, focusing on common issues and challenges in areas such as equity and teacher training.", "authors": [{"name": "judith gal-ezer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100317682"}, {"name": "chris stephenson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100072566"}], "title": "A Tale of Two Countries: Successes and Challenges in K-12 Computer Science Education in Israel and the United States", "citations": [{"Name": "Carol Spradling ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Diana Linville ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michael P.

The changes were phased in from 2011 to 2013, and we review this process using the Darmstadt model, including describing the context of the school system, the socio-cultural factors in play before, during and after the changes, the nature of the new standards, the reactions and roles of the various stakeholders, and the teaching materials and methods that developed. The changes occurred very quickly, and we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of having such a rapid process. In all these changes, teachers have emerged as having a central role, as they have been key in instigating and implementing change.", "authors": [{"name": "tim bell", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81406597531"}, {"name": "peter andreae", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100187128"}, {"name": "anthony robins", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100599858"}], "title": "A Case Study of the Introduction of Computer Science in NZ Schools", "citations": [{"Name": "Tony Clear", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Everybody must cut code! educational imperative", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Peter Hubwieser ", "Country": "lithuania", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michail N.

The goal of this special issue is to offer a publication platform for soundly based in-depth experiences that have been made around the world with concepts, approaches, or initiatives that aim at supporting this shift. For this purpose, the article format was kept as large as possible, enabling the authors to explain many facets of their concepts and experiences in detail. Regarding the structure of the articles, we had encouraged the authors to lean on the Darmstadt Model, a category system that was developed to support the development, improvement, and investigation of K-12 CSE across regional or national boundaries. This model could serve as a unifying framework that might provide a proper structure for a well-founded critical discussion about the future of K-12 CSE. Curriculum designers or policy stakeholders, who have to decide, which approach an upcoming national initiative should follow, could benefit from this discussion as well as researchers who are investigating K12 CSE in any regard. With this goal in mind, we have selected six extensive and two short case studies from the UK, New Zealand, USA/Israel, France, Sweden, Georgia (USA), Russia, and Italy that provide an in-depth analysis of K-12 CSE in their respective country or state.", "authors": [{"name": "peter hubwieser", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100624459"}, {"name": "michal armoni", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100644679"}, {"name": "michail n giannakos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81470653047"}, {"name": "roland t mittermeir", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100578387"}], "title": "Perspectives and Visions of Computer Science Education in Primary and Secondary (K-12) Schools", "citations": [{"Name": "Peter Hubwieser ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michal Armoni ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michail N.

The study\u2019s design is inspired by the curriculum theory presented by Lindensj\u00f6 and Lundgren [2000], who suggest using the concept of arenas (the arenas of enactment, transformation and realisation) when discussing curriculum development. Data collection in this study comprises activities and actors in the arenas of enactment and transformation. Collected data include contemporary articles, journals, reports, booklets, government documents and archived documents. Findings show that informatics education in Sweden evolved from primarily focusing on programming knowledge related to automatic data processing and offered exclusively in vocational education (the 1960s and 1970s) to later (early 1980s) being introduced in the upper secondary school curriculum under the headingDatakunskap. The enactment of the informatics curriculum in 1983 encompassed programming, system development and computing in relation to applied sciences and civics. Mathematics teachers did much of the experimental work. It is shown that the competencies of upper secondary school teachers at the time rarely corresponded to the demands of the subject (content knowledge, resources and pedagogical skills). Stereotypical examples were therefore developed to support teachers in instructing about the subject content. When implemented in the theoretical natural science-programme, system development/systemisation was transformed into a twofold issue, comprising vocational attributes and societal aspects of computer programming. The implementation of today\u2019s informatics education, including programming in the curriculum, should draw from lessons learned from history. For a successful outcome, this study emphasises the necessity to understand 1) the common incentives for introducing computer programming in the curriculum, 2) the requirement for teachers\u2019 pedagogical content knowledge and 3) the stakeholders\u2019 role in the curriculum development process.", "authors": [{"name": "lennart rolandsson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82259124557"}, {"name": "inga-britt skogh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658614256"}], "title": "Programming in School: Look Back to Move Forward", "citations": [{"Name": "Antti-Jussi Lakanen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ville Isom\u00f6tt\u00f6nen", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Peter Hubwieser ", "Country": "lithuania", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michail N.

(GaComputes) was a six-year (2006--2012) project to improve computing education across the state of Georgia in the United States, funded by the National Science Foundation. The goal of GaComputes was to broaden participation in computing and especially to engage more members of underrepresented groups which includes women, African Americans, and Hispanics. GaComputes\u2019 interventions were multi-faceted and broad: summer camps and after-school/weekend programs for 4th--12th grade students, professional development for secondary teachers, and professional development for post-secondary instructors faculty. All of the efforts were carefully evaluated by an external team (led by the third and fourth authors), which provides us with an unusually detailed view into a computing education intervention across a region (about 59K square miles, about 9.9 million residents). Our dataset includes evaluations from over 2,000 students who attended after-school or weekend workshops, over 500 secondary school teachers who attended professional development, 120 post-secondary teachers who attended professional development, and over 2,000 students who attended a summer day (non-residential) camp. GaComputes evaluations provide insight into details of interventions and into influences on student motivation and learning. In this article, we describe the results of these evaluations and describe how GaComputes broadened participation in computing in Georgia through both direct interventions and indirect support of other projects.", "authors": [{"name": "mark guzdial", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100467156"}, {"name": "barbara ericson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100073230"}, {"name": "tom mcklin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81498644433"}, {"name": "shelly engelman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87259299957"}], "title": "Georgia Computes!

It is interesting to note that correspondence between requirements for the outcomes of learning Informatics in Russian school and the requirements of K-12 Computer Science Standards (USA) is quite satisfactory.

While the changes are not consistent across each of the four devolved nations of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), there are developments in each that are moving the subject to become mandatory for all pupils from age 5 onwards. In this article, we detail how computer science declined in the UK, and the developments that led to its revitalisation: a mixture of industry and interest group lobbying, with a particular focus on the value of the subject to all school pupils, not just those who would study it at degree level. This rapid growth in the subject is not without issues, however: there remain significant forthcoming challenges with its delivery, especially surrounding the issue of training sufficient numbers of teachers. We describe a national network of teaching excellence which is being set up to combat this problem, and look at the other challenges that lie ahead.", "authors": [{"name": "neil c c brown", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442604138"}, {"name": "sue sentance", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81493659866"}, {"name": "tom crick", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442615599"}, {"name": "simon humphreys", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81555031856"}], "title": "Restart: The Resurgence of Computer Science in UK Schools", "citations": [{"Name": "Elizabeth C.

This model brings faculty, students, and community partners together to investigate an open-ended academic question, and their collaboration yields an original product that represents their inquiry. The academic studio integrates agile software development practice, project-oriented pedagogy, and sociocultural cognition theories. Scrum provides the framework in which self-organizing, cross-functional teams define their methodology, and Scrum practices facilitate assessment of student learning outcomes.This model emerged from design-based research across six studio instances, each of which investigated the relationship of fun, games, and learning through the development of educational video games. Formal and informal analysis of these instances gives rise to several themes, including the importance of a formalized process to encourage learning and productivity, the critical role of an expert faculty mentor, the need to combine academic and industrial practice to manage the inherent challenges of collaborative software development, and the unique characteristics of learning outcomes arising from this model. We conclude that the academic studio model is beneficial to student learning and faculty development, and we encourage the adoption, adaptation, and evaluation of the model.", "authors": [{"name": "paul gestwicki", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100443377"}, {"name": "brian mcnely", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339516635"}], "title": "Interdisciplinary Projects in the Academic Studio", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "26\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "26\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "26\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "india", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ball state university muncie indiana", "city": null, "Name": "paul gestwicki"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of kentucky lexington ky", "city": "lexington", "Name": "brian mcnely"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Ball State University. 2014. 2013--14 Undergraduate Course Catalog.

In one CS course, students worked in teams to create a wiki solution to problem-based questions. Through a case-study approach, we test a developed teamwork framework, using manual content analysis and sentiment analysis, to determine if the framework can provide insight into students\u2019 teamwork behavior and to determine if the wiki task encouraged students to collaborate, share knowledge, and self-adopt teamwork roles. Analysis revealed the identification of both active and cohesive teams, disengaged students, and particular roles and behaviors that were lacking. Furthermore, sentiment analysis revealed that teams moved through positive and negative emotions over the course of developing their solution, toward satisfaction. The findings demonstrate the value of the detailed analysis of online teamwork. However, we propose the need for automated measures that provide real-time feedback to assist educators in the fair and efficient assessment of teamwork. We present a prototype system and recommendations, based on our analysis, for automated teamwork analysis tools.", "authors": [{"name": "rebecca vivian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81555337056"}, {"name": "katrina falkner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100603132"}, {"name": "nickolas falkner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81317493298"}, {"name": "hamid tarmazdi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658726779"}], "title": "A Method to Analyze Computer Science Students\u2019 Teamwork in Online Collaborative Learning Environments", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "57\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "57\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "57\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "australia", "university": "university of adelaide", "affiliation_string": "the university of adelaide south australia australia", "city": "adelaide", "Name": "rebecca vivian"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "university of adelaide", "affiliation_string": "the university of adelaide south australia australia", "city": "adelaide", "Name": "katrina falkner"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "university of adelaide", "affiliation_string": "the university of adelaide south australia australia", "city": "adelaide", "Name": "nickolas falkner"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "university of adelaide", "affiliation_string": "the university of adelaide south australia australia", "city": "adelaide", "Name": "hamid tarmazdi"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["ABET. 2015.

It is therefore important for graduates to have experienced teamwork before they enter the job market.We describe an experiential learning exercise that we designed to teach the software engineering process in conjunction with teamwork skills. The underlying teaching strategy applied in the exercise maximises risks in order to provide maximal experiential learning opportunities. The students are expected to work in fairly large, yet short-lived, instructor-assigned teams to complete software engineering tasks. After undergoing the exercise our students form self-selected teams for their capstone projects. In this article, we determine and report on the influence the teaching exercise had on the formation of teams for the capstone project. By analysing data provided by the students through regular peer reviews we gain insight into the team dynamics as well as to what extent the members contributed to the team effort.We develop and present a graphical model of a capstone project team which highlights participation of individuals during the teaching exercise. The participatory history of the members is visualised using segmented concentric rings. We consider how this visualisation can aid the identification of capstone project teams that are at risk. In our experience the composition of the team and the behaviour of other members in the team may have a marked impact on the behaviour of each individual in the team. We established a team classification in order to model information about teams. We use a statistical clustering method to classify teams. For this we use team profiles that are based on the participatory levels of its members. The team types that emerge from the clustering are used to derive migration models. When we consider migration, we build spring models to visualise the teams through which individuals migrate. We colour code the teams to characterise them according to the team types that were identified during the cluster classification of the teams. Owing to the complexity of the resulting model, only migrations for capstone team members who have worked together during the exercise or for solitary capstone team members are modelled. These models support the identification of areas of interest that warrant further investigation.To conclude, we present our observations from the analysis of team compositions, team types, and team migrations and provide directions for future work and collaborations.", "authors": [{"name": "linda marshall", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100280573"}, {"name": "vreda pieterse", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100481696"}, {"name": "lisa thompson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81498640840"}, {"name": "dina m venter", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81498659231"}], "title": "Exploration of Participation in Student Software Engineering Teams", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "56\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "56\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "56\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "south africa", "university": "university of pretoria", "affiliation_string": "university of pretoria pretoria south africa", "city": "pretoria", "Name": "linda marshall"}, {"country": "south africa", "university": "university of pretoria", "affiliation_string": "university of pretoria pretoria south africa", "city": "pretoria", "Name": "vreda pieterse"}, {"country": "south africa", "university": "university of pretoria", "affiliation_string": "university of pretoria pretoria", "city": "pretoria", "Name": "lisa thompson"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2016"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Algebra End-of-Course Assessment. 2009.

A better understanding of why some students choose to learn on their own may help us to motivate other students to develop this important skill. In addition, it may help in curriculum design; if we need to leave some topics out of our expanding curriculum, a good choice might be those topics that students readily learn on their own.Based on a thematic analysis of 17 semistructured interviews, we found that computing students\u2019 motivations for self-directed learning fall into four general themes: projects, social and peer interactions, joy of learning, and fear. Under these, we describe several more specific subthemes, illustrated in the words of the students.The project-related and social motivations are quite prominent. Although these motivations appear in the literature, they received greater emphasis from our interviewees. Perhaps most characteristic of computing is the motivation to learn to complete some project, both projects done for fun and projects required for school or work.", "authors": [{"name": "robert mccartney", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100566786"}, {"name": "jonas boustedt", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81324487873"}, {"name": "anna eckerdal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81324489254"}, {"name": "kate sanders", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81410591814"}, {"name": "lynda thomas", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81337494150"}, {"name": "carol zander", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100615737"}], "title": "Why Computing Students Learn on Their Own: Motivation for Self-Directed Learning of Computing", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "213\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "65\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "213\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of connecticut ct usa", "city": null, "Name": "robert mccartney"}, {"country": "Sweden", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of gavle gavle sweden", "city": "gavle", "Name": "jonas boustedt"}, {"country": "sweden", "university": "uppsala university", "affiliation_string": "uppsala university uppsala sweden", "city": "uppsala", "Name": "anna eckerdal"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "rhode island college ri usa", "city": null, "Name": "kate sanders"}, {"country": "United Kingdom", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "aberystwyth university wales uk", "city": "wales", "Name": "lynda thomas"}, {"country": "Ghana", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of washington bothell wa usa", "city": "wa", "Name": "carol zander"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["K.

Finally, the two groups debate their points of view in front of the class (in traditional courses) or in a chat room (in distance education courses). Debate and competition between the groups provide a chance for the students to learn more about each other's work. They also gain an opportunity to learn how to give and receive criticisms in a constructive way.

In this paper we review the tools and resources available to students and report our experiences in having students to work on this project in a course at the University of Arizona. We also review two tools, called AI Spider and AI Indexer, we developed for students in this project.

This paper presents an approach to teaching software testing in a way that will encourage students to practice testing skills in many classes and give them concrete feedback on their testing performance, without requiring a new course, any new faculty resources, or a significant number of lecture hours in each course where testing will be practiced. The strategy is to give students basic exposure to test-driven development, and then provide an automated tool that will assess student submissions on-demand and provide feedback for improvement. This approach has been demonstrated in an undergraduate programming languages course using a prototype tool. The results have been positive, with students expressing appreciation for the practical benefits of test-driven development on programming assignments. Experimental analysis of student programs shows a 28% reduction in defects per thousand lines of code.", "authors": [{"name": "stephen h edwards", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100595678"}], "title": "Improving student performance by evaluating how well students test their own programs", "citations": [{"Name": "Stephen H.

The graphical environment for MarieSim and the accompanying data path simulator are written in Java Swing; the integrated MARIE assembler is written in Java. The software has proven useful in introductory computer organization and architecture classes. Students find MarieSim very easy to use, and anecdotal results indicate increased architectural understanding.

Yet \u201cliberal arts\u201d can denote a philosophy of education that emphasizes broadly preparing students for all aspects of their future lives, and as computing becomes more central to the ways in which we think about the world, computer science becomes correspondingly more central in such an education. This, in turn, makes computer science more important in the programs of educational institutions that follow a liberal arts philosophy. This issue ofTransactions on Computing Educationpresents three articles that examine the intersection of computer science and the liberal arts. Walker and Kelemen explore in detail how a liberal arts philosophy complements the needs of computer science education, and how computer science as a discipline fits the goals of a liberal arts philosophy. Bruce et al. present the history of a consortium of computer scientists from liberal arts colleges and the model computer science curricula they have developed for such colleges. Finally, Baldwin et al. describe the concrete computer science programs at five institutions, each with a distinct place in the liberal arts spectrum.

Our work, funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation, involves the development, implementation, and testing of a suite of projects that can be closely integrated into a one-term AI course. Each project involves the development of a machine learning system in a specific application. These projects have been used in six different offerings over a three-year period at three different types of institutions. While we have presented a sample of the projects as well as limited preliminary experiences in other venues, this article presents the first assessment of our work over an extended period of three years. Results of assessment show that the projects were well received by the students. By using projects involving real-world applications we provided additional motivation for students. While illustrating core concepts, the projects introduced students to an important area in computer science, machine learning, thus motivating further study.", "authors": [{"name": "ingrid russell", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100588570"}, {"name": "zdravko markov", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100187159"}, {"name": "todd neller", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100430979"}, {"name": "susan coleman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100290332"}], "title": "MLeXAI: A Project-Based Application-Oriented Model", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "27\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "299\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of hartford", "city": null, "Name": "ingrid russell"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "central connecticut state university", "city": null, "Name": "zdravko markov"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "gettysburg college", "city": null, "Name": "todd neller"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of hartford", "city": null, "Name": "susan coleman"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Adams, R.

It can provide a better understanding of the human aspects in computer programming process and can also contribute to the computer programming education in general. The study identified the presence of a set of 42 CPs in computer programming (C language). The study used Verbal Protocol Analysis (VPA) in identifying these CPs. It is a qualitative study on the Verbal Protocols (VPs) of 19 students. Some of the CPs have been inferred by referring to the literature and some have been additionally identified by this study. The additional CPs found are confusion, hypothesis, interrogation, iteration, monitoring, recollection, recurrence, and translation. It is observed that programming involves the interplay of lower and higher CPs and needs various cognitive skills, which increase the processing load on the brain and make the programming process difficult and complex to learn and practice. The same set of CPs was found in both the effective and ineffective subjects. The research results can provide deeper knowledge to teachers on cognitive aspects of programming and the cognitive behavior of students during the programming process.", "authors": [{"name": "vg renumol", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81467668346"}, {"name": "dharanipragada janakiram", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81467664666"}, {"name": "s jayaprakash", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87658930057"}], "title": "Identification of Cognitive Processes of Effective and Ineffective Students During Computer Programming", "citations": [{"Name": "Theodora Koulouri ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Stanislao Lauria ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Robert D.

We examine how AVs are distributed among topics, who created them and when, their overall quality, and how they are disseminated. There does exist a cadre of good AVs and active developers. Unfortunately, we found that many AVs are of low quality, and coverage is skewed toward a few easier topics. This can make it hard for instructors to locate what they need. There are no effective repositories of AVs currently available, which puts many AVs at risk for being lost to the community over time. Thus, the field appears in need of improvement in disseminating materials, propagating known best practices, and informing developers about topic coverage. These concerns could be mitigated by building community and improving communication among AV users and developers.", "authors": [{"name": "clifford a shaffer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452610921"}, {"name": "matthew l cooper", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81406596902"}, {"name": "alexander joel d alon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81467655760"}, {"name": "monika akbar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384612788"}, {"name": "michael stewart", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81484659568"}, {"name": "sean ponce", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81440594547"}, {"name": "stephen h edwards", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100595678"}], "title": "Algorithm Visualization: The State of the Field", "citations": [{"Name": "Essi Isohanni ", "Country": "finland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hannu-Matti J\u00e4rvinen", "Country": "finland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sebastian K\u00fcrten ", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wolfgang Mulzer", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Heather Logas ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Richard Vallejos ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Joseph Osborn ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kate Compton ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jim Whitehead", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Clifford A.

Teaching this field to computer science students demands special attention due to limited student experience in electronics and digital system design. This article presents a compact course on reconfigurable processors, which was offered at the Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, and is intended for instructors aiming to introduce a new course in reconfigurable computing. Therefore, a detailed description of the course structure and content is provided. In contrast to courses on digital system design, which use FPGAs as a case platform, our course places this platform at the center of its focus and highlights its features as a basis for reconfigurable computing. Both declarative knowledge and functioning knowledge are considered in defining learning outcomes based on a novel What-Why-How Model. Lab activities were designated to deepen the functioning knowledge. The written exam is aligned to learning outcomes and shows that most students acquired the intended outcomes.", "authors": [{"name": "abdulhadi shoufan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330498156"}, {"name": "sorin a huss", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100518695"}], "title": "A Course on Reconfigurable Processors", "citations": [{"Name": "Khaled Benkrid ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Thomas Clayton", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "15\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "307\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "germany", "university": "technische universitat darmstadt", "affiliation_string": "technische universitat darmstadt", "city": "darmstadt", "Name": "abdulhadi shoufan"}, {"country": "germany", "university": "technische universitat darmstadt", "affiliation_string": "technische universitat darmstadt", "city": "darmstadt", "Name": "sorin a huss"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Allen, M.

This article describes the evolution and results of collaborations among three courses: an undergraduate CS course about user interface design and implementation, an undergraduate Scientific and Technical Communication (STC) course about usability and instructions writing, and a graduate CS/Human Factors course about user-interface evaluation and usability testing. Students from all three courses work with scientists to complete the scientist-sponsored citizen science Android applications (apps). Students from the undergraduate CS and STC courses form multidisciplinary teams to design and implement apps, while the graduate students consult with the teams by evaluating and user-testing the apps. The collaboration's effectiveness was assessed using student surveys, interviews, and evaluations of student work. This article compares the collaboration within the teams and the coordination with the scientists across two years of activities in order to determine the effectiveness of course modifications. The article concludes with recommendations for improving the collaboration within teams and the coordination with clients in multidisciplinary course projects.", "authors": [{"name": "robert pastel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100418874"}, {"name": "marika seigel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81342510697"}, {"name": "wei zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658768708"}, {"name": "alex mayer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81479643460"}], "title": "Team Building in Multidisciplinary Client-Sponsored Project Courses", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "70\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "25\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "70\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "michigan technological university houghton mi", "city": null, "Name": "robert pastel"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "michigan technological university houghton mi", "city": null, "Name": "marika seigel"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "michigan technological university houghton mi", "city": null, "Name": "wei zhang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "michigan technological university houghton mi", "city": null, "Name": "alex mayer"}]}, "Article No.: 18": {"references": ["Liisa Auer , Jouni Juntunen , Pekka Ojala, Open source project as a pedagogical tool in higher education, Proceedings of the 15th International Academic MindTrek Conference: Envisioning Future Media Environments, September 28-30, 2011, Tampere, Finland[doi>10.1145/2181037.2181073]\n", "Sylvia Beyer, Kristina Rynes, and Susan Haller. 2004.

Involving student teams in real-world projects developed by professional software engineers for actual users is invaluable. Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) has emerged as an important approach to creating, managing, and distributing software products. Involvement in a FOSS project provides students with experience developing within a professional environment, with a professional community, and has the additional benefit that all communication and artifacts are publicly accessible. Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS) projects benefit the human condition in some manner. They can range from disaster management to microfinance to election-monitoring applications. This article discusses the benefits and challenges of students participating in HFOSS projects within the context of undergraduate computing degree programs. This article reports on a 6-year study of students' self-reported attitudes and learning from participation in an HFOSS project. Results indicate that working on an HFOSS project increases interest in computing. In addition, students perceive that they are gaining experience in developing software in a distributed environment with the attendant skills of communication, distributed teamwork, and more.", "authors": [{"name": "heidi j c ellis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81430607542"}, {"name": "gregory w hislop", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100097654"}, {"name": "stoney jackson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100096016"}, {"name": "lori postner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81311480764"}], "title": "Team Project Experiences in Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS)", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "71\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "17\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "71\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "heidi j c ellis"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "gregory w hislopdrexel university philadelphia pa"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "stoney jackson"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "nassau community college garden city ny", "city": null, "Name": "lori postner"}]}, "Article No.: 20": {"references": ["Adelina Basholli , Fesal Baxhaku , Dimitris Dranidis , Thanos Hatziapostolou, Fair assessment in software engineering capstone projects, Proceedings of the 6th Balkan Conference in Informatics, September 19-21, 2013, Thessaloniki, Greece[doi>10.1145/2490257.2490268]\n", "John Biggs. 1996.

Assessing such projects is, however, extremely challenging. There are various aspects and trade-offs of assessments that can affect course quality. Individual assessments may fairly grade individuals, but may lose focus of the project as a group activity. Extensive teacher involvement is necessary for objective assessment, but may affect the way that students work. Continuous feedback to students can enhance learning, but may be hard to combine with fair assessment. Most previous work focuses on some specific assessment aspect; in this article, we present an assessment model that consists of a collection of assessment activities, each covering different aspects. We have applied, developed, and improved these activities during a 7yr period. To evaluate the usefulness of the model, we perform questionnaire-based surveys over a 2yr period. Furthermore, we design and execute an experiment that studies to what extent students can perform fair peer assessment and to what degree the assessments of students and teachers agree. We analyze the results, discuss findings, and summarize lessons learned.", "authors": [{"name": "maria vasilevskaya", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81496688895"}, {"name": "david broman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436594060"}, {"name": "kristian sandahl", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100635362"}], "title": "Assessing Large-Project Courses: Model, Activities, and Lessons Learned", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "85\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "34\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "85\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "sweden", "university": "linkoping university", "affiliation_string": "linkoping university sweden", "city": "linkoping", "Name": "maria vasilevskaya"}, {"country": "Trinidad and Tobago", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "kth royal institute of technology and university of california berkeley california", "city": "california", "Name": "david broman"}, {"country": "sweden", "university": "linkoping university", "affiliation_string": "linkoping university sweden", "city": "linkoping", "Name": "kristian sandahl"}]}, "Article No.: 16": {"references": ["ABET. 2015.

The design space for such courses is wide, ranging from single-semester to two-semester courses, from single-client to multicustomer courses, from local to globally distributed courses, and from toy projects to projects with real clients. The challenge for a nontrivial project course is how to make the project complex enough to enrich students\u2019 software engineering experience, yet realistic enough to have a teaching environment that does not unduly burden students or the instructor. We describe a methodology for project courses that is realizable for instructors, improves students\u2019 skills, and leads to viable results for industry partners.In particular, recent advances in release management and collaboration workflows reduce the effort of students and instructors during delivery and increase the quality of the deliverables. To enable release and feedback management, we introduce Rugby, an agile process model based on Scrum that allows reacting to changing requirements. To improve early communication, we use Tornado, a scenario-based design approach that emphasizes the use of informal models for the interaction between clients and students. The combination of Rugby and Tornado allows students to deal with changing requirements, produce multiple releases, and obtain client feedback through the duration of the course.We describe our experience with more than 300 students working on 40 projects with external clients over a 4-year period. In the latest instance of our course, the students have produced more than 7000 builds with 600 releases for eleven clients. In an evaluation of the courses, we found that the introduction of Rugby and Tornado significantly increased students\u2019 technical skills, especially with respect to software engineering, usability engineering, and configuration management, as well as their nontechnical skills such as communication with the client, teamwork, presentation, and demo management. Finally, we discuss how other instructors can adapt the course concept.", "authors": [{"name": "bernd bruegge", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100313351"}, {"name": "stephan krusche", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490692552"}, {"name": "lukas alperowitz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=88158610057"}], "title": "Software Engineering Project Courses with Industrial Clients", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "207\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "51\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "207\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "germany", "university": "technische universitat munchen", "affiliation_string": "technische universitat munchen garching germany", "city": "munich", "Name": "bernd bruegge"}, {"country": "germany", "university": "technische universitat munchen", "affiliation_string": "technische universitat munchen garching germany", "city": "munich", "Name": "stephan krusche"}, {"country": "germany", "university": "technische universitat munchen", "affiliation_string": "technische universitat munchen garching germany", "city": "munich", "Name": "lukas alperowitz"}]}, "Article No.: 21": {"references": ["Ulrike Abelein and Barbara Paech. 2014.

Team projects are an essential part of the software engineering curriculum. Student teams carry out full software projects, including requirements elicitation, project management, implementation, and testing. This requires various technical skills, but non-technical and psychological aspects are of utmost importance as well, just as in professional software teams. Modern software is often developed by distributed teams. In many cases, team members feel isolated and distant from each other. Indirect communication and inappropriate media create a similar feeling of distance as geographical location. This perceived distance could have an impact on their individual and group moods, and eventually on project success. Therefore, these factors should be considered in educational software engineering team projects.In a longitudinal study at Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, 20 student teams were observed over a period of 4 months. They were free to schedule team meetings when and where they wanted; and they could use any communication media they chose. Statistical correlations and non-parametric test are used for quantitative empirical analysis. Furthermore, we used analyses of variance for repeated measures to investigate conflicts over time. Results led to a number of recommendations for course organizers. They are interesting for software engineering in general.", "authors": [{"name": "kurt schneider", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100155742"}, {"name": "olga liskin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81484655873"}, {"name": "hilko paulsen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658771577"}, {"name": "simone kauffeld", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658735815"}], "title": "Media, Mood, and Meetings: Related to Project Success?", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "66\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "33\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "66\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "germany", "university": "universitat hannover", "affiliation_string": "leibniz universitat hannover hannover germany", "city": "hanover", "Name": "kurt schneider"}, {"country": "germany", "university": "universitat hannover", "affiliation_string": "leibniz universitat hannover hannover germany", "city": "hanover", "Name": "olga liskin"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "technical university braunschweig", "city": null, "Name": "hilko paulsen"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "technical university braunschweig", "city": null, "Name": "simone kauffeld"}]}}, "date": {"month": "December", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["H.

However, it is generally considered difficult to learn among students. In this study, we examined factors that could influence students' perceptions of accomplishment and enjoyment and their intention to learn in the web development course. Specifically, we investigated both student-related and instructor-related factors. A research model was developed. To empirically test the model and the hypotheses, the survey method was used and the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was adopted for data analysis. Overall, the results indicated that both student-related factors (perceived web development efficacy and motivation) and instructor-related factors (instructor characteristics and teaching method) could significantly influence students' perceptions toward accomplishment and enjoyment and their intention to learn web development. We also summarized comments collected from students to gain a deeper understanding of their ideas toward learning web development techniques.

In this article, we describe a study of undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory web development course taken by both computing majors and general education students. Using data collected during the initial weeks of the course, we investigate the nature of the syntax errors they make when learning HTML and CSS, and how they resolve them. This is accomplished through the deployment of openHTML, a lightweight web-based code editor that logs user activity. Our analysis reveals that nearly all students made syntax errors that remained unresolved in their assessments, and that these errors continued weeks into the course. Approximately 20&percnt; of these errors related to the relatively complex system of rules that dictateswhenit is valid for HTML elements to be nested in one another. On the other hand, 35&percnt; of errors related to the relatively simple tag syntax determininghowHTML elements are nested. We also find that validation played a key role in resolving errors: While the majority of unresolved errors were present in untested code, nearly all of the errors that were detected through validation were eventually corrected.

Moreover, many faculty members often struggle with knowing \u201chow much\u201d of a particular subject they should teach to their students and at what level. This small-scale, exploratory study seeks to uncover the existence of \u201cthreshold concepts\u201d within Web development. Threshold concepts are the fundamental concepts which, once mastered, allow a learner to progress to a deeper understanding of a subject. An online questionnaire was sent out to 24 instructors within UK higher education institutions who teach Web development subjects. Nine participants responded to the questionnaire and interviews were conducted with five to discuss and expand on the responses provided, resulting in the identification of four areas that were perceived as difficult for students to grasp when learning Web development. Analysis of these areas suggests that threshold concepts do exist within the subject and we offer up two candidates for the field of Web development:basic programming principles and decomposition and abstraction. Designing a curriculum based on threshold concepts and less on the latest methods, tools, and techniques can go a long way in helping students to become experts in their chosen discipline.", "authors": [{"name": "peter alston", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81486648809"}, {"name": "david walsh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658689482"}, {"name": "gary westhead", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658691469"}], "title": "Uncovering \u201cThreshold Concepts\u201d in Web Development: An Instructor Perspective", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "124\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "165\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of liverpool", "affiliation_string": "university of liverpool uk", "city": "liverpool", "Name": "peter alston"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "david walsh"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "gary westhead"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 15": {"references": ["ABET. 2014.

To accomplish this central educational objective, this article describes a systematic process of introducing reasoning skills into the curriculum and assessing how well students have learned those skills. To facilitate assessment, a comprehensive inventory of principles for reasoning about correctness that captures the finer details of basic skills that students need to learn has been defined and used. The principles can be taught at various levels of depth across the curriculum in a variety of courses.The use of a particular instructional process is illustrated to inculcate reasoning principles across several iterations of a sophomore-level development foundations course and a junior-level software engineering course. The article summarizes how learning outcomes motivated by the inventory of reasoning principles lead to questions that in turn form the basis for a careful analysis of student understanding and for fine-tuning teaching interventions that together facilitate continuous improvements to instruction.", "authors": [{"name": "svetlana v drachova", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81503678477"}, {"name": "jason o hallstrom", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100345032"}, {"name": "joseph e hollingsworth", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100506555"}, {"name": "joan krone", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339510733"}, {"name": "rich pak", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100244606"}, {"name": "murali sitaraman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367590896"}], "title": "Teaching Mathematical Reasoning Principles for Software Correctness and Its Assessment", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "135\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "38\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "135\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "svetlana v drachova"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "jason o hallstromclemson university"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "joseph e hollingsworthindiana university southeast new albany in"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "joan kronedenison university granville oh"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "rich pakclemson university clemson sc"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "murali sitaraman", "city": null, "Name": "murali sitaramanclemson university clemson sc"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["L.

Efforts to understand this phenomenon have considered a wide range of predictors of CS success, such as prior programming experience, math ability, learning style, and gender, with findings that are suggestive but inconclusive. The current quasiexperimental study extends this research by exploring how the pedagogical approach of the course (traditional lecture vs. Peer Instruction (PI) and clickers) in combination with student achievement goals (mastery goals vs. performance goals) relates to exam grades, interest in the subject matter, and course enjoyment. The research revealed that students with performance goals scored significantly lower on final exams in both the lecture and PI conditions. However, students with performance goals reported higher levels of subject matter interest when taught through PI. Students with mastery goals, in both conditions, scored significantly higher on the final exam, had higher levels of interest, and reported higher levels of course enjoyment than their performance-oriented counterparts. The results suggest that PI may improve the level of subject-matter interest for some students, thereby indicating the importance of studying pedagogical approach as we seek to understand student outcomes in CS1.", "authors": [{"name": "daniel zingaro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81387609245"}], "title": "Examining Interest and Grades in Computer Science 1: A Study of Pedagogy and Achievement Goals", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "181\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "13\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "181\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "canada", "university": "university of toronto", "affiliation_string": "university of toronto mississauga mathematical and computational science mississauga on ca", "city": "toronto", "Name": "daniel zingaro"}]}, "Article No.: 12": {"references": ["Association for Computing Machinery.

We focus on the process by which we determined what constitutes publishability for a manuscript submitted to TOCE, describing what is best understood as a living process negotiated among the authors, reviewers, associate editors, and editors-in-chief in interaction with manuscripts and one another. Second, having reviewed a bit of history, we look at some possible changes in TOCE's future, particularly in light of conversations that the ACM is engaged in at all levels regarding recent open publishing initiatives as well as the relationship between journal and conference publications.

However, learning OOP is a cognitively demanding task for undergraduate students. Several difficulties and misconceptions have been recorded in the literature for both OOP concepts and languages, mainly Java. This article focuses on reviewing and advancing research on the most fundamental OOP concepts, namely, the concepts of \u201cobject\u201d and \u201cclass\u201d and their role during program execution. The results of a long-term investigation on the subject are presented, focusing on a study exploring undergraduate students\u2019 conceptions on \u201cobjects\u201d and \u201cclasses.\u201d The study advances related research on categories of conceptions on \u201cobjects\u201d and \u201cclasses\u201d by providing quantitative results, in addition to qualitative results, regarding the frequency of the recorded conceptions. Nearly half the students seem to comprehend the modeling and static&sol;dynamic aspects of the concepts \u201cobject\u201d and \u201cclass.\u201d Implications for achieving a deep conceptual understanding of text, action, and modeling aspects of these fundamental concepts are also discussed. Information regarding the programming environments utilized in the course and key features of the applied teaching approach are presented, in order to facilitate both a better understanding of the context and a better employment of the results of the presented study.

Starting as a vocational program, the content of computer education for students evolved to include content on computer literacy, Information Communication Technology (ICT) literacy, and brand-new computer science. While a new curriculum related to computer science was established in 2007, the range of computer education being provided in Korean schools has been repeatedly reduced. To identify the cause of this recent phenomenon, we review the computer education environment using the Darmstadt model, including educational systems, curricula, and teaching environments. Then we examine what factors affected the decline of computer education. The major causes of failure are found to be the absence of policy and a comprehensive evaluation method. These causes have led to a reduction in the selection ratio of computer-related subjects and in the number of students taking computer classes. Based on this understanding, we bring some fundamental message for establishing robust computer science education.", "authors": [{"name": "jeongwon choi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658712409"}, {"name": "sangjin an", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658711071"}, {"name": "youngjun lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436596410"}], "title": "Computing Education in Korea\u2014Current Issues and Endeavors", "citations": [{"Name": "Peter Hubwieser ", "Country": "lithuania", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michail N.

To alleviate the problem that school students are not able to study CS-related topics, the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki prepared a completely online course that is open to pupils and students in all schools in Finland. The course is a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), as the attendance scales without an upper bound. Schools in Finland have offered the MOOC as an elective CS course for their students and granted formal school credits for completing (parts of) it. Since our MOOC is exactly the same programming course as our university-level CS1 course, we are able to use the MOOC also as a long-lasting entrance exam to the CS BSc and MSc degrees. After two spring semesters of operation, we have observed that there are school students dispersed around Finland who are ready and willing to take on a challenging programming course online, and bridging the MOOC to a full study right makes a strong incentive to keep working on the programming assignments, even without traditional teaching.", "authors": [{"name": "jaakko kurhila", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409594869"}, {"name": "arto vihavainen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351608577"}], "title": "A Purposeful MOOC to Alleviate Insufficient CS Education in Finnish Schools", "citations": [{"Name": "Peter Hubwieser ", "Country": "lithuania", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michail N.

Though there have been efforts to create core curriculum standards for subjects like Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Math, CS seems to have been kept outside the purview of such efforts leading to its marginalization. As a first step, using the Darmstadt model from the ITiCSE working group that provides a systematic categorization approach to CS education in schools, we coded and analyzed the CS situation for the Indian schools. Next, we focused on the motivation category of the Darmstadt model and investigated behavioral intentions of secondary school students and teachers from 332 schools in India. Considering the CS subject as an educational innovation, using Rogers\u2019 Theory of Diffusion of Innovations, we propose a pedagogical framework for innovation attributes that can significantly predict-adoption of the CS subject among potential-adopter students and teachers. Data was analyzed to answer research questions about student and teacher intentions, influence of gender, school management, and school location in adopting CS. Interestingly, girls, urban students, teachers, and private schools were seen favoring the adoption of CS. An important issue that needed to be addressed, however, was the interchangeable use of terms like CS, Informatics, ICT, and digital literacy. Through our article, we offer a promising picture of the educational policy directives and the academic environment in India that is rapidly growing and embracing CS as a core subject of study in schools. We also analyze the factors that influence the adoption of CS by school students and teachers and conclude that there is a very positive response for CS among educators and students in India.", "authors": [{"name": "raghu raman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81492653565"}, {"name": "smrithi venkatasubramanian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658712587"}, {"name": "krishnashree achuthan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81461648293"}, {"name": "prema nedungadi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81461658413"}], "title": "Computer Science (CS) Education in Indian Schools: Situation Analysis using Darmstadt Model", "citations": [{"Name": "Peter Hubwieser ", "Country": "lithuania", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michail N.

Our intention was to collect a set of case studies from different countries that would describe all relevant aspects of specific implementations of Computer Science Education in K-12 schools. By this, we want to deliver well-founded arguments and rich material to the critical discussion about the state and the goals of K-12 computer science education, and also provide visions for the future of this research area. In this editorial, we explain our intention and report some details about the genesis of these special issues. Following, we give a short summary of the Darmstadt Model, which was suggested to serve as a structuring principle of the case studies. The next part of the editorial presents a short description of the five extended case studies from India, Korea, NRW&sol;Germany, Finland, and USA that are selected to be included in this second issue. In order to give some perspectives for the future, we propose a set of open research questions of the field, partly derived from the Darmstadt Model, partly stimulated by a look on large-scale investigations like PISA.", "authors": [{"name": "peter hubwieser", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100624459"}, {"name": "michal armoni", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100644679"}, {"name": "michail n giannakos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81470653047"}], "title": "How to Implement Rigorous Computer Science Education in K-12 Schools?

School systems will need to give increased attention to opportunities for students to engage in computational thinking and ways to promote a deeper understanding of how technologies and software are used as design tools. However, K-12 students in the United States are facing a broken pipeline for CS education. In response to this problem, we have developed the Scalable Game Design curriculum based on a strategy to integrate CS education into the regular school curriculum. This strategy includes opportunities for students to design and program games and science technology engineering and mathematics simulations. An approach called Computational Thinking Pattern Analysis has been developed to measure and correlate computational thinking skills relevant to game design and simulations. Results from a study with more than 10,000 students demonstrate rapid adoption of this curriculum by teachers from multiple disciplines, high student motivation, high levels of participation by women, and interest regardless of demographic background.", "authors": [{"name": "alexander repenning", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100362827"}, {"name": "david c webb", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435594612"}, {"name": "kyu han koh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81421602009"}, {"name": "hilarie nickerson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81554965056"}, {"name": "susan b miller", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658712651"}, {"name": "catharine brand", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339490999"}, {"name": "ian her many horses", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658710697"}, {"name": "ashok basawapatna", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81421602494"}, {"name": "fred gluck", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658713531"}, {"name": "ryan grover", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658711003"}, {"name": "kris gutierrez", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658710432"}, {"name": "nadia repenning", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81488641112"}], "title": "Scalable Game Design: A Strategy to Bring Systemic Computer Science Education to Schools through Game Design and Simulation Creation", "citations": [{"Name": "Peter Hubwieser ", "Country": "lithuania", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michail N.

In particular, we focus on the differential school system and the educational landscape of CS education, the different facets of CS teacher education, and CS education research programs and directions that are directly connected with these aspects. In addition, this report offers a rationale for including CS education in general education, which includes the educational value of CS for students in today\u2019s information and knowledge society. Through this article, we ultimately provide an overview of the significant elements that are crucial for the successful integration of CS as a compulsory subject within secondary schools.", "authors": [{"name": "maria knobelsdorf", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81361595662"}, {"name": "johannes magenheim", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100483936"}, {"name": "torsten brinda", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100610682"}, {"name": "dieter engbring", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658711485"}, {"name": "ludger humbert", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100037074"}, {"name": "arno pasternak", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81456639018"}, {"name": "ulrik schroeder", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100252309"}, {"name": "marco thomas", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658709062"}, {"name": "jan vahrenhold", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100502961"}], "title": "Computer Science Education in North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany\u2014A Case Study", "citations": [{"Name": "Peter Hubwieser ", "Country": "lithuania", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michail N.

Our experience indicates that many computer science students are at this first stage of learning. To help students move beyond this stage, we describe a system and strategy, the PL-Detective, to be used in a Concepts of Programming Languages course. Assignments using this system directly confront students with the notion that they can create knowledge via interactions with the PL-Detective and that discussion with students (rather than asking the instructor) is an effective way of learning how to reason. We present experimental results that show that the PL-Detective is effective in helping students move beyond the stage of received knowledge.", "authors": [{"name": "amer diwan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100202872"}, {"name": "william m waite", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100335317"}, {"name": "michele h jackson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100096919"}, {"name": "jacob dickerson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100556329"}], "title": "PL-detective: A system for teaching programming language concepts", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "15\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "562\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado at boulder colorado", "city": null, "Name": "amer diwan"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado at boulder colorado", "city": null, "Name": "william m waite"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado at boulder colorado", "city": null, "Name": "michele h jackson"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado at boulder colorado", "city": null, "Name": "jacob dickerson"}]}}, "date": {"month": "December", "year": "2004"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Aauw Educational Foundation. 2000.

[Seymour and Hewett 1997].Prior research indicates that female students can be concerned about the insularity of working alone for long periods of time, as they perceive to be the case with computer science and information technology careers. We studied an advanced undergraduate software engineering course at North Carolina State University to characterize the potential of collaborative learning environments created via pair-programming and agile software development to ameliorate this concern. A collective case study of three representative women in the course revealed that they held the following four themes in common: working with others; productivity; confidence; and interest in IT careers. Three conjectures concerning collaboration emerged from our study, including the importance of face-to-face meetings, an increased confidence among women based on product quality, and a reduction in the amount of time spent on assignments. While our findings are not generalized to early undergraduate courses, the young women we studied were at a critical junction in deciding whether to pursue a career in IT upon their near-term graduation. Additionally, we propose a model for future testing with both males and females that connects these three factors with an increased interest in IT careers.", "authors": [{"name": "sarah b berenson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100088468"}, {"name": "kelli m slaten", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100492880"}, {"name": "laurie williams", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100005737"}, {"name": "chih-wei ho", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100318209"}], "title": "Voices of women in a software engineering course: reflections on collaboration", "citations": [{"Name": "Lucas Layman ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Laurie Williams ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kelli Slaten", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kera Z.

A case study of public communication and interaction in a large, research-intensive university's first year computer science courses illustrates a learning environment primarily characterized by elements and behaviors associated with a defensive communication climate. Descriptions of classroom interactions and behaviors illustrate what a defensive communication climate \u201clooks like\u201d in terms of behavior, based on extensive observational research. Interview data demonstrates that defensive communication practices can lead to attrition among women in the major and illustrates ways in which the communication climate that characterizes the major is experienced and interpreted by women in the courses. This data also links defensive communication behaviors with lower confidence among women toward their major --- results consistent with previous studies of the causes of attrition among women in other Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Classroom experiences and behaviors that reflect a more supportive communication climate will be discussed within the context of practices and interactions that professors can engage in to ensure that their courses lean toward a supportive rather than a defensive environment as a way of making computer science learning environments more inclusive.", "authors": [{"name": "kathy garvin-doxas", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100265222"}, {"name": "lecia j barker", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100376931"}], "title": "Communication in computer science classrooms: understanding defensive climates as a means of creating supportive behaviors", "citations": [{"Name": "Elizabeth V.

The study reveals that vicarious learning has a significant impact on female and male computer selfefficacy, and that the impact may be more significant for females.", "authors": [{"name": "cynthia y lester", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339512426"}, {"name": "marcus brown", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100015777"}], "title": "Creating gender parity: an instruction aide's influence", "citations": [{"Name": "Claudia Bauzer Medeiros", "Country": "brazil", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "From subject of change to agent of change: women and IT in Brazil", "Country": "brazil", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "11\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "755\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "tuskegee university tuskegee al", "city": null, "Name": "cynthia y lester"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of alabama tuscaloosa al", "city": null, "Name": "marcus brown"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Duane A.

A survey of 50 students, designed to test the hypothesis that women are more likely to reject the techniques and \u201cway of thinking\u201d of abstraction in programming, casts doubt on the idea that there is any significant difference between female and male attitudes to prepackaged routines.

Such events as the Trinity College Fire-Fighting Home Robot Contest (TCFFHRC) offer rich opportunities for students to apply their skills by requiring design, and implementation of autonomous robots that are tested during competition. Started in 2003, the TCFFHRC Robotics Olympiad offers junior-high and high school students, working alone or in teams, to demonstrate their knowledge by taking a challenging 50-minute written examination in four key areas related to robotics: mechanics, sensors, software, and electronics. The Olympiad comprises a second evaluation medium that supplements a regular contest survey, which has been in place since 1999. The contest survey solicits information about motivation and progress in subject areas from all contest participants--a large and diverse group that includes junior-high and high school students, working engineers, university students, and team supervisors/guides. As a further evaluation step, we have conducted supplementary case studies of courses and curricula at Trinity College and at the Technion. Assessment indicates that the TCFFHRC has achieved its primary goal: to foster and improve robotics education on an international scale.", "authors": [{"name": "igor m verner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100548307"}, {"name": "david j ahlgren", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100459460"}], "title": "Robot contest as a laboratory for experiential engineering education", "citations": [{"Name": "Amruth N.

However, there appears to be a lack of suitable software to support this task. Many of the available programs that support UML focus on developing code and not on enhancing learning. Programs designed for educational use sometimes have poor interfaces or are missing common and important features such as multiple selection and undo/redo. Hence the need for software that is tailored to an instructional environment and that has all the useful and needed functionality for that specific task. This is the purpose of minimUML. It provides a minimum amount of UML, just what is commonly used in beginning programming classes, and a simple, usable interface. In particular, minimUML is designed to support abstract design while supplying features for exploratory learning and error avoidance. It supports functionality that includes multiple selection, undo/redo, flexible printing, cut and paste, and drag and drop. In addition, it allows for the annotation of diagrams, through text or free-form drawings, so students can receive feedback on their work. minimUML was developed with the goals of supporting ease of use, of supporting novice students, and of requiring no prior training for its use. This article presents the rationale behind the minimUML design, a description of the tool, and the results of usability evaluations and student feedback on the use of the tool.", "authors": [{"name": "scott a turner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331505549"}, {"name": "manuel a perez-quinones", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100175306"}, {"name": "stephen h edwards", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100595678"}], "title": "minimUML: A minimalist approach to UML diagramming for early computer science education", "citations": [{"Name": "Robert W.

And although it is common to provide undergraduate courses on computer networks, the typical curriculum focuses on TCP/IP and Ethernet LANs, rarely venturing into the lesser known but commonly used networks such as the controller area network.

In this course, 500--700 students have been enrolled annually during the period 1993--2004. The tools are specifically designed for assessing algorithm simulation exercises in which students simulate the working of algorithms at a conceptual level. Both of these tools allow students to resubmit their solutions after getting feedback. However, the resubmission policy has changed considerably during the period. Those changes reflect the students performance in the exercises. We conclude that an encouraging grading policy, i.e., the more exercises they solve the better grades they achive, combined with an option to resubmit the solution is a very important factor promoting students' learning. However, in order to prevent aimless trial-and-error problem solving method, the number of resubmissions allowed per assignment should be carefully controlled.", "authors": [{"name": "lauri malmi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100372117"}, {"name": "ville karavirta", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100174108"}, {"name": "ari korhonen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100009313"}, {"name": "jussi nikander", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100125367"}], "title": "Experiences on automatically assessed algorithm simulation exercises with different resubmission policies", "citations": [{"Name": "Christopher Brown ", "Country": "israel", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Robert Pastel ", "Country": "israel", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bill Siever ", "Country": "israel", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "John Earnest", "Country": "israel", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ricardo Alexandre Peixoto Queir\u00f3s ", "Country": "israel", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jos\u00e9 Paulo Leal", "Country": "israel", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Peter Brusilovsky ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sergey Sosnovsky", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "25\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "634\n", "Citation Count": "10\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "finland", "university": "helsinki university of technology", "affiliation_string": "helsinki university of technology finland", "city": "espoo", "Name": "lauri malmi"}, {"country": "finland", "university": "helsinki university of technology", "affiliation_string": "helsinki university of technology finland", "city": "espoo", "Name": "ville karavirta"}, {"country": "finland", "university": "helsinki university of technology", "affiliation_string": "helsinki university of technology finland", "city": "espoo", "Name": "ari korhonen"}, {"country": "finland", "university": "helsinki university of technology", "affiliation_string": "helsinki university of technology finland", "city": "espoo", "Name": "jussi nikander"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Bancroft, P., Hynd, J., Santo, F.

The tutors vary in their ability to generate problems, generate answers, grade student answers, and provide feedback. At one end of the spectrum are tutors that depend on hand-coded problems, answers, and feedback. These tutors can be expected to be pedagogically effective, since all the problem-solving content is carefully hand-crafted by a teacher. However, their repertoire is limited. At the other end of the spectrum are tutors that can automatically generate problems, answers, and feedback. They have an unlimited repertoire, but it is not clear that they are effective in helping students learn. Most extant tutors lie somewhere along this spectrum.In this article we examine the feasibility of developing a tutor that can automatically generate problems, generate answers, grade student answers, and provide feedback. We investigate whether such a tutor can help students learn. For our study, we considered a tutor for our Programming Languages course, which covers static and dynamic scope (i.e., static scope of variables and procedures, dynamic scope of variables, and static and dynamic referencing environment of procedures in the context of a language that permits nested procedure definitions). The tutor generates simple and complex problems on each of these five topics, solves the problems, grades the students' answers, and provides feedback about incorrect and missed answers. Our evaluation over two semesters shows that the feedback provided by the tutor helps improve student learning.", "authors": [{"name": "amruth n kumar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100384050"}], "title": "Generation of problems, answers, grade, and feedback---case study of a fully automated tutor", "citations": [{"Name": "Brad Vander Zanden ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michael W.

The focus of this article is on the QuizPACK system, which is able to generate parameterized exercises for the C language and automatically evaluate the correctness of student answers. We introduce QuizPACK and present the results of its comprehensive classroom evaluation during four consecutive semesters. Our studies demonstrate that when QuizPACK is used for out-of-class self-assessment, it is an exceptional learning tool. The students' work with QuizPACK significantly improved their knowledge of semantics and positively affected higher-level knowledge and skills. The students themselves praised the system highly as a learning tool. We also demonstrated that the use of the system in self-assessment mode can be significantly increased by basing later classroom paper-and-pencil quizzes on QuizPACK questions, motivating students to practice them more.", "authors": [{"name": "peter brusilovsky", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100554547"}, {"name": "sergey sosnovsky", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100198369"}], "title": "Individualized exercises for self-assessment of programming knowledge: An evaluation of QuizPACK", "citations": [{"Name": "I-Han Hsiao ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sergey Sosnovsky ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Peter Brusilovsky", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Adaptive Navigation Support for Parameterized Questions in Object-Oriented Programming", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Antonio Carvalho Siochi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "William Randall Hardy", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fan Yang ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Frederick W.

Thus, it is important to find a way to show students its relevance. The concept of program correctness is generally taught as an activity independent of the programming process, hence many CS students perceive it as unnecessary, and even irrelevant. The concept of contracts, on the other hand, is generally taught as an integral part of the programming process. Most CS students have little difficulty understanding the need to establish contracts via preconditions and postconditions. In order to improve teaching program correctness concepts, we implemented ProVIDE, an enhanced integrated development environment (IDE). ProVIDE assists student programmers in contract construction. Rather than asking for both a precondition and postcondition for each of the student's methods, ProVIDE asks the student to simply supply a postcondition. ProVIDE then helps the student construct the appropriate precondition by leading him or her through an axiomatic proof of the method's correctness. Thus, the proof of of the method's correctness is a side-effect of the student's need to construct an appropriate precondition.", "authors": [{"name": "timothy s gegg-harrison", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100138820"}], "title": "Constructing contracts: Making discrete mathematics relevant to beginning programmers", "citations": [{"Name": "Nicole Anderson ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tim Gegg-Harrison", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "17\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "610\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "winona state university winona mn", "city": null, "Name": "timothy s gegg-harrison"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/1141904.1141905", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "valerie j harvey", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81324489918"}, {"name": "susan h rodger", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100464893"}], "title": "Editorial for the special issue on software support for teaching discrete mathematics", "citations": [{"Name": "Joan M.

JERiC is\r\na unique forum, in that the simulation software corresponding to\r\neach of the articles in this issue is available for download and\r\nexecution.The guest editorial in the previous issue of JERiC described how\r\nthese back-to-back special issues came to be dedicated to computer\r\narchitecture simulators. In this issue I would like to focus on\r\npromoting creativity as an important part of being an educator.\r\nWhile the general von Neumann architecture still predominates as it\r\nhas for the last halfcentury, there are clearly new, advanced\r\ntechnologies on the horizon. While part of our role as educators is\r\nto help students master existing technology, we must also nurture\r\nthe seeds of creativity that may someday break the current\r\nparadigms. While it is unclear what the future may hold -- perhaps\r\nbiological, molecular, or quantum computing -- some clues can be\r\nfound in current advanced, specialized research. Just as it is\r\nrecursive to teach how a computer works by simulating a virtual\r\ncomputer on a computer, we can also learn from past and present\r\nspecialized areas to begin developing the future.In this issue we present interactive simulation tools for\r\nteaching the specialized areas of computer architecture. The\r\narticles span from digital logic simulators (Logisim) to historic\r\nmachine simulators (Atari-6502, PDP-8), to a real machine simulator\r\n(DEC Alpha/KScalar), to an embedded system (LegoSim), to parallel\r\ncomputer architectures (High Performance Computer Architecture and\r\nAlgorithm Simulator). Although these simulators are clearly useful\r\nfor teaching general computer architecture, they are perhaps most\r\nvaluable for specialized topics in advanced or elective\r\ncourses.This issue begins with Logisim, a visual simulator for building\r\nand testing digital logic circuits. While general computer\r\narchitecture survey courses have abstracted away from lower-level\r\ndigital logic circuits, this teaching tool is invaluable for\r\ncomputer engineering or electrical engineering courses that focus\r\nspecifically on logic design. Logisim can be used hierarchically,\r\nand is powerful; the author notes that he has successfully created\r\na simple 8-bit CPU in the system.The use of computer simulators provides a number of secondary\r\nbenefits -- the most pertinent is highlighted in the next article\r\non the PDP-8 Emulator. Simulators make it feasible to interact with\r\ncomputers that no longer exist physically (except possibly in a\r\nmuseum). Thus, obsolescence is no longer the dominant obstacle in\r\nteaching computer architecture. An extinct machine is oftentimes\r\nthe best example of an architectural concept or may have the best\r\neducational documentation. A perfect example of an historic\r\narchitecture to study is the PDP-8. The PDP-8 was a breakthrough\r\n12-bit machine in 1965, to which many of our modern architectural\r\nfeatures can be traced. Through this emulator, students can now\r\ninteract with a virtual PDP-8, instead of simply reading about it\r\nin a textbook.The next two articles are related because they both supplement\r\nseminal textbooks in the field by Hennessy and Patterson [1996] and\r\nPatterson and Hennessy [1997]. While the DLX, MIPS, and SPIM series\r\nof simulators are well documented, SLOOP-SMOK and KScalar are new\r\nsimulators that complement these established tools. The SLOOP-SMOK\r\ntoolkit emulates an Atari 6502 (a good choice for student\r\nmotivation) integrated with a machine organization simulator. The\r\nKScalar simulator simulates the DEC Alpha with a wide range of\r\npossible scalar performance enhancements such as pipelining,\r\ncaching, and speculative execution.LegoSim is an important contribution because it focuses on the\r\nsimulation of an embedded system. Embedded systems, defined as a\r\ncomponent in a larger system that relies on its own processor, have\r\nbeen around for decades. However, it was not until the early 1980s,\r\nwhen 16-bit processors performing sophisticated specialized\r\napplications began to appear in automobiles, that designers\r\nrealized the embedded system's almost limitless possibilities for\r\nubiquitous everyday products [Wolf 2002]. However, at present,\r\nalmost all of our educational focus is still on general-purpose\r\ncomputers, even though the number of specialized embedded systems\r\ncurrently dwarfs traditional computing machines by orders of\r\nmagnitude (a fact that we have ignored in part), and this gap is\r\nincreasing. A recent study by the National Academy of Science\r\ndocuments this development [Computer Science and Telecommunications\r\nBoard 2001]. It is my hope that LegoSim will be the first in a long\r\nline of teaching tools for this rapidly expanding area of\r\nstudy.The final article in this issue simulates the tradeoffs of\r\nefficiency and performance inherent in parallel architectures. The\r\nHigh-Performance Computer Architecture and Algorithm Simulator\r\nallows students to design and interact with different forms of\r\nparallelism such as multiple pipelines, multiple processors,\r\nclustered computer systems, and distributed computing systems.\r\nWhile the promise of parallel computing has yet to be realized on a\r\ncommercial scale (to be fair, parallel programming is at least\r\nequally to blame), research continues, and students who learn by\r\nusing this tool may make the difference.The underlying thread weaving through all these articles is the\r\ninteraction with the details of computer architecture: how a\r\ncomputer processes bits at the lowest level (LogiSim), why\r\ncomputers developed the way they did (KScalar, PDP-8, SLOOP-SMOK),\r\nthe future capabilities of embedded processors (LegoSim), and how\r\nto make computers work together (High-Performance Computer\r\nArchitecture and Algorithm Simulator). In this issue it is our\r\nintent that the specialized computer architecture simulators\r\ndescribed here provide powerful teaching tools to facilitate and\r\nenhance student creativity for developing the next paradigms of\r\ncomputer architecture.Finally, I have very much enjoyed serving JERiC and ACM in my\r\ncapacity as guest editor, and I would like to repeat some\r\nacknowledgements from my previous guest editorial, lest anyone\r\nthink I assembled this issue myself. I would like to thank JERiC\r\nCo-Editors-in- Chief Lillian (Boots) Cassel and Ed Fox, Deborah\r\nKnox of the Computer Science Teaching Center\r\n(http://www.cstc.org/), and Jono Hardjowirogo of the ACM Press. I\r\nwould also like to especially thank the many authors and\r\npeer-reviewers with whom I have traded email (about 60 people);\r\nthey have been responsive, patient, and accommodating. This issue\r\nwould not have been possible without them.A special word to the authors of the articles and simulators we\r\ndeclined: acceptance decisions were particularly difficult (60% of\r\nsubmissions were declined). But I encourage you to persevere - this\r\nis truly a growth area and your contributions are needed. Again, I\r\nW.

Students in this course have had some programming experience, and may have taken a one-quarter digital design course. Before Sloop-SMOK, assignments in this course were typically assembly language program implementations of functions related to architecture. The major goals in building Sloop-SMOK were to improve the relevance of homework assignments to machine organization and to emphasize some fundamental concepts of modern processors not easily addressed previously.Sloop-SMOK has two components. The Sloop is a machine architecture designed to allow implementation of a modern version of the 6502, the processor used in one of the early Atari game stations. The Sloop defines a RISC ISA and a set of on-the-fly translations from the original 6502 CISC ISA into Sloop instructions. The Sloop Machine Organization Kit (SMOK) is a general-purpose software machine organization simulator. The components of a SMOK model are at the level of detail found in typical machine organization texts: ALUs, register files, logic gates, and the like. SMOK provides a graphical interface to construct and debug models.As homework assignments, students use SMOK to build Sloop machines that successfully run most original 6502 games. Extensions to SMOK provide specific help with these Sloop models. Of particular importance is support for debugging: SMOK, when used to build a Sloop machine, runs a software 6502 simulator and compares the behavior of the student's Sloop machine against the simulator on a per-memory-operation basis. This feature simplifies debugging of Sloop machine organization by raising an error at the earliest cycle at which the student's machine is known to deviate from correct behavior.Sloop-SMOK, including downloadable software, documentation, and course assignments, is available at http://www.cs.washington.edu/software/SMOK", "authors": [{"name": "b dugan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100533345"}, {"name": "j zahorjan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100499355"}], "title": "The Sloop ISA and the SMOK toolkit", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "7\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "439\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of washington seattle wa", "city": "washington", "Name": "b dugan"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of washington seattle wa", "city": "washington", "Name": "j zahorjan"}]}, "Pages: 5-16": {"references": ["Arase, K. 2000.

KScalar is a graphical simulation tool that facilitates the study of such processors. It allows students to analyze the performance behavior of a wide range of processor microarchitectures: from a very simple in-order, scalar pipeline, to a detailed out-of-order, superscalar pipeline with non-blocking caches, speculative execution, and complex branch prediction. The simulator interprets executables for the Alpha AXP instruction set: from very short program fragments to large applications. The object's program execution may be simulated in varying levels of detail: either cycle-by-cycle, observing all the pipeline events that determine processor performance, or million cycles at once, taking statistics of the main performance issues.Instructors may use KScalar in several ways. First, it may be used to provide demonstrations in lectures or online learning environments. Second, it allows students to investigate the characteristics of specific processor microarchitectures as practical short assignments associated to a lecture course. Third, students may undertake major projects involving the optimization of real programs at the software-hardware interface, or involving the optimization of a processor microarchitecture for a given application workload.A preliminary version of KScalar has been successfully used in several lecture courses during the last two years in the University Aut\u00f3noma of Barcelona. It runs on a x86/Linux/KDE system. The graphical interface has been developed using the KDE and QT libraries. The simulator engine running behind the graphical interface is a heavily-modified version of SimpleScalar.

First, we describe the design and implementation of a simulation environment for an open-source embedded kernel and an intuitive user interface to complement it. Second, the simulator can be used for embedded program development and research as well as instructional purposes in embedded system classes as a replacement or a complement to hands-on experiments with embedded devices.The technical sections of this article stress the suitability of POSIX Threads (Pthreads) in approximating kernel operations in the simulation environment. We specify the prerequisites for using Pthreads as a means to approximate embedded task execution and suggests an I/O-based representation of device information. The experience gained with a sample implementation stresses the importance of a proper match between a Pthreads implementation and an embedded kernel. We demonstrate the adequacy of both the simulation environment and a graphical user interface to aid program development and debugging. Furthermore, the separation of the simulation component from the user interface provides opportunities to utilize each component separately or even combine them with other components. The simulation environment is publically available, and instructions for installation and use are included in the Appendix.

The illustrations demonstrate the benefits of invoking binary representation of numbers, binary complement, bit-by-bit processing, parity considerations, and the reduction of an integer task into a 0/1 task. The solutions to the challenges are presented gradually, encapsulating general algorithmic considerations and problem-solving methods, including invariant properties, stepwise refinement, processing by atomic components, auxiliary coloring, backward reasoning, and inductive generalization. Each of the illustrations is tied to a variety of referenced algorithmic schemes and applications, which employ the aspects demonstrated in this article. The variety of binary aspects, algorithmic considerations, and problem-solving methods make these illustrations appealing teaching resources for computer science educators, in particular in the domain of algorithms.", "authors": [{"name": "david ginat", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100382337"}], "title": "Effective binary perspectives in algorithmic problem solving", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "15\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "924\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "israel", "university": "tel aviv university", "affiliation_string": "tel aviv university tel aviv israel", "city": "tel aviv yafo", "Name": "david ginat"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/772938.772940", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOADBuy this ArticlePDF (74\u00a0KB)APPENDICES and SUPPLEMENTScarlisle.zip(2.34\u00a0MB)\r\n                \u00a0\r\n                The ROBOT Interpreter is an environment for running programs for the ROBOT computer.", "authors": [{"name": "martin c carlisle", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100430002"}, {"name": "keith shomper", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81456609125"}], "title": "ROBOT interpreter", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "8\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "700\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "us air force academy", "city": null, "Name": "martin c carlisle"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "us air force academy", "city": null, "Name": "keith shomper"}]}}, "date": {"month": "June", "year": "2002"}}}, "Volume1": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Pages: 1-3": {"references": ["Lillian (Boots) Cassel , Mark Holliday , Deepak Kumar , John Impagliazzo , Kevin Bolding , Murray Pearson , Jim Davies , Gregory S.

The tool is based on a simple, virtual CPU architecture, called the One Address Machine. A compiler allows us to take programs written in a special programming language, called OAMPL, and transform them into OAM assembly. An OAM assembler/emulator interprets and executes OAM assembly code produced by the compiler or written directly by students. The OAMulator is targeted at non-CS students who take introductory courses in information technology or information systems. Such students are normally exposed to concepts of computer hardware and software, but it is difficult for them to make the connection between the two. The OAMulator takes the mystery out of CPU architecture by letting students gain confidence with the concepts of compilers and binary execution. The Web-based deployment allows students to work on problems in convenient locations, at their own pace, and with rewarding interaction.", "authors": [{"name": "filippo menczer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100513282"}, {"name": "alberto maria segre", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409591789"}], "title": "OAMulator: a teaching resource to introduce computer architecture concepts", "citations": [{"Name": "Linda Null ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Julia Lobur", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "14\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "721\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of iowa iowa city ia", "city": null, "Name": "filippo menczer"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of iowa iowa city ia", "city": null, "Name": "alberto maria segre"}]}}, "date": {"month": "December", "year": "2001"}}, "Issue3es": {"articles": {"Article No.: 1": {"references": ["Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology.

Hence, optimizing production by exploiting the reusability of interactive multimedia elements is mandatory. Reusability can be triggered by a combination of resuable multimedia components and the appropriate use of metadata to control the components as well as their combination.In this article, we discuss the reusability aspects of interactive multimedia content in web-based learning systems. In contrast to existing approaches, we extend a component-based architecture to build interactive multimedia visualization units with the use of metadata for reusability and customizability.In the three-tier model, the lowest layer of the paradigm corresponds  to the programmer (code reusability). The user interface of an educational visualization is located at the top layer where the interaction with the end-user (student) takes place. The educator is located between the top and the bottom layers. This medium layer allows adapting interactive multimedia content according to the needs of the user, applying a predefined set of metadata. The teacher can both adjust the level of explanation and the level of interactivity of an animation, and influence the presentation and the results of the algorithms being illustrated (program reusability). After a theoretical overview, we explain our architecture by giving an example of an application.", "authors": [{"name": "abdulmotaleb el saddik", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100431394"}, {"name": "stephan fischer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100312393"}, {"name": "ralf steinmetz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100171846"}], "title": "Reusability and adaptability of interactive resources in Web-based educational systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Konrad Wulf", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Reusability of eLearning Objects in the context of Learning Grids", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Frank Oldenettel ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michael Malachinski ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dennis Reil", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gultekin Ozsoyoglu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nevzat H.

We show how this model lets programmers focus on the particular logic of their applications, avoiding most of the issues related to collaboration, access control, and network management. The proposed model is organized into three layers on top of a foundation composed of commercial-off-the-shelf services and standard Internet protocols. The service level provides a network-transparent communications layer, database access, and distributed data interchange. The component level offers typical collaborative services, like user management, auditing, user-oriented messaging, higher-level events, project management, and a bulletin board. The application level supports actual applications constructed using the services offered by the underlying layers. A Web-based educational application has been developed over this framework to illustrate the process. This tele-education system, which follows the recommendations of the main institutions involved in the learning technology standardization process, is the second contribution presented by the authors.", "authors": [{"name": "l anido-rifon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100227574"}, {"name": "m j fernandez-iglesias", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332498356"}, {"name": "m llamas-nistal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384602884"}, {"name": "m caeiro-rodriguez", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474650197"}, {"name": "j santos-gago", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81416595604"}, {"name": "j s rodriguez-estevez", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100094232"}], "title": "A component model for standardized web-based education", "citations": [{"Name": "Chung C.
