Like the data stream model, the most important parameter for this model is the amount of internal memory used by such an algorithm. The other key parameters are the number of streams the algorithm uses and the number of passes it makes on these streams. We consider how the addition of multiple streams impacts the ability of algorithms to approximate the frequency moments of the input stream.We show that any randomized read/write stream algorithm with a fixed number of streams and a sublogarithmic number of passes that produces a constant factor approximation of thek-th frequency momentFkof an input sequence of length of at mostNfrom {1,...,N} requires space\u03a9(N1\u22124/k\u2212\u03b4) for any\u03b4>\u20090. For comparison, it is known that with a single read-only one-pass data stream there is a randomized constant-factor approximation forFkusing\u00d5(N1\u22122/k) space, and that by sorting, which can be done deterministically inO(logN) passes using 3 read/write streams,Fkcan be computed exactly. Therefore, although the ability to manipulate multiple read/write streams can add substantial power to the data stream model, with a sublogarithmic number of passes this does not significantly improve the ability to approximate higher frequency moments efficiently.

We refer to the probability of getting the correct value as thecorrectnessof the decoding algorithm.A breakthrough result by Yekhanin [2007] showed that 3-query linear locally decodable codes may have subexponential length. The construction of Yekhanin, and the three query constructions that followed, achieve correctness only up to a certain limit which is 1\u2009\u2212\u20093\u03b4for nonbinary codes, where an adversary is allowed to corrupt up to\u03b4fraction of the codeword. The largest correctness for a subexponential length 3-query binary code is achieved in a construction by Woodruff [2008], and it is below 1\u2009\u2212\u20093\u03b4.We show that achieving slightly larger correctness (as a function of\u03b4) requires exponential codeword length for 3-query codes. Previously, there were no larger than quadratic lower bounds known for locally decodable codes with more than 2 queries, even in the case of 3-query linear codes. Our lower bounds hold for linear codes over arbitrary finite fields and for binary nonlinear codes. Considering larger number of queries, we obtain lower bounds for q-query codes forq>\u20093, under certain assumptions on the decoding algorithm that have been commonly used in previous constructions.

Our new characterization of FPT has a strong connection to the theory of kernelization, as we prove that problems with polynomial kernels can be characterized by obstruction sets whose elements have polynomial size. Consequently we investigate the interplay between the sizes of problem kernels and the sizes of the elements of such obstruction sets, obtaining several examples of how results in one area yield new insights in the other. We show how exponential-size minor-minimal obstructions for pathwidthkform the crucial ingredient in a novelor-cross-composition fork-Pathwidth, complementing the trivialand-composition that is known for this problem. In the other direction, we show thator-cross-compositions into a parameterized problem can be used to rule out the existence of efficiently generated quasi-orders on its instances that characterize theno-instances by polynomial-size obstructions.", "authors": [{"name": "michael r fellows", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548010480"}, {"name": "bart m p jansen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=89758921657"}], "title": "FPT is characterized by useful obstruction sets: Connecting algorithms, kernels, and quasi-orders", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "17\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "76\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "australia", "university": "charles darwin university", "affiliation_string": "charles darwin university australia", "city": "darwin", "Name": "michael r fellows"}, {"country": "norway", "university": "university of bergen", "affiliation_string": "university of bergen norway", "city": "bergen", "Name": "bart m p jansen"}]}, "Article No.: 15": {"references": ["Klaus Aehlig , Stephen Cook , Phuong Nguyen, Relativizing small complexity classes and their theories, Proceedings of the 21st international conference, and Proceedings of the 16th annuall conference on Computer Science Logic, September 11-15, 2007, Lausanne, Switzerland\n", "R.

He and Mayr showed that NL \u2286 CC \u2286 P, and proved that in addition to CCV several other problems are complete for CC, including the stable marriage problem, and finding the lexicographically first maximal matching in a bipartite graph. Although the class has not received much attention since then, we are interested in CC because we conjecture that it is incomparable with the parallel class NC which also satisfies NL \u2286 NC \u2286 P, and note that this conjecture implies that none of the CC-complete problems has an efficient polylog time parallel algorithm. We provide evidence for our conjecture by giving oracle settings in which relativized CC and relativized NC are incomparable.We give several alternative definitions of CC, including (among others) the class of problems computed by uniform polynomial-size families of comparator circuits supplied with copies of the input and its negation, the class of problems AC0-reducible to Ccv, and the class of problems computed by uniform AC0 circuits with AXccv gates. We also give a machine model for CC, which corresponds to its characterization as log-space uniform polynomial-size families of comparator circuits. These various characterizations show that CC is a robust class. Our techniques also show that the corresponding function class FCC is closed under composition. The main technical tool we employ is universal comparator circuits.Other results include a simpler proof of NL \u2286 CC, a more careful analysis showing the lexicographically first maximal matching problem and its variants are CC-complete under AC0 many-one reductions, and an explanation of the relation between the Gale--Shapley algorithm and Subramanian\u2019s algorithm for stable marriage.This article continues the previous work of Cook et al.

Many combinatorial structures that arise in mathematics and in computer science can be represented naturally as graph homomorphisms and as weighted sums of graph homomorphisms. In this article, we study the complexity of counting homomorphisms modulo 2. The complexity of modular counting was introduced by Papadimitriou and Zachos and it has been pioneered by Valiant who famously introduced a problem for which counting modulo 7 is easy but counting modulo 2 is intractable. Modular counting provides a rich setting in which to study the structure of homomorphism problems. In this case, the structure of the graphHhas a big influence on the complexity of the problem. Thus, our approach is graph-theoretic. We give a complete solution for the class of cactus graphs, which are connected graphs in which every edge belongs to at most one cycle. Cactus graphs arise in many applications such as the modelling of wireless sensor networks and the comparison of genomes. We show that, for some cactus graphsH, counting homomorphisms toHmodulo 2 can be done in polynomial time. For every other fixed cactus graphH, the problem is complete in the complexity class \u2295P, which is a wide complexity class to which every problem in the polynomial hierarchy can be reduced (using randomised reductions). Determining whichHlead to tractable problems can be done in polynomial time.

Unfortunately, it has been shown that most interesting functions are not privately computable [Kushilevitz 1989, Brandt and Sandholm 2008]. The unattainability of perfect privacy for many functions motivated the study ofapproximate privacy. Feigenbaum et al. [2010a, 2010b] define notions of worst-case as well as average-case approximate privacy and present several interesting upper bounds as well as some open problems for further study. In this article, we obtain asymptotically tight bounds on the trade-offs between both the worst-case and average-case approximate privacy of protocols and their communication cost for Vickrey auctions.Further, we relate the notion of average-case approximate privacy to other measures based on information cost of protocols. This enables us to prove exponential lower bounds on the subjective approximate privacy of protocols for computing the Intersection function, independent of its communication cost.

Recall that H is said to be an (r,cr,p,q)-sensitive hash family if all pairsx,y\u2208 {0,1}dwith dist(x,y) \u2264rhave probability at leastpof collision under a randomly chosenh\u2208 H, whereas all pairsx,y\u2208 {0, 1}dwith dist(x,y) \u2265crhave probability at mostqof collision. Typically, one considersd\u2192 \u221e, withc> 1 fixed andqbounded away from 0.For its applications to approximate nearest-neighbor search in high dimensions, the quality of an LSH family H is governed by how small its\u03c1parameter\u03c1= ln(1/p)/ln(1/q) is as a function of the parameterc. The seminal paper of Indyk and Motwani [1998] showed that for eachc\u2265 1, the extremely simple family H = {x\u21a6xi:i\u2208 [d]} achieves\u03c1\u2264 1/c. The only known lower bound, due to Motwani et al. [2007], is that\u03c1must be at least (e1/c- 1)/(e1/c+ 1) \u2265 .46/c(minusod(1)). The contribution of this article is twofold. (1) We show the \u201coptimal\u201d lower bound for\u03c1: it must be at least 1/c(minusod(1)). Our proof is very simple, following almost immediately from the observation that the noise stability of a boolean function at timetis a log-convex function oft. (2) We raise and discuss the following issue: neither the application of LSH to nearest-neighbor search nor the known LSH lower bounds hold as stated if theqparameter is tiny.

We bound the expected size of this preimage.Next, using the preceding bound, we prove that two restricted types of backtracking algorithms calledmyopicanddrunkbacktracking algorithms with high probability take exponential time to invert the function, even if we allow the algorithms to use DPLL elimination rules.

A central conceptual contribution in our work is a new way of constructing leveled, fully homomorphic encryption schemes (capable of evaluating arbitrary polynomial-size circuits of a-priori bounded depth), without Gentry\u2019s bootstrapping procedure.Specifically, we offer a choice of FHE schemes based on the learning with error (LWE) or Ring LWE (RLWE) problems that have 2\u03bbsecurity against known attacks. We construct the following.(1) A leveled FHE scheme that can evaluate depth-Larithmetic circuits (composed of fan-in 2 gates) usingO(\u03bb.L3) per-gate computation, quasilinear in the security parameter. Security is based on RLWE for an approximation factor exponential inL. This construction does not use the bootstrapping procedure.(2) A leveled FHE scheme that can evaluate depth-Larithmetic circuits (composed of fan-in 2 gates) usingO(\u03bb2) per-gate computation, which is independent ofL. Security is based on RLWE for quasipolynomial factors. This construction uses bootstrapping as an optimization.We obtain similar results for LWE, but with worse performance. All previous (leveled) FHE schemes required a per-gate computation of\u03a9(\u03bb3.5), and all of them relied on subexponential hardness assumptions.We introduce a number of further optimizations to our scheme based on the Ring LWE assumption. As an example, for circuits of large width (e.g., where a constant fraction of levels have width\u03a9(\u03bb)), we can reduce the per-gate computation of the bootstrapped version toO(\u03bb), independent ofL, by batching the bootstrapping operation. At the core of our construction is a new approach for managing the noise in lattice-based ciphertexts, significantly extending the techniques of Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan [2011b].", "authors": [{"name": "zvika brakerski", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100642797"}, {"name": "craig gentry", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81340489302"}, {"name": "vinod vaikuntanathan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81322508192"}], "title": "(Leveled) Fully Homomorphic Encryption without Bootstrapping", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "216\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "23\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "415\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "israel", "university": "weizmann institute of science", "affiliation_string": "weizmann institute of science", "city": "rehovot", "Name": "zvika brakerski"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm research", "city": null, "Name": "craig gentry"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of toronto", "affiliation_string": "mit and university of toronto", "city": "toronto", "Name": "vinod vaikuntanathan"}]}}, "date": {"month": "July", "year": "2014"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 8": {"references": ["R.

Problem 2 is much harder. We observe that the complexity of Problem 2 is intimately connected to deep conjectures and results in number theory. In particular, if a refined form of theABC conjectureformulated by Baker in 1998 holds, or if the olderLang-Waldschmidt conjecture(formulated in 1978) on linear forms in logarithms holds, then Problem 2 is decidable in P-time (in the standard Turing model of computation). Moreover, it follows from the best available quantitative bounds on linear forms in logarithms, namely, by Baker and W\u00fcstholz [1993] or Matveev [2000], that ifmandnare fixed universal constants then Problem 2 is decidable in P-time (without relying on any conjectures).

A fundamental open question in numerical analysis and computational geometry is whether &mid;S&mid; \u2265 1/2(n \u00b7log N)O(1)whenS\u2260 0. We study a formulation of this problem over polynomials. Given an expressionS= \u2211i=1nci\u00b7 \u221afi(x), whereci\u2019s belong to a field of characteristic 0 andfi\u2019s are univariate polynomials with degree bounded bydandfi(0)\u22600 for alli, is it true that the minimum exponent ofxthat has a nonzero coefficient in the power seriesSis upper bounded by (n\u00b7d)O(1), unlessS= 0? We answer this question affirmatively. Further, we show that this result over polynomials can be used to settle (positively) the sum of square roots problem for a special class of integers: Suppose each integeraiis of the form,ai=Xdi+bi1Xdi\u22121+...+bidi,di> 0, whereXis a positive real number andbij\u2019s are integers.

The constant inO(1), as fixed by our analysis, is roughly 2.We then consider the following more general problem.

Despite their simplicity, current techniques fall short of providing a classification of these predicates in terms of approximability. In fact, it is not easy to guess whether there exists a homogeneous linear threshold predicate that is approximation resistant or not.The focus of this article is to identify and study the approximation curve of a class of threshold predicates that allow for nontrivial approximation. Arguably the simplest such predicate is the majority predicate sgn(x1+ &ctdot; +xn), for which we obtain an almost complete understanding of the asymptotic approximation curve, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture.

The goal of the leader election problem is to elect a unique leader from among distributed parties. In an anonymous network, all parties with the same number of communication links are identical. It is well-known that no classical algorithm can exactly solve (i.e., in bounded time without error) the leader election problem in anonymous networks, even if the number of parties is given. This article devises a quantum algorithm that, if the number of parties is given, exactly solves the problem for any network topology in polynomial rounds with polynomial communication/time complexity with respect to the number of parties, when the parties are connected with quantum communication links and they have the ability of quantum computing. Our algorithm works even when only an upper bound of the number of parties is given. In such a case, no classical algorithm can solve the problem even under the zero-error setting, the setting in which error is not allowed but running time may be unbounded.", "authors": [{"name": "seiichiro tani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81408600366"}, {"name": "hirotada kobayashi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100604191"}, {"name": "keiji matsumoto", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100316564"}], "title": "Exact Quantum Algorithms for the Leader Election Problem", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "29\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "407\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ntt corporation", "city": null, "Name": "seiichiro tani"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "keiji matsumoto", "city": null, "Name": "hirotada kobayashi"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2012"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 8": {"references": ["Sanjeev Arora , Boaz Barak, Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach, Cambridge University Press, New York, NY, 2009\n", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Babai , Lance Fortnow , Noam Nisan , Avi Wigderson, BPP has subexponential time simulations unless EXPTIME has publishable proofs, Computational Complexity, v.3 n.4, p.307-318, Oct. 1993[doi>10.1007/BF01275486]\n", "Charles H.

There, the authors show important results on tree-like Parameterized Resolution---a parameterized version of classical Resolution---and their gap complexity theorem implies lower bounds for that system.The main result of this article significantly improves upon this by showing optimal lower bounds for a parameterized version of bounded-depth Frege. More precisely, we prove that the pigeonhole principle requires proofs of sizen\u03a9(k)in parameterized bounded-depth Frege, and, as a special case, in dag-like Parameterized Resolution. This answers an open question posed in Dantchev et al. [2007]. In the opposite direction, we interpret a well-known technique for FPT algorithms as a DPLL procedure for Parameterized Resolution. Its generalization leads to a proof search algorithm for Parameterized Resolution that in particular shows that tree-like Parameterized Resolution allows short refutations of all parameterized contradictions given as bounded-width CNFs.", "authors": [{"name": "olaf beyersdorff", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384617993"}, {"name": "nicola galesi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100284794"}, {"name": "massimo lauria", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81414602160"}, {"name": "alexander a razborov", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100498409"}], "title": "Parameterized Bounded-Depth Frege Is not Optimal", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "9\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "169\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of leeds", "affiliation_string": "university of leeds", "city": "leeds", "Name": "olaf beyersdorff"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "massimo lauria", "city": null, "Name": "nicola galesi"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of chicago", "city": null, "Name": "alexander a razborov"}]}}, "date": {"month": "September", "year": "2012"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Nir Andelman , Yossi Azar , Motti Sorani, Truthful approximation mechanisms for scheduling selfish related machines, Proceedings of the 22nd annual conference on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science, February 24-26, 2005, Stuttgart, Germany[doi>10.1007/978-3-540-31856-9_6]\n", "A.

The traditional method of representing a game is to explicitly list all the payoffs, but this incurs an exponential blowup as the number of agents grows. We study two models of concisely represented games:circuit games, where the payoffs are computed by a given boolean circuit, andgraph games, where each agent\u2019s payoff is a function of only the strategies played by its neighbors in a given graph. For these two models, we study the complexity of four questions: determining if a given strategy is a Nash equilibrium, finding a Nash equilibrium, determining if there exists a pure Nash equilibrium, and determining if there exists a Nash equilibrium in which the payoffs to a player meet some given guarantees.

The key idea is to use a certain class of string functions as names representing these objects. These are more expressive than infinite sequences, which served as names in prior work that formulated complexity in more restricted settings. An advantage of using string functions is that we can define their size in a way inspired by higher-type complexity theory. This enables us to talk about computation on string functions whose time or space is bounded polynomially in the input size, giving rise to more general analogues of the classes P, NP, and PSPACE. We also define NP- and PSPACE-completeness under suitable many-one reductions.Because our framework separates machine computation and semantics, it can be applied to problems on sets of interest in analysis once we specify a suitable representation (encoding). As prototype applications, we consider the complexity of functions (operators) on real numbers, real sets, and real functions. For example, the task of numerical algorithms for solving a certain class of differential equations is naturally viewed as an operator taking real functions to real functions. As there was no complexity theory for operators, previous results only stated how complex the solution can be.

This result is existential as it does not provide an explicit optimal rounding procedure nor does it allow to calculate exactly the Unique Games hardness of the problem.Obtaining an explicit optimal approximation scheme and the corresponding approximation factor is a difficult challenge for each specific approximation problem. Khot et al. [2004] established a general approach for determining the exact approximation factor and the corresponding optimal rounding algorithm for any given constraint satisfaction problem. However, this approach crucially relies on results explicitly proving optimal partitions in the Gaussian space. Until recently, Borell\u2019s result [1985] was the only nontrivial Gaussian partition result known.In this article we derive the first explicit optimal approximation algorithm and the corresponding approximation factor using a new result on Gaussian partitions due to Isaksson and Mossel [2012]. This Gaussian result allows us to determine the exact Unique Games Hardness of MAX-3-EQUAL. In particular, our results show that Zwick\u2019s algorithm for this problem achieves the optimal approximation factor and prove that the approximation achieved by the algorithm is &ap; 0.796 as conjectured by Zwick [1998].We further use the previously known optimal Gaussian partitions results to obtain a new Unique Games Hardness factor for MAX-k-CSP: Using the well-known fact that jointly normal pairwise independent random variables are fully independent, we show that the UGC hardness of Max-k-CSP is \u2308(k+1)/2\u2309 2k\u22121, improving on results of Austrin and Mossel [2009].", "authors": [{"name": "anindya de", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351599052"}, {"name": "elchanan mossel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100295693"}], "title": "Explicit Optimal Hardness via Gaussian Stability Results", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "9\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "76\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Trinidad and Tobago", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california berkeley", "city": "california", "Name": "anindya de"}, {"country": "Trinidad and Tobago", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california berkeley", "city": "california", "Name": "elchanan mossel"}]}, "Article No.: 18": {"references": ["Howard Aizenstein , Tibor Heged\u0171s , Lisa Hellerstein , Leonard Pitt, Complexity theoretic hardness results for query learning, Computational Complexity, v.7 n.1, p.19-53, Jul. 1998[doi>10.1007/PL00001593]\n", "Dana Angluin, Queries and Concept Learning, Machine Learning, v.2 n.4, p.319-342, April 1988[doi>10.1023/A:1022821128753]\n", "Harry Buhrman , Steven Homer, Superpolynomial Circuits, Almost Sparse Oracles and the Exponential Hierarchy, Proceedings of the 12th Conference on Foundations of Software Technology and Theoretical Computer Science, p.116-127, December 18-20, 1992\n", "Harry Buhrman , Dieter van Melkebeek , Kenneth W.

We use entirely different techniques involving betting games [Buhrman et al. 2001] to remove the NP oracle and improve the lower bound to EXP not C. This shows that it is even more difficult to design a learning algorithm for C than the results of Fortnow and Klivans [2009] indicated. We also investigate the connection between betting games and natural proofs, and as a corollary the existence of strong pseudorandom generators.Our results also yield further evidence that the class of Boolean circuits has no efficient exact learning algorithm. This is because our separation is strong in that it yields a natural proof [Razborov and Rudich 1997] against the class. From this we conclude that an exact learning algorithm for Boolean circuits would imply that strong pseudorandom generators do not exist, which contradicts widely believed conjectures from cryptography. As a corollary we obtain that if strong pseudorandom generators exist, then there is no exact learning algorithm for Boolean circuits.", "authors": [{"name": "ryan c harkins", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81341491240"}, {"name": "john m hitchcock", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100367346"}], "title": "Exact Learning Algorithms, Betting Games, and Circuit Lower Bounds", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "5\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "85\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wyoming", "city": null, "Name": "ryan c harkins"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wyoming", "city": null, "Name": "john m hitchcock"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["Miklos Ajtai. 1983. \u2211<sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>-formulae on finite structures.Ann.

We give the first fixed parameter tractable algorithm that for anunweightedgraph metricMand integerdeither constructs an embedding ofMinto the line with distortion at mostd, or concludes that no such embedding exists. Our algorithm requiresO(nd4(2d+ 1)2d) time which is a significant improvement over the best previous algorithm that runs in timeO(n4d+2dO(1)). Because of its apparent similarity to the notoriously hardBandwidth Minimizationproblem, we find it surprising that this problem turns out to be fixed parameter tractable.We extend our results on embedding unweighted graph metric into the line in two ways. First, we give an algorithm to construct small-distortion embeddings ofweightedgraph metrics. The running time of our algorithm isO(n(dW)4(2d+ 1)2dW), whereWis the largest edge weight of the input graph. To complement this result, we show that the exponential dependence on the maximum edge weight is unavoidable. In particular, we show that deciding whether a weighted graph metricM(G) with maximum weightW< |V(G)| can be embedded into the line with distortion at mostdis NP-complete for every fixed rationald\u2265 2.

On the one hand, we construct NC0proof systems for a variety of languages ranging from regular to NP complete. On the other hand, we show by combinatorial methods that even easy regular languages such as Exact-OR do not admit NC0proof systems. We also show that Majority does not admit NC0proof systems.

In this relaxed version, loosely speaking, the algorithm is allowed to replace the constraints of an instance by some other (possibly real-valued) constraints, and then only needs to satisfy as many of the new constraints as possible.To be more precise, we introduce the following notion of a predicatePbeingusefulfor a (real-valued) objectiveQ: given an almost satisfiable Max-Pinstance, there is an algorithm that beats a random assignment on the corresponding Max-Qinstance applied to the same sets of literals. The standard notion of a nontrivial approximation algorithm for a Max-CSP with predicatePis exactly the same as saying thatPis useful forPitself.We say thatPis useless if it is not useful for anyQ. This turns out to be equivalent to the following pseudo-randomness property: given an almost satisfiable instance of Max-P, it is hard to find an assignment such that the induced distribution onk-bit strings defined by the instance is not essentially uniform.Under theunique games conjecture, we give a complete and simple characterization of useful Max-CSPs defined by a predicate: such a Max-CSP is useless if and only if there is a pairwise independent distribution supported on the satisfying assignments of the predicate. It is natural to also consider the case when no negations are allowed in the CSP instance, and we derive a similar complete characterization (under the UGC) there as well. Finally, we also include some results and examples shedding additional light on the approximability of certain Max-CSPs.", "authors": [{"name": "per austrin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331488414"}, {"name": "johan hastad", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100025353"}], "title": "On the usefulness of predicates", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "12\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "115\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "aalto university and kth royal institute of technology", "city": null, "Name": "per austrin"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "kth royal institute of technology", "city": null, "Name": "johan hastad"}]}}, "date": {"month": "May", "year": "2013"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Scott Aaronson, Quantum Copy-Protection and Quantum Money, Proceedings of the 2009 24th Annual IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity, p.229-242, July 15-18, 2009[doi>10.1109/CCC.2009.42]\n", "Scott Aaronson , Andrew Drucker, A full characterization of quantum advice, Proceedings of the 42nd ACM symposium on Theory of computing, June 05-08, 2010, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA[doi>10.1145/1806689.1806710]\n", "Dorit Aharonov , Oded Regev, Lattice problems in NP \u2229 coNP, Journal of the ACM (JACM), v.52 n.5, p.749-765, September 2005[doi>10.1145/1089023.1089025]\n", "Dorit Aharonov , Amnon Ta-Shma, Adiabatic quantum state generation and statistical zero knowledge, Proceedings of the thirty-fifth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing, June 09-11, 2003, San Diego, CA, USA[doi>10.1145/780542.780546]\n", "Andris Ambainis, Quantum lower bounds by quantum arguments, Proceedings of the thirty-second annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing, p.636-643, May 21-23, 2000, Portland, Oregon, USA[doi>10.1145/335305.335394]\n", "Ambainis, A. 2010.

The method has been first formalized by von Neumann [1951] and has many applications in classical computing. We define a quantum analogue of rejection sampling: given a black box producing a coherent superposition of (possibly unknown) quantum states with some amplitudes, the problem is to prepare a coherent superposition of the same states, albeit with different target amplitudes. The main result of this article is a tight characterization of the query complexity of this quantum state generation problem. We exhibit an algorithm, which we call quantum rejection sampling, and analyze its cost using semidefinite programming. Our proof of a matching lower bound is based on the automorphism principle that allows to symmetrize any algorithm over the automorphism group of the problem. Our main technical innovation is an extension of the automorphism principle to continuous groups that arise for quantum state generation problems where the oracle encodes unknown quantum states, instead of just classical data. Furthermore, we illustrate how quantum rejection sampling may be used as a primitive in designing quantum algorithms, by providing three different applications. We first show that it was implicitly used in the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations by Harrow et al. [2009]. Second we show that it can be used to speed up the main step in the quantum Metropolis sampling algorithm by Temme et al. [2011]. Finally, we derive a new quantum algorithm for the hidden shift problem of an arbitrary Boolean function and relate its query complexity to \u201cwater-filling\u201d of the Fourier spectrum.", "authors": [{"name": "maris ozols", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81416594942"}, {"name": "martin roetteler", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100284936"}, {"name": "jeremie roland", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331503127"}], "title": "Quantum rejection sampling", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "36\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "175\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "canada", "university": "university of waterloo", "affiliation_string": "nec laboratories america and iqc university of waterloo", "city": "waterloo", "Name": "maris ozols"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "nec laboratories america princeton nj", "city": null, "Name": "martin roetteler"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "nec laboratories america", "city": null, "Name": "jeremie roland"}]}, "Article No.: 8": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2493252.2493253", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "eric allender", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82658871757"}, {"name": "shafi goldwasser", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82658672357"}], "title": "Introduction to the special issue on innovations in theoretical computer science 2012", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "13\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "187\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "shafi goldwasser", "city": null, "Name": "eric allender"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["A.

In our model, we have only one chance to make a prediction, but may do so at a time of our choosing. This model is applicable to a variety of situations in which we want to perform an action of fixed duration, and need to predict a \u201csafe\u201d time-interval to perform it.LettingNtdenote the number of 1s among the firsttbits ofx, we say thatxis \u201c&epsis;-weakly sparse\u201d if lim inf (Nt/t) \u2264 &epsiv;.

Thus, we can perform this task with essentially the same success probability as under the much stronger assumption that each bit ofxtakes the value 1 independently with probability &epsiv;.We apply this result to show how to successfully predict a bit (0 or 1) under a broad class of possible assumptions on the sequencex. The assumptions are stated in terms of the behavior of a finite automatonMreading the bits ofx. We also propose and solve a variant of the well-studied \u201cignorant forecasting\u201d problem.

The proofs of these lower bounds follow a proof-by-contradiction strategy that we callresource tradingoralternation trading. An important open problem is to determine how powerful such proofs can possibly be.We propose a methodology for studying these proofs that makes them amenable to both formal analysis and automated theorem proving. We prove that the search for better lower bounds can often be turned into a problem of solving a large series of linear programming instances. Implementing a small-scale theorem prover based on these results, we extract new human-readable time lower bounds for several problems and identify patterns that allow for further generalization.

In the economical caching problem, there is a storage with a certain capacity. For each time step, an online algorithm is given a price from the interval [1,\u03b1], a consumption, and possibly a buying limit. The online algorithm has to decide the amount to purchase from some commodity, knowing the parameter\u03b1but without knowing how the price evolves in the future. The algorithm can purchase at most the buying limit. If it purchases more than the current consumption, then the excess is stored in the storage; otherwise, the gap between consumption and purchase must be taken from the storage. The goal is to minimize the total cost. Interesting motivating applications are, for example, stream caching on mobile devices with different classes of service, battery management in micro hybrid cars, and the efficient purchase of resources.First we consider the simple but natural class of algorithms that can informally be described as memoryless. We show that these algorithms cannot achieve a competitive ratio below \u221a\u03b1. Then we present a more sophisticated deterministic algorithm achieving a competitive ratio of whereWdenotes the Lambert W function. We prove that this algorithm is optimal and that not even randomized online algorithms can achieve a better competitive ratio. On the other hand, we show how to achieve a constant competitive ratio if the storage capacity of the online algorithm exceeds the storage capacity of an optimal offline algorithm by a factor of log\u03b1.", "authors": [{"name": "matthias englert", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331491962"}, {"name": "heiko roglin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81322505306"}, {"name": "jacob sponemann", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82459259557"}, {"name": "berthold vocking", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100492810"}], "title": "Economical Caching", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "20\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "122\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of warwick", "affiliation_string": "university of warwick", "city": "coventry", "Name": "matthias englert"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of bonn", "city": null, "Name": "heiko roglin"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "rwth aachen university", "city": "aachen", "Name": "jacob sponemann"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "rwth aachen university", "city": "aachen", "Name": "berthold vocking"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Noga Alon , Richard Beigel, Lower Bounds for Approximations by Low Degree Polynomials Over Z_m, Proceedings of the 16th Annual Conference on Computational Complexity, p.184, June 18-21, 2001\n", "Noga Alon, Tali Kaufman, Michael Krivelevich, Simon Litsyn, and Dana Ron. 2003.

This result generalizes the XOR lemma for low-degree polynomials over the binary field given by Viola and Wigderson [2008]. The main technical contribution is the analysis of the Gowers norm over prime fields. For the analysis, we discuss a generalized low-degree test, which we call theGowers test, for polynomials over prime fields, which is a natural generalization of that over the binary field given by Alon et al. [2003]. This Gowers test provides a new technique to analyze the Gowers norm over prime fields. Actually, the rejection probability of the Gowers test can be analyzed in the framework of Kaufman and Sudan [2008]. However, our analysis is self-contained and quantitatively better. By using our argument, we also prove the hardness of modulo functions for low-degree polynomials over prime fields.", "authors": [{"name": "andrej bogdanov", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84459147257"}, {"name": "akinori kawachi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100164201"}, {"name": "hidetoki tanaka", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81488651868"}], "title": "Hard Functions for Low-Degree Polynomials over Prime Fields", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "11\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "98\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "hong kong", "university": "university of hong kong", "affiliation_string": "chinese university of hong kong", "city": "xianggangdao", "Name": "andrej bogdanov"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "tokyo institute of technology", "affiliation_string": "tokyo institute of technology", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "akinori kawachi"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "tokyo institute of technology", "affiliation_string": "tokyo institute of technology", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "hidetoki tanaka"}]}}, "date": {"month": "July", "year": "2013"}}}, "Volume7": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Article No.: 16": {"references": ["S.

By invoking two deep extensions of Grothendieck\u2019s inequality, we present an efficient algorithm that gives a constant-factor approximation to the best performance that players can obtain in a given game, both in the case that they have no shared entanglement and that they share unlimited entanglement.

The nucleolus is known to beNP-hard to compute over compact coalitional games, that is, over games whose functions specifying the worth associated with each coalition are encoded in terms of polynomially computable functions over combinatorial structures. In particular, hardness results have been exhibited over minimum spanning tree games, threshold games, and flow games. However, due to its intricate definition involving reasoning over exponentially many coalitions, a nontrivial upper bound on its complexity was missing in the literature and looked for.This article faces this question and precisely characterizes the complexity of the nucleolus, by exhibiting an upper bound that holds on any class of compact games, and by showing that this bound is tight even on the (structurally simple) class of graph games. The upper bound is established by proposing a variant of the standard linear-programming based algorithm for nucleolus computation and by studying a framework for reasoning about succinctly specified linear programs, which are contributions of interest in their own. The hardness result is based on an elaborate combinatorial reduction, which is conceptually relevant for it provides a \u201cmeasure\u201d of the computational cost to be paid for guaranteeing voluntary participation to the distribution process. In fact, the pre-nucleolus is known to be efficiently computable over graph games, with this solution concept being defined as the nucleolus but without guaranteeing that each player is granted with it at least the worth she can get alone, that is, without collaborating with the other players.Finally, this article identifies relevant tractable classes of coalitional games, based on the notion of type of a player. Indeed, in most applications where many players are involved, it is often the case that such players do belong in fact to a limited number of classes, which is known in advance and may be exploited for computing the nucleolus in a fast way.", "authors": [{"name": "gianluigi greco", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100249220"}, {"name": "enrico malizia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436602540"}, {"name": "luigi palopoli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100352139"}, {"name": "francesco scarcello", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100493411"}], "title": "The Complexity of the Nucleolus in Compact Games", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "46\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "72\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "italy", "university": "university of calabria", "affiliation_string": "university of calabria", "city": "cosenza", "Name": "gianluigi greco"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of calabria", "affiliation_string": "university of calabria", "city": "cosenza", "Name": "enrico malizia"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of calabria", "affiliation_string": "university of calabria", "city": "cosenza", "Name": "luigi palopoli"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of calabria", "affiliation_string": "university of calabria", "city": "cosenza", "Name": "francesco scarcello"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["Sergei Artemenko , Ronen Shaltiel, Lower bounds on the query complexity of non-uniform and adaptive reductions showing hardness amplification, Proceedings of the 14th international workshop and 15th international conference on Approximation, randomization, and combinatorial optimization: algorithms and techniques, August 17-19, 2011, Princeton, NJ\n", "Boaz Barak , Moritz Hardt , Satyen Kale, The uniform hardcore lemma via approximate Bregman projections, Proceedings of the twentieth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, p.1193-1200, January 04-06, 2009, New York, New York\n", "Boaz Barak, Ronen Shaltiel, and Avi Wigderson. 2003.

For the natural case where\u03b5\u2032 \u2265 \u03a9(\u03b5\u03b4) and\u03b5\u2265\u03b4O(1), our lower bound implies that \u03a9(\u221a(1/\u03b5) log(1/\u03b4)\u00b7log|F|) advice bits are necessary for a certain type of reduction that establishes a stronger form of the Dense Model Theorem (and which encompasses all known proofs of the Dense Model Theorem in the literature). There is only a polynomial gap between our lower bound and the best upper bound for this case (due to Zhang), which isO((1/\u03b52)log(1/\u03b4)\u00b7log|F|). Our lower bound can be viewed as an analogue of list size lower bounds for list-decoding of error-correcting codes, but for \u201cdense model decoding\u201d instead.", "authors": [{"name": "thomas watson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474690957"}], "title": "Advice Lower Bounds for the Dense Model Theorem", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "39\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "70\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Trinidad and Tobago", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california berkeley", "city": "california", "Name": "thomas watson"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Noga Alon, J\u00e1nos Pach, and J\u00f3zsef Solymosi. 2001.

The only known example prior to this work excludes polynomial kernelizations for the so-called Ramsey problem of finding an independent set or a clique of at leastkvertices in a given graph [Kratsch 2012]. We study the more general problem of finding induced subgraphs onkvertices fulfilling some hereditary property \u03a0, called \u03a0-Induced Subgraph. The problem is NP-hard for all nontrivial choices of \u03a0 by a classic result of Lewis and Yannakakis [1980]. The parameterized complexity of this problem was classified by Khot and Raman [2002] depending on the choice of \u03a0. The interesting cases for kernelization are for \u03a0 containing all independent sets and all cliques, since the problem is trivially polynomial time solvable or W[1]-hard otherwise.Our results are twofold. Regarding \u03a0-Induced Subgraph, we show that for a large choice of natural graph properties \u03a0, including chordal, perfect, cluster, and cograph, there is no polynomial kernel with respect tok. This is established by two theorems, each one capturing different (but not necessarily exclusive) sets of properties: one using a co-nondeterministic variant of OR-cross-composition and one by a polynomial parameter transformation from Ramsey.Additionally, we show how to use improvement versions of NP-hard problems as source problems for lower bounds, without requiring their NP-hardness. For example, for \u03a0-Induced Subgraph our compositions may assume existing solutions of size k--1. This follows from the more general fact that source problems for OR-(cross-)compositions need only be NP-hard underco-nondeterministicreductions. We believe this to be useful for further lower-bound proofs, for example, since improvement versions simplify the construction of a disjunction (OR) of instances required in compositions. This adds a second way of using co-nondeterminism for lower bounds.", "authors": [{"name": "stefan kratsch", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81438598103"}, {"name": "marcin pilipczuk", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413606931"}, {"name": "ashutosh rai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548012183"}, {"name": "venkatesh raman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100054386"}], "title": "Kernel Lower Bounds using Co-Nondeterminism: Finding Induced Hereditary Subgraphs", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "28\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "49\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "netherlands", "university": "utrecht university", "affiliation_string": "utrecht university", "city": "utrecht", "Name": "stefan kratsch"}, {"country": "poland", "university": "university of warsaw", "affiliation_string": "university of warsaw", "city": "warsaw", "Name": "marcin pilipczuk"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "venkatesh raman", "city": null, "Name": "ashutosh rai"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Nir Ailon , Bernard Chazelle , Seshadhri Comandur , Ding Liu, Property-Preserving Data Reconstruction, Algorithmica, v.51 n.2, p.160-182, April 2008[doi>10.1007/s00453-007-9075-9]\n", "Noga Alon , Ronitt Rubinfeld , Shai Vardi , Ning Xie, Space-efficient local computation algorithms, Proceedings of the twenty-third annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete Algorithms, p.1132-1139, January 17-19, 2012, Kyoto, Japan\n", "Arnab Bhattacharyya, Elena Grigorescu, Madhav Jha, Kyomin Jung, Sofya Raskhodnikova, and David P.

Prior lower bounds (for local filters with no additive error, that is, witha=0) applied only to a more restrictive class of filters, for example,nonadaptivefilters. To prove our lower bounds, we construct families of hard functions and show that lookups of a local filter on these functions are captured by a combinatorial object that we call ac-connector.

[2012]. Proving a superpolynomial lower bound for the size of nondeterministic thrifty branching programs would be an important step toward separating NL from P using the tree evaluation problem. First, we show thatRead-Once Nondeterministic Thrifty BPsare equivalent to whole black-white pebbling algorithms, thus showing a tight lower bound (ignoring polynomial factors) for this model. We then introduce a weaker restriction of nondeterministic thrifty branching programs calledBitwise Independence. The best known [Cook et al. 2012] nondeterministic thrifty branching programs (of sizeO(kh&sol;2 &plus; 1)) for the tree evaluation problem are Bitwise Independent. As our main result, we show that any Bitwise Independent Nondeterministic Thrifty Branching Program solving BT2(h, k) must have at least (k2)h/2states. Prior to this work, lower bounds were known for nondeterministic thrifty branching programs only for fixed heightsh&equals; 2, 3, 4 [Cook et al. 2012]. We prove our results by associating a fractional black-white pebbling strategy with any bitwise independent nondeterministic thrifty branching program solving the Tree Evaluation Problem. Such a connection was not known previously, even for fixed heights.Our main technique is the entropy method introduced by Jukna and Z\u00e1k [2001] originally in the context of proving lower bounds for read-once branching programs. We also show that the previous lower bounds known [Cook et al. 2012] for deterministic branching programs for the Tree Evaluation Problem can be obtained using this approach. Using this method, we also show tight lower bounds for anyk-way deterministic branching program solving the Tree Evaluation Problem when the instances are restricted to have the same group operation in all internal nodes.", "authors": [{"name": "balagopal komarath", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658717653"}, {"name": "jayalal sarma", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81448600026"}], "title": "Pebbling, Entropy, and Branching Program Size Lower Bounds", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "37\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "37\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "india", "university": "indian institute of technology madras", "affiliation_string": "indian institute of technology madras chennai india", "city": "madras", "Name": "balagopal komarath"}, {"country": "india", "university": "indian institute of technology madras", "affiliation_string": "indian institute of technology madras chennai india", "city": "madras", "Name": "jayalal sarma"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Sanjeev Arora , Boaz Barak, Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach, Cambridge University Press, New York, NY, 2009\n", "David Arthur , Bodo Manthey , Heiko R\u00f6glin, Smoothed Analysis of the k-Means Method, Journal of the ACM (JACM), v.58 n.5, p.1-31, October 2011[doi>10.1145/2027216.2027217]\n", "Cyril Banderier, Ren\u00e9 Beier, and Kurt Mehlhorn. 2003.

We present a fine classification of query sets up to parameterized logarithmic space reduction. We show that, in the bounded treewidth regime, there are three complexity degrees and that the properties that determine the degree of a query set are bounded pathwidth and bounded tree depth. We also engage in a study of the two higher degrees via logarithmic space machine characterizations and complete problems. Our work yields a significantly richer perspective on the complexity of conjunctive queries and, at the same time, suggests new avenues of research in parameterized complexity.", "authors": [{"name": "hubie chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81552382056"}, {"name": "moritz muller", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442597919"}], "title": "The Fine Classification of Conjunctive Queries and Parameterized Logarithmic Space", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "41\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "41\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "spain", "university": "universidad del pais vasco", "affiliation_string": "universidad del pais vasco san sebastian spain and ikerbasque basque foundation for science bilbao spain", "city": "bilbao", "Name": "hubie chen"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "kurt godel research center universitat wien", "city": null, "Name": "moritz muller"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["M.

The core issue (particularly but not only motivated by iterative compression) is to determine the computational complexity of the following task: given an already inclusion-minimal solution for an underlying (typically NP-hard) vertex deletion problem in graphs, find a smallerdisjointsolution. The complexity of this task is so far lacking a systematic study. We consider a large class of vertex deletion problems on undirected graphs and show that a few cases are polynomial-time solvable, and the others are NP-hard. The considered class of vertex deletion problems includes Vertex Cover (where the compression task is polynomial time) and Undirected Feedback Vertex Set (where the compression task is NP-complete).", "authors": [{"name": "michael r fellows", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100361129"}, {"name": "jiong guo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100085247"}, {"name": "hannes moser", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81327490285"}, {"name": "rolf niedermeier", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100191636"}], "title": "A Complexity Dichotomy for Finding Disjoint Solutions of Vertex Deletion Problems", "citations": [{"Name": "R.

Each player seeks to communicate a message by choosing one of the links, and each player desires to minimize his experienced transmission time (latency). For evaluating the social cost of Nash equilibria, we consider the price of anarchy, which is the largest ratio of the cost of any Nash equilibrium compared to the optimum solution. Similarly, we consider the price of stability, which is the smallest ratio. The main purpose of this article is to quantify the influence of three parameters upon the prices of the game: the total traffic in the network; restrictions of the players in terms of link choice; and fluctuations in message lengths.Our main interest is to bound the sum of all player latencies, which we refer to ascollective latency. For this cost, the prices of anarchy and stability are\u0398(n/t), wherenis the number of players andtthe sum of message lengths (total traffic); that is, Nash equilibria approximate the optimum solution up to a constant factor if the traffic is high. If each player is restricted to choose from a subset of links, these link restrictions can cause a degradation in performance of order \u0398(\\sqrt{m}). The prices of anarchy and stability increase to \u0398(n\\sqrt{m}/t).We capture fluctuations in message lengths through a stochastic model, in which we valuate Nash equilibria in terms of their expected price of anarchy. The expected price is \u0398(n/\\mathbb{E}[T]), where \\mathbb{E}[T] is the expected traffic. The stochastic model resembles the deterministic one, even for the efficiency loss of order \u0398(\\sqrt{m}) for link restrictions.For the social cost function maximum latency, the (expected) price of anarchy is 1\u2009+m2/t. In this case, Nash equilibria are almost optimal solutions for congested networks. Similar results hold when the cost function is a polynomial of the link loads.", "authors": [{"name": "martin hoefer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350574405"}, {"name": "alexander souza", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314486329"}], "title": "Tradeoffs and Average-Case Equilibria in Selfish Routing", "citations": [{"Name": "Tobias Brunsch ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Heiko R\u00f6glin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Cyriel Rutten ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tjark Vredeveld", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Smoothed performance guarantees for local search", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "10\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "228\n", "Citation Count": "5\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "rwth aachen university", "city": "aachen", "Name": "martin hoefer"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "humboldt-universitat zu berlin", "city": null, "Name": "alexander souza"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["Omer Barkol , Yuval Rabani, Tighter lower bounds for nearest neighbor search and related problems in the cell probe model, Journal of Computer and System Sciences, v.64 n.4, p.873-896, June 2002[doi>10.1006/jcss.2002.1831]\n", "Paul Beame , Faith E.

An early result by Morgenstern from 1973, provides an \u03a9(nlogn) lower bound for the unnormalized Fourier transform when the constants used in the computation are bounded. The proof uses a potential function related to a determinant. That result does not explain why the normalized Fourier transform (of unit determinant) should be difficult to compute in the same model. Hence, it is not scale insensitive. More recently, Ailon [2013] showed that if only unitary 2-by-2 gates are used, and additionally no extra memory is allowed, then the normalized Fourier transform requires \u03a9(nlogn) steps. This rather limited result is also sensitive to scaling, but highlights the complexity inherent in the Fourier transform arising from introducing entropy, unlike, say, the identity matrix (which is as complex as the Fourier transform using Morgenstern\u2019s arguments, under proper scaling). This work improves on Ailon [2013] in two ways: First, we eliminate the scaling restriction and provide a lower bound for computing any scaling of the Fourier transform. Second, we allow the computational model to use extra memory. Our restriction is that the composition of all gates up to any point must be a well- conditioned linear transformation. The lower bound is \u03a9(R\u22121nlogn), whereRis the uniform condition number. Well-conditioned is a natural requirement for algorithms accurately computing linear transformations on machine architectures of bounded word size. Hence, this result can be seen as a tradeoff between speed and accuracy. The main technical contribution is an extension of matrix entropy used in Ailon [2013] for unitary matrices to a potential function computable for any invertible matrix, using \u201cquasi-entropy\u201d of \u201cquasi-probabilities.\u201d", "authors": [{"name": "nir ailon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100462608"}], "title": "An Omega((n log n)/R) Lower Bound for Fourier Transform Computation in the R-Well Conditioned Model", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "21\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "21\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "technion israel iit haifa israel", "city": "haifa", "Name": "nir ailon"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Noga Alon, Combinatorial Nullstellensatz, Combinatorics, Probability and Computing, v.8 n.1-2, p.7-29, January 1999\n", "Matthew Anderson , Dieter van Melkebeek , Ilya Volkovich, Derandomizing Polynomial Identity Testing for Multilinear Constant-Read Formulae, Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE 26th Annual Conference on Computational Complexity, p.273-282, June 08-11, 2011[doi>10.1109/CCC.2011.18]\n", "Dana Angluin , Lisa Hellerstein , Marek Karpinski, Learning read-once formulas with queries, Journal of the ACM (JACM), v.40 n.1, p.185-210, Jan. 1993[doi>10.1145/138027.138061]\n", "S.

Our main observation is that a verifier limited to querying a short proof cannot obtain the same soundness as that obtained by a verifier querying a long proof. Moreover, we quantify the soundness deficiency as a function of the proof-length and show that any verifier obtaining \u201cbest possible\u201d soundness must query an exponentially long proof.In terms of techniques, we focus on the special class of inspective verifiers that read at most 2 proof-bits per invocation. For such verifiers, we proveexponentiallength-soundness trade-offs that are later on used to imply our main results for the case of general (i.e., not necessarily inspective) verifiers. To prove the exponential trade-off for inspective verifiers, we show a connection between PCPP proof length and property-testing query complexity that may be of independent interest. The connection is that any linear property that can be verified with proofs of length &ell; by linear inspective verifiers must be testable with query complexity &ap;\u2009log&ell;.", "authors": [{"name": "eli ben-sasson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100149497"}, {"name": "prahladh harsha", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100235447"}, {"name": "oded lachish", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100532182"}, {"name": "arie matsliah", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309498809"}], "title": "Sound 3-Query PCPPs Are Long", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "11\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "222\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "technion haifa israel", "city": "haifa", "Name": "eli ben-sasson"}, {"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "technion haifa israel", "city": "haifa", "Name": "prahladh harsha"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of warwick", "affiliation_string": "university of warwick coventry uk", "city": "coventry", "Name": "oded lachish"}, {"country": "Netherlands", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cwi amsterdam netherlands", "city": "amsterdam", "Name": "arie matsliah"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Noga Alon , L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Babai , Alon Itai, A fast and simple randomized parallel algorithm for the maximal independent set problem, Journal of Algorithms, v.7 n.4, p.567-583, Dec. 1986[doi>10.1016/0196-6774(86)90019-2]\n", "Laszlo Babai , Peter Frankl , Janos Simon, Complexity classes in communication complexity theory, Proceedings of the 27th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, p.337-347, October 27-29, 1986[doi>10.1109/SFCS.1986.15]\n", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Babai , Noam Nisan , M\u00e1ri\u00f3 Szegedy, Multiparty protocols, pseudorandom generators for logspace, and time-space trade-offs, Journal of Computer and System Sciences, v.45 n.2, p.204-232, Oct. 1992[doi>10.1016/0022-0000(92)90047-M]\n", "Paul Beame , Matei David , Toniann Pitassi , Philipp Woelfel, Separating deterministic from nondeterministic nof multiparty communication complexity, Proceedings of the 34th international conference on Automata, Languages and Programming, July 09-13, 2007, Wroc\u0142aw, Poland\n", "Beame, P. and Huynh-Ngoc, D.-T. 2008a.

Yet over the last decade, we have seen circuit lower bounds (e.g., that PP does not have linear-size circuits) that overcome both barriers simultaneously. So the question arises of whether there is a third barrier to progress on the central questions in complexity theory.In this article, we present such a barrier, which we callalgebraic relativizationoralgebrization. The idea is that, when we relativize some complexity class inclusion, we should give the simulating machine access not only to an oracleA, but also to a low-degree extension ofAover a finite field or ring.We systematically go through basic results and open problems in complexity theory to delineate the power of the new algebrization barrier. First, we show that all known nonrelativizing results based on arithmetization---both inclusions such as IP\u2009=\u2009PSPACE and MIP\u2009=\u2009NEXP, and separations such as MAEXP\u2284\u2009P/poly---do indeed algebrize. Second, we show that almost all of the major open problems---including P versus NP, P versus RP, and NEXP versus P/poly---will requirenon-algebrizing techniques. In some cases, algebrization seems to explain exactly why progress stopped where it did: for example, why we have superlinear circuit lower bounds for PromiseMA but not for NP.Our second set of results follows from lower bounds in a new model ofalgebraic query complexity, which we introduce in this article and which is interesting in its own right. Some of our lower bounds use direct combinatorial and algebraic arguments, while others stem from a surprising connection between our model and communication complexity. Using this connection, we are also able to give an MA-protocol for the Inner Product function withO (&Sqrt;nlogn) communication (essentially matching a lower bound of Klauck), as well as a communication complexity conjecture whose truth would imply NL\u2009\u2260\u2009NP.", "authors": [{"name": "scott aaronson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100520874"}, {"name": "avi wigderson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100459522"}], "title": "Algebrization: A New Barrier in Complexity Theory", "citations": [{"Name": "Ketan D.

The permanent or the determinant modulo 2 is complete for \u2295L, and we show that parity of paths in a layered grid graph (which is bimodal planar) is also complete for this class.

Suchformula cachingalgorithms have been suggested for satisfiability and stochastic satisfiability by several authors. We formalize these methods by developing extensions of the fruitful connection that has previously been developed between DPLL algorithms for satisfiability and tree-like resolution proofs of unsatisfiability. We analyze a number of variants of these formula caching methods and characterize their strength in terms of proof systems. These proof systems are new and simple, and have a rich structure. We compare them to several studied proof systems: tree-like resolution, regular resolution, general resolution, Res(k), and Frege systems and present both simulation and separations. One of our most interesting results is the introduction of a natural and implementable form of DPLL with caching, FCWreason. This system is surprisingly powerful: we prove that it can polynomially simulate regular resolution, and furthermore, it can produce short proofs of some formulas that require exponential-size resolution proofs.", "authors": [{"name": "paul beame", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100038695"}, {"name": "russell impagliazzo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409597088"}, {"name": "toniann pitassi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100025494"}, {"name": "nathan segerlind", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100050424"}], "title": "Formula Caching in DPLL", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "18\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "292\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of washington", "city": null, "Name": "paul beame"}, {"country": "Mali", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california san diego", "city": "san", "Name": "russell impagliazzo"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of toronto", "affiliation_string": "university of toronto", "city": "toronto", "Name": "toniann pitassi"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "intel corporation", "city": null, "Name": "nathan segerlind"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2010"}}}}}}
