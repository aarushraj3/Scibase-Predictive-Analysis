The efficient search of yellow pages is becoming a rapidly evolving research area. The underlying data maintained in yellow pages search engines are typically labeled according to Standard Industry Classification (SIC) categories, and users can search yellow pages with categories according to their interests. Categorizing yellow pages queries into a subset of topical categories can help to improve search experience and quality. However, yellow pages queries are usually short and ambiguous. In addition, a yellow pages query taxonomy is typically organized by a hierarchy of a fairly large number of categories. These characteristics make automatic yellow pages query categorization difficult and challenging. In this article, we propose a flexible yellow pages query categorization approach. The proposed technique is built based on a TF-IDF similarity taxonomy matching scheme that is able to provide more accurate query categorization than previous keyword-based matching schemes. To further improve the categorization performance, we design several filtering schemes. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate encouraging results. We obtain F1 measures of about 0.5 and 0.3 for categorizing yellow pages queries into 19 coarse categories and 244 finer categories, respectively. We investigate different components in the proposed approach and also demonstrate the superiority of our approach over a hierarchical support vector machine classifier.", "authors": [{"name": "zhisheng li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384604845"}, {"name": "xiangye xiao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309482109"}, {"name": "meng wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351595589"}, {"name": "chong wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81542998956"}, {"name": "xufa wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375591473"}, {"name": "xing xie", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81500657110"}], "title": "Towards the taxonomy-oriented categorization of yellow pages queries", "citations": [{"Name": "Fuji Ren ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Haitao Yu", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Role-explicit query extraction and utilization for quantifying user intents", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "27\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "289\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "singapore", "university": "national university of singapore", "affiliation_string": "national university of singapore", "city": "singapore", "Name": "zhisheng li"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "xiangye xiao"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "meng wanghefei university of technology"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "chong wangprinceton university"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "xufa wanguniversity of science and technology of china"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "xing xie"}]}, "Article No.: 15": {"references": ["Al-Shaer, E. and Hamed, H. 2004.

They have been widely deployed for protecting private networks. The quality of the protection provided by a firewall directly depends on the quality of its policy (i.e., configuration). Due to the lack of tools for analyzing firewall policies, many firewalls used today have policy errors. A firewall policy error either creates security holes that will allow malicious traffic to sneak into a private network or blocks legitimate traffic and disrupts normal business processes, which in turn could lead to irreparable, if not tragic, consequences. A major cause of policy errors are policy changes. Firewall policies often need to be changed as networks evolve and new threats emerge. Users behind a firewall often request the firewall administrator to modify rules to allow or protect the operation of some services.In this article, we first present the theory and algorithms for firewall policy change-impact analysis. Our algorithms take as input a firewall policy and a proposed change, then output the accurate impact of the change. Thus, a firewall administrator can verify a proposed change before committing it. We implemented our firewall change-impact analysis algorithms, and tested them on both real-life and synthetic firewall policies. The experimental results show that our algorithms are effective in terms of ensuring firewall policy correctness and efficient in terms of computing the impact of policy changes.

In this article, we propose a framework that supports mining a user's conceptual preferences from users' clickthrough data resulting from Web search. The discovered preferences are utilized to adapt a search engine's ranking function. In this framework, an extended set of conceptual preferences was derived for a user based on the concepts extracted from the search results and the clickthrough data. Then, a concept-based user profile (CUP) representing the user profile as a concept ontology tree is generated. Finally, the CUP is input to a support vector machine (SVM) to learn a concept preference vector for adapting a personalized ranking function that reranks the search results. In order to achieve more flexible personalization, the framework allows a user to control the amount of specific CUP ontology information to be exposed to the personalized search engine. We study various parameters, such as conceptual relationships and concept features, arising from CUP that affect the ranking quality. Experiments confirm that our approach is able to significantly improve the retrieval effectiveness for the user. Further, our proposed control parameters of CUP information can adjust the exposed user information more smoothly and maintain better ranking quality than the existing methods.", "authors": [{"name": "kenneth wai-ting leung", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81388591559"}, {"name": "dik lun lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81385591271"}, {"name": "wilfred ng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81423593726"}, {"name": "hing yuet fung", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81482656079"}], "title": "A framework for personalizing web search with concept-based user profiles", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "54\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "658\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "hong kong university of science and technology", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "kenneth wai-ting leung"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "hong kong university of science and technology", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "dik lun lee"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "hong kong university of science and technology", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "wilfred ng"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "hong kong university of science and technology", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "hing yuet fung"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2012"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Ion Androutsopoulos , John Koutsias , Konstantinos V.

One of the ways to achieve this is by identifying the phenomena that characterize \u201cnormal\u201d observations. Subsequently, based on the characteristics of data learned from the \u201cnormal\u201d observations, new observations are classified as being either \u201cnormal\u201d or not. Most state-of-the-art approaches, especially those which belong to the family of parameterized statistical schemes, work under the assumption that the underlying distributions of the observations are stationary. That is, they assume that the distributions that are learned during the training (or learning) phase, though unknown, are not time-varying. They further assume that the same distributions are relevant even as new observations are encountered. Although such a \u201cstationarity\u201d assumption is relevant for many applications, there are some anomaly detection problems where stationarity cannot be assumed. For example, in network monitoring, the patterns which are learned to represent normal behavior may change over time due to several factors such as network infrastructure expansion, new services, growth of user population, and so on. Similarly, in meteorology, identifying anomalous temperature patterns involves taking into account seasonal changes of normal observations. Detecting anomalies or outliers under these circumstances introduces several challenges. Indeed, the ability to adapt to changes in nonstationary environments is necessary so that anomalous observations can be identified even with changes in what would otherwise be classified as \u201cnormal\u201d behavior. In this article we propose to apply a family of weak estimators for anomaly detection in dynamic environments. In particular, we apply this theory to spam email detection. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposal is both feasible and effective for the detection of such anomalous emails.", "authors": [{"name": "justin zhan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81343510293"}, {"name": "b john oommen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453648179"}, {"name": "johanna crisostomo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81444607948"}], "title": "Anomaly Detection in Dynamic Systems Using Weak Estimators", "citations": [{"Name": "Anis Yazidi ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ole-Christoffer Granmo ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "B.

In this article we show that exposing and using detailed information about how clients use Internet services enables mechanisms that achieve two interconnected goals: (1) providing improved QoS to the service clients, and (2) optimizing server resource utilization. To differentiate among levels of service usage (service access) information, we introduce the notion of theservice access attributeand identify four related groups of service access attributes, encompassing different aspects of service usage information, ranging from the high-level structure of client web sessions to low-level fine-grained information about utilization of server resources by different requests. To show how the identified service usage information can be collected, we implement a request profiling infrastructure in the JBoss Java application server. In the context of four representative service management problems, we show how collected service usage information is used to improve service performance, optimize server resource utilization, or to achieve other problem-specific service management goals.", "authors": [{"name": "alexander totok", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100261251"}, {"name": "vijay karamcheti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100262075"}], "title": "Exploiting Service Usage Information for Optimizing Server Resource Management", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "33\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "420\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "google inc", "city": null, "Name": "alexander totok"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "york university", "affiliation_string": "new york university", "city": "toronto", "Name": "vijay karamcheti"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Michael Benedikt , Christoph Koch, XPath leashed, ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), v.41 n.1, p.1-54, December 2008[doi>10.1145/1456650.1456653]\n", "Michael Benedikt , Wenfei Fan , Floris Geerts, XPath satisfiability in the presence of DTDs, Proceedings of the twenty-fourth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems, June 13-15, 2005, Baltimore, Maryland[doi>10.1145/1065167.1065172]\n", "V\u00e9ronique Benzaken , Giuseppe Castagna , Alain Frisch, CDuce: an XML-centric general-purpose language, Proceedings of the eighth ACM SIGPLAN international conference on Functional programming, p.51-63, August 25-29, 2003, Uppsala, Sweden[doi>10.1145/944705.944711]\n", "Kevin Beyer , Fatma \u00d6zcan , Sundar Saiprasad , Bert Van der Linden, DB2/XML: designing for evolution, Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data, June 14-16, 2005, Baltimore, Maryland[doi>10.1145/1066157.1066299]\n", "Giuseppe Castagna , Kim Nguyen, Typed iterators for XML, Proceedings of the 13th ACM SIGPLAN international conference on Functional programming, September 20-28, 2008, Victoria, BC, Canada[doi>10.1145/1411204.1411210]\n", "Clark, J. and DeRose, S.1999.

In the ever-changing context of the web, XML schemas continuously change in order to cope with the natural evolution of the entities they describe. Schema changes have important consequences. First, existing documents valid with respect to the original schema are no longer guaranteed to fulfill the constraints described by the evolved schema. Second, the evolution also impacts programs, manipulating documents whose structure is described by the original schema.We propose a unifying framework for determining the effects of XML Schema evolution both on the validity of documents and on queries. The system is very powerful in analyzing various scenarios in which forward/backward compatibility of schemas is broken, and in which the result of a query may no longer be what was expected. Specifically, the system offers a predicate language that allows one to formulate properties related to schema evolution. The system then relies on exact reasoning techniques to perform a fine-grained analysis. This yields either a formal proof of the property or a counter-example that can be used for debugging purposes. The system has been fully implemented and tested with real-world use cases, in particular with the main standard document formats used on the web, as defined by W3C. The system precisely identifies compatibility relations between document formats. In case these relations do not hold, the system can identify queries that must be reformulated in order to produce the expected results across successive schema versions.", "authors": [{"name": "pierre geneves", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331492783"}, {"name": "nabil layaida", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100149392"}, {"name": "vincent quint", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100637924"}], "title": "Impact of XML Schema Evolution", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "24\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "391\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cnrs", "city": null, "Name": "pierre geneves"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "inria", "city": null, "Name": "nabil layaida"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "inria", "city": null, "Name": "vincent quint"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Mark Allman , Vern Paxson , Jeff Terrell, A brief history of scanning, Proceedings of the 7th ACM SIGCOMM conference on Internet measurement, October 24-26, 2007, San Diego, California, USA[doi>10.1145/1298306.1298316]\n", "Martin Arlitt , Carey Williamson, An analysis of TCP reset behaviour on the internet, ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review, v.35 n.1, January 2005[doi>10.1145/1052812.1052823]\n", "Paul Barford , Mike Blodgett, Toward botnet mesocosms, Proceedings of the first conference on First Workshop on Hot Topics in Understanding Botnets, p.6-6, April 10, 2007, Cambridge, MA\n", "Barford, P. and Yegneswaran, V.2006.

In this article, we design and implement a Web search method that employs ubiquitous sensors to monitor a user's daily life. Our proposed method automatically searches for a webpage related to a daily activity by using a query constructed from the use of daily objects employed in the activity that is detected with object-attached sensors. We evaluate the search method with real datasets collected from vast numbers of sensors and achieve very accurate webpage retrieval. We then investigate the usefulness and effectiveness of a daily life Web search with Wizard-of-Oz (WOz)-like experiments. We confirm that the presentation of webpages related to daily activities improves participants' future daily lives and triggers communication among the participants in the experiment.", "authors": [{"name": "takuya maekawa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100418496"}, {"name": "yutaka yanagisawa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100312495"}, {"name": "yasushi sakurai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452606482"}, {"name": "yasue kishino", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81343497182"}, {"name": "koji kamei", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100285216"}, {"name": "takeshi okadome", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81312485370"}], "title": "Context-aware web search in ubiquitous sensor environments", "citations": [{"Name": "Lina Yao ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Quan Z.

The Semantic Web enables human knowledge to be machine-readable and the Ubiquitous Web allows Web services to serve any thing, forming a bridge between the virtual world and the real world. By using context, Web services can become smarter\u2014that is, aware of the target things' or applications' physical environments, or situations and respond proactively and intelligently. Existing methods for implementing context-aware Web services on Web 2.0 mainly enumerate different implementations corresponding to different attribute values of the context, in order to improve the Quality of Services (QoS). However, things in the physical world are extremely diverse, which poses new problems for Web services: it is difficult to unify the context of things and to implement a flexible smart Web service for things. This article proposes a novel smart Web service based on the context of things, which is implemented using a REpresentational State Transfer for Things (Thing-REST) style, to tackle the two problems. In a smart Web service, the user's description (semantic context) and sensor reports (sensing context) are two channels for acquiring the context of things which are then employed by ontology services to make the context of things machine-readable. With guidance of domain knowledge services, event detection services can analyze things' needs particularly, well through the context of things. We then propose a Thing-REST style to manage the context of things and user context, and to mashup Web services through three structures (i.e., chain, select, and merge) to implement smart Web services. A smart plant watering-service application demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.", "authors": [{"name": "jing he", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451595810"}, {"name": "yanchun zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81487649465"}, {"name": "guangyan huang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442595048"}, {"name": "jinli cao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451598987"}], "title": "A smart web service based on the context of things", "citations": [{"Name": "Qiang Wei ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zhi Jin", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Pl\u00e1cido A.

Such social rating systems are very convenient and offer alternative learning environments for decision makers, but they open the door for attackers to manipulate the social rating systems by selfishly promoting or maliciously demoting certain items. Although a fair amount of effort has been made to understand various risks and possible defense mechanisms to counter such attacks, most of the existing work to date has been devoted to studying specific types of attacks and their countermeasures. In this article, we argue that vulnerabilities in social rating systems and their countermeasures should be examined and analyzed in a systematic manner. We first give an overview of the common vulnerabilities and attacks observed in some popular social rating services. Next, we describe three types of attack strategies in two types of social rating systems, including a comprehensive theoretical analysis of their attack effectiveness and attack costs. Three context-aware countermeasures are then presented: (i) hiding user-item relationships, (ii) using confidence weight to distinguish popular and unpopular items, and (iii) incorporating time windows in trust establishment. We also provide an in-depth discussion on how these countermeasures can be used effectively to improve the robustness and trustworthiness of the social rating services.", "authors": [{"name": "qinyuan feng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309495718"}, {"name": "ling liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350573402"}, {"name": "yafei dai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323489020"}], "title": "Vulnerabilities and countermeasures in context-aware social rating services", "citations": [{"Name": "Hui Fang ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jie Zhang ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nadia Magnenat Thalmann", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "48\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "559\n", "Citation Count": "6\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "china", "university": "peking university", "affiliation_string": "peking university beijing china and georgia institute of technology", "city": "peking", "Name": "qinyuan feng"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "georgia institute of technology atlanta ga", "city": "atlanta", "Name": "ling liu"}, {"country": "china", "university": "peking university", "affiliation_string": "peking university beijing china", "city": "peking", "Name": "yafei dai"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Gregory D.

We present a novel use of context in the form ofcustomized user interface serviceswith the concept ofUser Interface as a Service(UIaaS). UIaaS takes user profiles as input to generate context-aware interface services. Such interface services can be used as context to augment semantic services with contextual information leading to UIaaS as a Context (UIaaSaaC). The added serendipitous benefit of the proposed concept is that the composition of a customized user interface with the requested service is performed by the service composition engine, as is the case with any other services. We use a special-purpose language (called User Interface Description Language (UIDL)) to model and realize user interfaces as services. We use a real-life e-government application, human services delivery for the citizens, as a proof-of-concept. We also present a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach using a functional evaluation and a nonfunctional evaluation consisting of an end user usability test and expert usability reviews.", "authors": [{"name": "wanita sherchan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309511594"}, {"name": "surya nepal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100296790"}, {"name": "athman bouguettaya", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100532151"}, {"name": "shiping chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319489271"}], "title": "Context-sensitive user interfaces for semantic services", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "93\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "11\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "870\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "australia", "university": "monash university", "affiliation_string": "monash university australia", "city": "clayton", "Name": "wanita sherchan"}, {"country": "Haiti", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "csiro ict centre australia", "city": "centre", "Name": "surya nepal"}, {"country": "australia", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "rmit university australia", "city": null, "Name": "athman bouguettaya"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "csiro ict centre", "city": null, "Name": "shiping chen"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["Georgia M.

We explore techniques to select application-layer measurements, collected by an instrumented media player, that most accurately predict the subjective quality rating that a user would assign to a stream. We consider threefeature subset selectiontechniques that reduce the number of features (measurements) under consideration to ones most relevant to user-perceived stream quality. Two of the three techniques mathematically consider stream characteristics when selecting measurements, while the third is based on observation. We apply the reduced feature sets to two nearest-neighbor algorithms for predicting user-perceived stream quality. Our results demonstrate that there are clear strategies for estimating the quality rating that work well in specific circumstances such as video-on-demand services. The results also demonstrate that neither of the mathematically-based feature subset selection techniques identify a single set of features that is unambiguously influential on user-perceived stream quality, but that ultimately a combination of retransmitted and/or lost application-layer packets is most accurate for predicting stream quality.", "authors": [{"name": "amy csizmar dalal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100457437"}], "title": "User-perceived quality assessment of streaming media using reduced feature sets", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "16\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "232\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carleton college", "city": null, "Name": "amy csizmar dalal"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Sumalatha Adabala , Vineet Chadha , Puneet Chawla , Renato Figueiredo , Jos\u00e9 Fortes , Ivan Krsul , Andrea Matsunaga , Mauricio Tsugawa , Jian Zhang , Ming Zhao , Liping Zhu , Xiaomin Zhu, From virtualized resources to virtual computing grids: the In-VIGO system, Future Generation Computer Systems, v.21 n.6, p.896-909, June 2005[doi>10.1016/j.future.2003.12.021]\n", "Jeannie R.

Although a number of solutions exist for subtasks of application deployment, monitoring, and maintenance in distributed environments, few tools provide a unified framework for application management. Many of the existing tools address the management needs of a single type of application or service that runs in a specific environment, and these tools are not adaptable enough to be used for other applications or platforms. To this end, we present the design and implementation of Plush, a fully configurable application management infrastructure designed to meet the general requirements of several different classes of distributed applications. Plush allows developers to specifically define the flow of control needed by their computations using application building blocks. Through an extensible resource management interface, Plush supports execution in a variety of environments, including both live deployment platforms and emulated clusters. Plush also uses relaxed synchronization primitives for improving fault tolerance and liveness in failure-prone environments. To gain an understanding of how Plush manages different classes of distributed applications, we take a closer look at specific applications and evaluate how Plush provides support for each.", "authors": [{"name": "jeannie albrecht", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100358372"}, {"name": "christopher tuttle", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332532539"}, {"name": "ryan braud", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331489344"}, {"name": "darren dao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418594893"}, {"name": "nikolay topilski", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350585766"}, {"name": "alex c snoeren", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100242160"}, {"name": "amin vahdat", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100104394"}], "title": "Distributed application configuration, management, and visualization with plush", "citations": [{"Name": "Ian Unruh ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alexandru G.

They have been realized on top of SSL/TLS, which is the de facto protocol for end-to-end secure communication over the Internet. In an attempt to achieve a cognitive SSL/TLS with heterogeneous environments (device, network, and cloud) and workload awareness, we thoroughly analyze SSL/TLS-based data communication and identify three critical mismatches in a conventional SSL/TLS-based data transmission. The first mismatch is the performance of loosely coupled encryption-compression and communication routines that lead to underutilized computation and communication resources. The second mismatch is that the conventional SSL/TLS only provides a static compression mode, irrespective of the dynamically changing status of each SSL/TLS connection and the computing power gap between the cloud service provider and diverse device platforms. The third is the memory allocation overhead due to frequent compression switching in the SSL/TLS. As a remedy to these rudimentary operations, we present a system called an Adaptive Cryptography Plugged Compression Network (ACCENT) for SSL/TLS-based cloud services. It is comprised of the following three novel mechanisms, each of which aims to provide an optimal SSL/TLS communication and maximize the network transfer performance of an SSL/TLS protocol stack: tightly-coupled threaded SSL/TLS coding, floating scale-based adaptive compression negotiation, and unified memory allocation for seamless compression switching. We implemented and tested the mechanisms in OpenSSL-1.0.0. ACCENT is integrated into the Web-interface layer and SSL/TLS-based secure storage service within a real cloud computing service, callediCubeCloud, as the key primitive for SSL/TLS-based data delivery over the Internet.", "authors": [{"name": "ki-woong park", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81349487508"}, {"name": "kyu ho park", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351598076"}], "title": "ACCENT: Cognitive cryptography plugged compression for SSL/TLS-based cloud computing services", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "61\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "632\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "austria", "university": "institute of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "korea advanced institute of science and technology daejeon korea", "city": "klosterneuburg", "Name": "ki-woong park"}, {"country": "austria", "university": "institute of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "korea advanced institute of science and technology daejeon korea", "city": "klosterneuburg", "Name": "kyu ho park"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Butler, K., Farley, T., McDaniel, P., and Rexford, J. 2004.

The importance of computer networks reaches far beyond the telecommunications sector since they have become a critical factor for many other crucial infrastructures and markets. With threats mounting and security incidents becoming more frequent, concerns about network security grow.It is an acknowledged fact that some of the most fundamental network protocols that make the Internet work are exposed to serious threats. One of them is the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) which determines how Internet traffic is routed through the topology of administratively independent networks that the Internet is comprised of. Despite the existence of a steadily growing number of BGP security proposals, to date none of them has been adopted.Using a precise definition of BGP robustness we experimentally show that the degree of robustness is distributed unequally across the administrative domains of the Internet, the so-called Autonomous Systems (ASes). The experiments confirm the intuition that the contribution ASes are able to make towards securing the correct working of the inter-domain routing infrastructure by deploying countermeasures against routing attacks differ depending on their position in the AS topology. We also show that the degree of this asymmetry can be controlled by the choice of the security strategy. We compare the strengths and weaknesses of two fundamentally different approaches in increasing BGP's robustness which we termed ingress and egress detection of false route advertisements and indicate their implications. Our quantitative results have important implications for Internet security policy, in particular with respect to the crucial question where to start the deployment of which type of security scheme in order to maximize the Internet's robustness to routing attacks.", "authors": [{"name": "christoph goebel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81482650401"}, {"name": "dirk neumann", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323494132"}, {"name": "ramayya krishnan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100273575"}], "title": "Comparing ingress and egress detection to secure interdomain routing: An experimental analysis", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "28\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "270\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "international computer science institute berkeley ca", "city": null, "Name": "christoph goebel"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "albert-ludwigs-universitat freiburg germany", "city": "freiburg", "Name": "dirk neumann"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa", "city": "pittsburgh", "Name": "ramayya krishnan"}]}}, "date": {"month": "December", "year": "2011"}}}, "Volume9": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Article No.: 16": {"references": ["Adamic, L. 2000.

This problem has several interesting instances encountered in different applications, ranging from assessing the distribution of load between network nodes for load balancing purposes, to measuring node utilization for optimal resource exploitation, and to guiding autonomous decisions of nodes in networks built with market-based economic principles. Although some metrics have been proposed, particularly for assessing load balancing algorithms, they fall short. We first study the appropriateness of various known and previously proposed statistical metrics for measuring distribution fairness. We put forward a number of required characteristics for appropriate metrics. We propose and comparatively study the appropriateness of the Gini coefficient (G) for this task. Our study reveals as most appropriate the metrics ofG, the fairness index (FI), and the coefficient of variation (CV) in this order. Second, we develop six distributed sampling algorithms to estimate metrics online efficiently, accurately, and scalably. One of these algorithms (2-PRWS) is based on two effective optimizations of a basic algorithm, and the other two (the sequential sampling algorithm,LBS-HL, and the clustered sampling one,EBSS) are novel, developed especially to estimateG. Third, we show how these metrics, and especiallyG, can be readily utilized online by higher-level algorithms, which can now know when to best intervene to correct unfair distributions (in particular, load imbalances). We conclude with a comprehensive experimentation which comparatively evaluates both the various proposed estimation algorithms and the three most appropriate metrics (G,CV, andFI). Specifically, the evaluation quantifies the efficiency (in terms of number of the messages and a latency indicator), precision, and accuracy achieved by the proposed algorithms when estimating the competing fairness metrics. The central conclusion is that the proposed metric,G, can be estimated with a small number of messages and latency, regardless of the skew of the underlying distribution.", "authors": [{"name": "theoni pitoura", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435609027"}, {"name": "peter triantafillou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100489302"}], "title": "Distribution fairness in Internet-scale networks", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "19\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "515\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "greece", "university": "university of patras", "affiliation_string": "university of patras patras greece", "city": "patrai", "Name": "theoni pitoura"}, {"country": "greece", "university": "university of patras", "affiliation_string": "university of patras patras greece", "city": "patrai", "Name": "peter triantafillou"}]}, "Article No.: 15": {"references": ["Sudhir Aggarwal , Hemant Banavar , Sarit Mukherjee , Sampath Rangarajan, Fairness in dead-reckoning based distributed multi-player games, Proceedings of 4th ACM SIGCOMM workshop on Network and system support for games, October 10-11, 2005, Hawthorne, NY[doi>10.1145/1103599.1103608]\n", "Armitage, G. 2003.

This article proposes the use of remote feedback as a method of maintaining a desired consistency level within a peer-to-peer DIA. Though many existing techniques attempt to maintain consistency within a DIA, they operate in an open-loop manner and do not take error introduced into the system due to transmission delay into consideration. The goal of the work presented in this article is to transform this open-loop scheme into a closed-loop control system utilizing feedback from the remote users. By incorporating remote error into the systems update paradigm, the Protocol Data Unit (PDU) transmission rate can be dynamically altered to reflect changing network conditions.

In a typical pub-sub system, subscribed users specify their interests in a profile expressed in the XPath language. Each new data content is then matched against the user profiles so that the content is delivered only to the interested subscribers. As the number of subscribed users and their profiles can grow very large, the scalability of the service is critical to the success of pub-sub systems. In this article, we propose a novel scalable filtering system called iFiST that transforms user profiles of a twig pattern expressed in XPath into sequences using the Pr\u00fcfer's method. Consequently, instead of breaking a twig pattern into multiple linear paths and matching them separately, FiST performsholistic matchingof twig patterns with each incoming document in abottom-upfashion. FiST organizes the sequences into a dynamic hash-based index for efficient filtering, and exploits the commonality among user profiles to enable shared processing during the filtering phase. We demonstrate that the holistic matching approach reduces filtering cost and memory consumption, thereby improving the scalability of FiST.", "authors": [{"name": "joonho kwon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331497162"}, {"name": "praveen rao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452601035"}, {"name": "bongki moon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100243760"}, {"name": "sukho lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100411258"}], "title": "Fast XML document filtering by sequencing twig patterns", "citations": [{"Name": "Xiaoling Wang ", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ester Martin ", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Weining Qian ", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Aoying Zhou", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mohammad Sadoghi ", "Country": "sweden", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ioana Burcea ", "Country": "sweden", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hans-Arno Jacobsen", "Country": "sweden", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "16\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "508\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "joonho kwon"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "praveen raouniversity of missouri-kansas city kansas city mo"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "bongki moonuniversity of arizona az"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "sukho lee"}]}}, "date": {"month": "September", "year": "2009"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Marcos K.

Through tools such as Yahoo Pipes, these \u201cmash-ups\u201d can be composed in a dynamic, just-in-time manner from components provided by multiple institutions (i.e., Google, Amazon, your neighbor). However, when using these applications, it is not apparent where data comes from or how it is processed. Thus, to inspire trust and confidence in mash-ups, it is critical to be able to analyze their processes after the fact. Thesetrailing analyses, in particular the determination of the provenance of a result (i.e., the process that led to it), are enabled byprocess documentation, which is documentation of an application's past process created by the components of that application at execution time. In this article, we define a generic conceptual data model that supports the autonomous creation of attributable, factual process documentation for dynamic multi-institutional applications. The data model is instantiated using two Internet formats, OWL and XML, and is evaluated with respect to questions about the provenance of results generated by a complex bioinformatics mash-up.", "authors": [{"name": "paul groth", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100235330"}, {"name": "simon miles", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100598085"}, {"name": "luc moreau", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100006426"}], "title": "A model of process documentation to determine provenance in mash-ups", "citations": [{"Name": "Fang Liu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ritu Mundhe ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Masha Sosonkina ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chase Cockrell ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Miles Aronnax ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Pieter Maris ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "James P.

The primary contribution of our work is to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of overbooking resources in shared Internet platforms. Since an accurate estimate of an application's resource needs is necessary when overbooking resources, we present techniques to profile applications on dedicated nodes, possibly while in service, and use these profiles to guide the placement of application components onto shared nodes. We then propose techniques to overbook cluster resources in a controlled fashion. We outline an empirical appraoch to determine the degree of overbooking that allows a platform to achieve improvements in revenue while providing performance guarantees to Internet applications. We show how our techniques can be combined with commonly used QoS resource allocation mechanisms to provide application isolation and performance guarantees at run-time. We implement our techniques in a Linux cluster and evaluate them using common server applications. We find that the efficiency (and consequently revenue) benefits from controlled overbooking of resources can be dramatic. Specifically, we find that overbooking resources by as little as 1&percnt; we can increase the utilization of the cluster by a factor of two, and a 5&percnt; overbooking yields a 300--500&percnt; improvement, while still providing useful resource guarantees to applications.", "authors": [{"name": "bhuvan urgaonkar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100318035"}, {"name": "prashant shenoy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100334109"}, {"name": "timothy roscoe", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100341569"}], "title": "Resource overbooking and application profiling in a shared Internet hosting platform", "citations": [{"Name": "Saeed Sharifian ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Seyed A.

In this article, we focus on P2P file sharing applications, where spontaneous communities of users are studied and analyzed. We define a family of structures that we call \u201cAffinity Networks\u201d (or even Graphs) that show self-organized interest-based clusters. Empirical evidence proves that affinity networks are small worlds and shows scale-free features. The relevance of this finding is augmented with the introduction of a proactive recommendation scheme, namelyDeHinter, that exploits this natural feature. The intuition behind this scheme is that a user would trust her network of \u201celective affinities\u201d more than anonymous and generic suggestions made by impersonal entities. The accuracy of the recommendation is evaluated by way of a 10-fold cross validation, and a prototype has been implemented for further feedbacks from the users.", "authors": [{"name": "giancarlo ruffo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100521826"}, {"name": "rossano schifanella", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100596574"}], "title": "A peer-to-peer recommender system based on spontaneous affinities", "citations": [{"Name": "Francesca Carmagnola ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andrea Loffredo ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Giorgio Berardi", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "J.

These services are described using machine-readable metadata, which enables consumer applications to automatically discover and provision suitable services for their workflows at run-time. However, current approaches have typically assumed service descriptions are accurate and deterministic, and so have neglected to account for the fact that services in these open systems are inherently unreliable and uncertain. Specifically, network failures, software bugs and competition for services may regularly lead to execution delays or even service failures. To address this problem, the process of provisioning services needs to be performed in a more flexible manner than has so far been considered, in order to proactively deal with failures and to recover workflows that have partially failed. To this end, we devise and present a heuristic strategy that varies the provisioning of services according to their predicted performance. Using simulation, we then benchmark our algorithm and show that it leads to a 700&percnt; improvement in average utility, while successfully completing up to eight times as many workflows as approaches that do not consider service failures.", "authors": [{"name": "sebastian stein", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81365595987"}, {"name": "terry r payne", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100557779"}, {"name": "nicholas r jennings", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100581072"}], "title": "Flexible provisioning of web service workflows", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "26\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "1419\n", "Citation Count": "10\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of southampton", "affiliation_string": "university of southampton southampton united kingdom", "city": "southampton", "Name": "sebastian stein"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of southampton", "affiliation_string": "university of southampton southampton united kingdom", "city": "southampton", "Name": "terry r payne"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of southampton", "affiliation_string": "university of southampton southampton united kingdom", "city": "southampton", "Name": "nicholas r jennings"}]}}, "date": {"month": "February", "year": "2009"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Witold Abramowicz , Konstanty Haniewicz , Monika Kaczmarek , Dominik Zyskowski, Architecture for Web Services Filtering and Clustering, Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Internet and Web Applications and Services, p.18, May 13-19, 2007[doi>10.1109/ICIW.2007.19]\n", "Periklis Andritsos , Vassilios Tzerpos, Software Clustering based on Information Loss Minimization, Proceedings of the 10th Working Conference on Reverse Engineering, p.334, November 13-17, 2003\n", "Boualem Benatallah , Mohand-Said Hacid , Alain Leger , Christophe Rey , Farouk Toumani, On automating Web services discovery, The VLDB Journal \u2014 The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases, v.14 n.1, p.84-96, March 2005[doi>10.1007/s00778-003-0117-x]\n", "James Caverlee , Ling Liu , Daniel Rocco, Discovering and ranking web services with BASIL: a personalized approach with biased focus, Proceedings of the 2nd international conference on Service oriented computing, November 15-19, 2004, New York, NY, USA[doi>10.1145/1035167.1035190]\n", "Christensen, E., Curbera, F., Meredith, G., and Weerawarana, S. 2001.

The goal is to retrieve services that match the user's requirements. With the growing number of services in the repositories and the challenges of quickly finding the right ones, the need for clustering related services becomes evident to enhance search engine results with a list of similar services for each hit. In this article, a statistical clustering approach is presented that enhances an existing distributed vector space search engine for Web services with the possibility of dynamically calculating clusters of similar services for each hit in the list found by the search engine. The focus is laid on a very efficient and scalable clustering implementation that can handle very large service repositories. The evaluation with a large service repository demonstrates the feasibility and performance of the approach.", "authors": [{"name": "christian platzer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310490818"}, {"name": "florian rosenberg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81300393701"}, {"name": "schahram dustdar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100508435"}], "title": "Web service clustering using multidimensional angles as proximity measures", "citations": [{"Name": "Shuai Zhao ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yang Zhang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Le Yu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bo Cheng ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yang Ji ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Junliang Chen", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "A multidimensional resource model for dynamic resource matching in internet of things", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Cristina Bianca Pop ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Viorica Rozina Chifu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ioan Salomie ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mihaela Dinsoreanu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tudor David ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Vlad Acretoaie ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Aliz Nagy ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ciprian Oprisa", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Biologically-inspired clustering of semantic Web services.

In recent years the extreme growth of digital documents brought to light the need for novel approaches and more efficient techniques to improve the accuracy of IR systems to take into account real users' information needs. In this article we propose a novel metric to measure the semantic relatedness between words. Our approach is based on ontologies represented using a general knowledge base for dynamically building a semantic network. This network is based on linguistic properties and it is combined with our metric to create a measure of semantic relatedness. In this way we obtain an efficient strategy to rank digital documents from the Internet according to the user's interest domain. The proposed methods, metrics, and techniques are implemented in a system for information retrieval on the Web. Experiments are performed on a test set built using a directory service having information about analyzed documents. The obtained results compared to other similar systems show an effective improvement.", "authors": [{"name": "antonio m rinaldi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81372592216"}], "title": "An ontology-driven approach for semantic information retrieval on the Web", "citations": [{"Name": "Dhanasekaran Kuttiyapillai ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "R.

Due to the complexity of commercial Web sites that may include hundreds of Web pages for many big corporations, there may inevitably exist uncertainties when human assessors express their subjective judgments in assessing e-commerce Web sites. Fuzzy set theory is widely used to model uncertain and imprecise information in applications. Prior studies in e-commerce Web site assessment identified some key factors to assess commercial Web sites by using a numeric assessment scale that may not be effective and efficient in modeling uncertainty. This study intends to propose an e-commerce Web site assessment framework using a fuzzy classification approach. Based on this framework, a Web-based e-commerce assessment system was designed and developed, which can provide online assessment services to corporations on evaluating their commercial Web sites. An empirical investigation into assessing commercial Web sites of the top 120 Fortune Corporations of the USA was conducted using the developed online assessment system to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed framework.

According to a recent survey made by Technorati, there are about 75,000 new blogs and 1.2 million new posts everyday. However, it is difficult and time consuming for a blog reader to find the most interesting posts in the huge and dynamic blog world. In this article, an online Personalized Blog Reader (PBR) system is proposed, which facilitates blog readers in browsing the coolest and newest blog posts of their interests by automatically clustering the most relevant stories. PBR aims to make a user's potential favorite topics always ranked higher than those nonfavorite ones. This is accomplished in the following steps. First, the system collects and provides a unified incremental index of posts coming from different blogs. Then, an incremental clustering algorithm with a flexible half-bounded window of observation is proposed to satisfy the requirements of online processing. It learns people's personalized reading preferences to present a user with a final reading list. The experimental results show that the proposed incremental clustering algorithm is effective and efficient, and the personalization of the PBR performs well.", "authors": [{"name": "xin li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81542069656"}, {"name": "jun yan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100045080"}, {"name": "weiguo fan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81381591210"}, {"name": "ning liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81321494547"}, {"name": "shuicheng yan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100044797"}, {"name": "zheng chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81416601059"}], "title": "An online blog reading system by topic clustering and personalized ranking", "citations": [{"Name": "Yijuan Lu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nicu Sebe ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ross Hytnen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Qi Tian", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "47\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "1111\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "china", "university": "peking university", "affiliation_string": "peking university", "city": "peking", "Name": "xin li"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research asia", "city": null, "Name": "jun yan"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "virginia tech", "city": null, "Name": "weiguo fan"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research asia", "city": null, "Name": "ning liu"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": "national university of singapore", "affiliation_string": "national university of singapore", "city": "singapore", "Name": "shuicheng yan"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research asia", "city": null, "Name": "zheng chen"}]}}, "date": {"month": "July", "year": "2009"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 8": {"references": ["Chow, Y.

We can imagine that in the future this trend will actually be extended to situations where virtual buyer and seller agents will conduct automated transactions across the network, and that large sectors of the economy may be strucured in this manner. The purpose of this article is to model automated bidders and sellers which interact through a network. We model the bidding process as a random arrival process while the price attained by a good is modeled as a discrete random variable. We obtain analytical solutions allowing us to compute the income from a single auction, or the income per unit time from a repeated sequence of auctions. A variety of single-auction models are studied, including English and Vickrey auctions, and the income per unit time is derived as a function of other parameters, including the rate of arrival of bids, the seller's decision time, the value of the good, and the \u201crest time\u201d of the seller between successive auctions. We illustrate the results via numerical examples. We also introduce a model for networked auctions where bidders can circulate among a set of interconnected auctions which we call the Mobile Bidder Model (MBM). We obtain an analytical solution for the MBM under the assumption,which we call the \u201cactive bidders assumption,\u201d that activities that are internal to an auction (bids and sales) are much more frequent than changes that occur in the number of bidders at each auction.", "authors": [{"name": "erol gelenbe", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100492044"}], "title": "Analysis of single and networked auctions", "citations": [{"Name": "Erol Gelenbe ", "Country": "sweden", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kumaara Velan", "Country": "sweden", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "An Approximate Model for Bidders in Sequential Automated Auctions", "Country": "sweden", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kumaara Velan ", "Country": "poland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Erol Gelenbe", "Country": "poland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Analysing bidder performance in randomised and fixed-deadline automated auctions", "Country": "poland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Timothy L.

The framework ensures high autonomy to participating sources as it does not rely on a global schema or on semantic mappings between schemas. The basic intuition is that of extending traditional approaches for approximate query evaluation, by providing techniques for combining partial answers coming from different sources, possibly on the basis of limited knowledge about the local schemas (i.e., key constraints). We define a query language and its associated semantics, that allows us to collect as much information as possible from several heterogeneous XML sources. We provide algorithms for query evaluation and characterize the complexity of the query language. Finally, we validate the approach in a medical application scenario.", "authors": [{"name": "bettina fazzinga", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81421595937"}, {"name": "sergio flesca", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100567702"}, {"name": "andrea pugliese", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100366308"}], "title": "Retrieving XML data from heterogeneous sources through vague querying", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "12\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "493\n", "Citation Count": "4\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "deis - universita della calabria rende cs italy", "city": "calabria", "Name": "bettina fazzinga"}, {"country": "Italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "deis - universita della calabria rende cs italy", "city": "calabria", "Name": "sergio flesca"}, {"country": "Italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "deis - universita della calabria rende cs italy", "city": "calabria", "Name": "andrea pugliese"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Bar, F., Cohen, S.

The United States Congress is considering legislation on net neutrality, and debate over the issue has generated intense lobbying. Congressional action will substantially affect the evolution of the Internet and of future Internet research. In this article, we argue that neither the pro nor anti net neutrality positions are consistent with the philosophy of Internet architecture. We develop a net neutrality policy founded on a segmentation of Internet services into infrastructure services and application services, based on the Internet's layered architecture. Our net neutrality policy restricts an Internet service Provider's ability to engage in anticompetitive behavior while simultaneously ensuring that it can use desirable forms of network management. We illustrate the effect of this policy by discussing acceptable and unacceptable uses of network management.", "authors": [{"name": "scott jordan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100368395"}], "title": "Implications of Internet architecture on net neutrality", "citations": [{"Name": "Marshini Chetty ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "David Haslem ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andrew Baird ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ugochi Ofoha ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bethany Sumner ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rebecca Grinter", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Joe Touch ", "Country": "jordan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ilia Baldine ", "Country": "jordan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rudra Dutta ", "Country": "jordan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gregory G.

But when deciding whether to disclose their personal information to Internet businesses, consumers may weigh the concerns of giving up information privacy against the benefits of information disclosure. This article examines how Internet businesses can motivate consumers to disclose their personal information. Based on a synthesis of the literature, the article identifies seven types of extrinsic or intrinsic benefits that Internet businesses can provide when soliciting personal information from consumers. Through comprehensive conceptual and empirical validation processes, the article develops an instrument that allows Internet businesses to gauge the preference of consumers for the various types of benefits. By testing a set of nomological networks, some ideas are presented to Internet businesses about what types of benefits may be more effective given the personality traits of particular consumer populations. Besides providing a foundation for efforts aimed at developing theories on information, privacy and information disclosure, the results of this research provide useful suggestions to Internet businesses on how best to solicit personal information from consumers. Implications for research and practical application are discussed.", "authors": [{"name": "kai-lung hui", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81501686185"}, {"name": "bernard c y tan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100255785"}, {"name": "chyan-yee goh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81320490035"}], "title": "Online information disclosure: Motivators and measurements", "citations": [{"Name": "Alfred Kobsa ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ramnath K.

Specifically, anEarliest Closest Firstheuristic algorithm is proposed that uses neurofuzzy techniques to predict the expected closing prices of the auctions and to adapt the agent's bidding strategy to reflect the type of environment in which it is situated. This algorithm first identifies the set of auctions that are most likely to give the agent the best return and then, according to its attitude to risk, it bids in some other auctions that have approximately similar expected returns, but which finish earlier than those in the best return set. We show through empirical evaluation against a number of methods proposed in the multiple auction literature that our bidding strategy performs effectively and robustly in a wide range of scenarios.", "authors": [{"name": "minghua he", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100331147"}, {"name": "nicholas r jennings", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100581072"}, {"name": "adam prugel-bennett", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100499762"}], "title": "A heuristic bidding strategy for buying multiple goods in multiple english auctions", "citations": [{"Name": "Bing Shi ", "Country": "peru", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Enrico H.

Many of these Web users utilize automated agents to gather this information for them. Some assume that this approach represents a more sophisticated method of searching. However, there is little research investigating how Web agents search for online information. In this research, we first provide a classification for information agent using stages of information gathering, gathering approaches, and agent architecture. We then examine an implementation of one of the resulting classifications in detail, investigating how agents search for information on Web search engines, including the session, query, term, duration and frequency of interactions. For this temporal study, we analyzed three data sets of queries and page views from agents interacting with the Excite and AltaVista search engines from 1997 to 2002, examining approximately 900,000 queries submitted by over 3,000 agents. Findings include: (1) agent sessions are extremely interactive, with sometimes hundreds of interactions per second (2) agent queries are comparable to human searchers, with little use of query operators, (3) Web agents are searching for a relatively limited variety of information, wherein only 18&percnt; of the terms used are unique, and (4) the duration of agent-Web search engine interaction typically spans several hours. We discuss the implications for Web information agents and search engines.", "authors": [{"name": "bernard j jansen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100141790"}, {"name": "tracy mullen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100472128"}, {"name": "amanda spink", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100385448"}, {"name": "jan pedersen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100100180"}], "title": "Automated gathering of Web information: An in-depth examination of agents interacting with search engines", "citations": [{"Name": "Omer Duskin ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dror G.

Leaving the burden of location/context management to applications complicates service design and development. In addition, traditional middleware solutions tend to hide location/context visibility to the application level and are not suitable for supporting novel adaptive services for mobile computing scenarios. The article proposes a flexible middleware for the development and deployment of location/context-aware services for heterogeneous data access in the Internet. A primary design choice is to exploit a high-level policy framework to simplify the specification of services that the middleware dynamically adapts to the client location/context. In addition, the middleware adopts the mobile agent technology to effectively support autonomous, asynchronous, and local access to data resources, and is particularly suitable for temporarily disconnected clients. The article also presents the case study of a museum guide assistant service that provides visitors with location/context-dependent artistic data. The case study points out the flexibility and usability of the proposed middleware that permits automatic service reconfiguration with no impact on the implementation of the application logic.", "authors": [{"name": "paolo bellavista", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100101755"}, {"name": "antonio corradi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100619373"}, {"name": "rebecca montanari", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100530254"}, {"name": "cesare stefanelli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100550748"}], "title": "A mobile computing middleware for location- and context-aware internet data services", "citations": [{"Name": "Vedran Podobnik ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ignac Lovrek", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ricardo Couto A. da Rocha ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ricardo Couto A. da Rocha ", "Country": "belgium", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "R.

For a particular parameterization, namely, a linear combination of the page ranks produced by different forcing functions, and user requirements represented by a set of linear constraints, the problem can be solved using a quadratic programming method. The solution to this problem produces a set of parameters which can be used for ranking all pages in the Web.

This makes it difficult for many to use their native language to name and access their Internet hosts. The IETF IDN (Internationalized Domain Name) Working Group proposes a mechanism, IDNA (Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications), for internationalized access to multilingual domain names. The proposal uses a preparation process that converts a Unicode IDN into an ACE (ASCII Compatible Encoding) string that uses only LDH. Thus, applications can look up the ACE string by using the existing DNS infrastructure. However, some of the domain name strings embedded in multilingual content do not have any charset tag so they cannot appropriately be converted into ACE strings. We noticed that many Internet applications allow users to use non-ASCII domain names. We were motivated to design an architecture for IDN resolution as well as to minimize the cost of modifying legacy Internet applications. We specifically focus on designing an IDN server proxy, which is located on the domain name server side, to handle domain names in multiple encodings. In this article, we study several architecture design issues including detection of charset encoding, routing of non-ACE IDN lookup requests, and so on.With respect to these design issues, we present an IDN server proxy architecture which stores ACE IDNs in domain name servers. Note that traditional domain name servers can be used without modification. An IDN server proxy, called Octopus, is employed on the domain name server side. Octopus converts a non-ACE IDN string into ACE upon receiving an IDN lookup request from remote users or autonomous systems. The ACE string is then forwarded to backend domain name servers (where the traditional domain names and ACE IDNs are stored) for further processing. This allows Internet users to access IDNs without having to upgrade their software.Based on the design and implementation of Octopus, we deployed a CDN (Chinese domain name) trial in July 2002. In this article, we present the results of testing Octopus IDN lookup functions as well as our experiences in providing CDN Web services. Several types of errors can occur if applications are unable to handle IDNs adequately. For example, a Web browser may erroneously parse an IDN within a URL. Many legacy Web servers are unable to process the IDN of a virtual host. Web application servers may have trouble completing some actions such as redirecting Web pages to alternative Web pages. Our studies help service providers understand potential problems when non-ASCII domain names are used and the best common practice at this stage. As well, the experiences give some guidance for software developers to develop IDNA-compliant Internet applications.", "authors": [{"name": "jeng-wei lin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81385599584"}, {"name": "jan-ming ho", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100317452"}, {"name": "li-ming tseng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100582436"}, {"name": "feipei lai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100543878"}], "title": "IDN server proxy architecture for Internationalized Domain Name resolution and experiences with providing Web services", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "12\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "675\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "taiwan", "university": "tunghai university", "affiliation_string": "tunghai university taichung taiwan", "city": "taizhong", "Name": "jeng-wei lin"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "academia sinica taipei taiwan", "city": null, "Name": "jan-ming ho"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "national central university", "affiliation_string": "national central university taoyuan county taiwan", "city": "taoyuan", "Name": "li-ming tseng"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "national taiwan university", "affiliation_string": "national taiwan university taipei taiwan", "city": "taibei", "Name": "feipei lai"}]}, "Pages: 20-52": {"references": ["Tarek F.

Various external factors are considered, including WAN delays and losses and different client behavior models. We find that performance can be dramatically improved via a kernel-level modification to the web server to change the scheduling policy at the server from the standard FAIR (processor-sharing) scheduling to SRPT (shortest-remaining-processing-time) scheduling. We find that SRPT scheduling induces no penalties. In particular, throughput is not sacrificed and requests for long files experience only negligibly higher response times under SRPT than they did under the original FAIR scheduling.", "authors": [{"name": "bianca schroeder", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100252395"}, {"name": "mor harchol-balter", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100215224"}], "title": "Web servers under overload: How scheduling can help", "citations": [{"Name": "Gra\u017cyna Suchacka ", "Country": "poland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Leszek Borzemski", "Country": "poland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "A research study on business-oriented quality-driven request service in a B2C web site", "Country": "poland", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Stavros Papastavrou ", "Country": "cyprus", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Panos K.

Recently, there has been much work on supporting complex queries on XML data (e.g., regular path expressions, structural projections, etc.). In this article, we examine the problem of implementing efficiently such complex queries on multiversion XML documents. Our approach relies on a numbering scheme, whereby durable node numbers (DNNs) are used to preserve the order among the nodes of the XML tree while remaining invariant with respect to updates. Using the document's DNNs, we show that many complex queries are reduced to combinations ofrange version retrievalqueries. We thus examine three alternative storage organizations/indexing schemes to efficiently evaluate range version retrieval queries in this environment. A thorough performance analysis is then presented to reveal the advantages of each scheme.", "authors": [{"name": "shu-yao chien", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100321746"}, {"name": "vassilis j tsotras", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100377324"}, {"name": "carlo zaniolo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100417054"}, {"name": "donghui zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81300354601"}], "title": "Supporting complex queries on multiversion XML documents", "citations": [{"Name": "Mirella M.

This article studiessemantic caching, a caching architecture for such applications, that caches the results of selection queries. The primary contribution of this article is to revisit the performance and overhead of semantic caching using a modern database server and modern hardware. Initially, the performance study focuses on simple workloads and demonstrates several benefits of semantic caching, including low overhead, insensitivity to the physical layout of the database, reduced network traffic, and the ability to answer some queries without contacting the server. With moderately complex workloads, careful coding of remainder queries is required to maintain efficient query processing at the server. Using very complex workloads, we demonstrate that semantic caching works well in a range of applications, especially in network-constrained environments.", "authors": [{"name": "bjorn or jonsson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452616062"}, {"name": "maria arinbjarnar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81317487759"}, {"name": "bjarnsteinn orsson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81317489297"}, {"name": "michael j franklin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452614168"}, {"name": "divesh srivastava", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100062835"}], "title": "Performance and overhead of semantic cache management", "citations": [{"Name": "Norvald H.

Instead of having moderators check the packages at upload time, illegal content is removed and its uploader's access to the network permanently revoked only when the violation is discovered. Other protective measures defend the GDN against internal and external attacks to its availability.

Since XML data is irregular and verbose, the disk space and the network bandwidth are wasted. To overcome the verbosity problem, research on compressors for XML data has been conducted. Some XML compressors do not support querying compressed data, while other XML compressors which support querying compressed data blindly encode tags and data values using predefined encoding methods. Existing XML compressors do not provide the facility for updates on compressed XML data.In this article, we propose XPRESS, an XML compressor which supports direct updates and efficient evaluations of queries on compressed XML data. XPRESS adopts a novel encoding method calledreverse arithmetic encoding, which encodes label paths of XML data and applies diverse encoding methods depending on the types of data values. Experimental results with real-life data sets show that XPRESS achieves significant improvements on query performance for compressed XML data and reasonable compression ratios. On average, the query performance of XPRESS is 2.13 times better than that of an existing XML compressor, and the compression ratio of XPRESS is about 71&percnt;. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficiency of the updates performed directly on compressed XML data.", "authors": [{"name": "jun-ki min", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100236294"}, {"name": "myung-jae park", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100157840"}, {"name": "chin-wan chung", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351596608"}], "title": "A compressor for effective archiving, retrieval, and updating of XML documents", "citations": [{"Name": "Andrei Arion ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Angela Bonifati ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ioana Manolescu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andrea Pugliese", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "11\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "799\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "korea south", "university": "korea university", "affiliation_string": "korea university of technology and education chungnam korea", "city": "soul", "Name": "jun-ki min"}, {"country": "austria", "university": "institute of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "korea advanced institute of science and technology daejeon korea", "city": "klosterneuburg", "Name": "myung-jae park"}, {"country": "austria", "university": "institute of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "korea advanced institute of science and technology daejeon korea", "city": "klosterneuburg", "Name": "chin-wan chung"}]}}, "date": {"month": "August", "year": "2006"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Pages: 153-186": {"references": ["T.

The advantage for the researchers is that they need not all crawl the Web before beginning their research.

These models may be used for a multitude of tasks including forensic analyses and detection tasks of value to law enforcement and intelligence agencies, as well for as other typical tasks such as virus and spam detection. To demonstrate the power of the methods, we focus on the application of these models to detect the early onset of a viral propagation without \u201ccontent-base \u201d (or signature-based) analysis in common use in virus scanners. We present several experiments using real email from 15 users with injected simulated viral emails and describe how the combination of different behavior models improves overall detection rates. The performance results vary depending upon parameter settings, approaching 99 &percnt; true positive (TP) (percentage of viral emails caught) in general cases and with 0.38 &percnt; false positive (FP) (percentage of emails with attachments that are mislabeled as viral). The models used for this study are based upon volume and velocity statistics of a user's email rate and an analysis of the user's (social)cliquesrevealed in the person's email behavior. We show by way of simulation that virus propagations are detectable since viruses may emit emails at rates different than human behavior suggests is normal, and email is directed to groups of recipients in ways that violate the users' typical communications with their social groups.", "authors": [{"name": "salvatore j stolfo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100583572"}, {"name": "shlomo hershkop", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100151506"}, {"name": "chia-wei hu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81316489031"}, {"name": "wei-jen li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81316489560"}, {"name": "olivier nimeskern", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81316490155"}, {"name": "ke wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350574174"}], "title": "Behavior-based modeling and its application to Email analysis", "citations": [{"Name": "Giuseppe Carenini ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Raymond T.

These models are based on the notion of preferential attachment, leading to the \u201crich get richer\u201d phenomenon. We present a generalization of the basic model by allowing deletion of individual links and show that it also gives rise to a power-law distribution. We derive the mean-field equations for this stochastic model and show that, by examining a snapshot of the distribution at the steady state of the model, we are able to determine the extent to which link deletion has taken place and estimate the probability of deleting a link. Applying our model to actual Web graph data provides evidence of the extent to which link deletion has occurred. We also discuss a problem that frequently arises in estimating the power-law exponent from empirical data and a few possible methods for dealing with this, indicating our preferred approach. Using this approach our analysis of the data suggests a power-law exponent of approximately 2.15 for the distribution of inlinks in the Web graph, rather than the widely published value of 2.1.", "authors": [{"name": "trevor fenner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100095421"}, {"name": "mark levene", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100320696"}, {"name": "george loizou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81337491440"}], "title": "A stochastic model for the evolution of the Web allowing link deletion", "citations": [{"Name": "Trevor Fenner ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mark Levene ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "George Loizou ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "George Roussos", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "A stochastic evolutionary growth model for social networks", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Judit Bar-Ilan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bluma C.

Prior work has proposed using the interaction between these DNS resolvers and the authoritative servers as an access control mechanism. However, while prior work has examined the DNS from many angles, the resolver component has received little scrutiny. Essential factors for using a resolver in an access control system, such as whether a resolver is part of an ISP\u2019s infrastructure or running on an end-user\u2019s system, have not been examined. In this study, we examine DNS resolver behavior and usage, from query patterns and reactions to nonstandard responses to passive association techniques to pair resolvers with their client hosts. In doing so, we discover evidence of security protocol support, misconfigured resolvers, techniques to fingerprint resolvers, and features for detecting automated clients. These measurements can influence the implementation and design of these resolvers and DNS-based access control systems.", "authors": [{"name": "craig a shue", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350591966"}, {"name": "andrew j kalafut", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319494293"}], "title": "Resolvers Revealed: Characterizing DNS Resolvers and their Clients", "citations": [{"Name": "Marc Green ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Douglas C.

It is useful in many application and commercialization scenarios. However, the existing product image search on e-commerce Web sites or general search engines usually get insufficient search results or return images that are redundant and not relevant enough. In this article, we present a novel product visualization approach that automatically collects a set of diverse and relevant product images by exploring multiple Web sources. Our approach simultaneously leverages Amazon and Google image search engines, which represent domain-specific knowledge resource and general Web information collection, respectively. We propose a conditional clustering approach that is formulated as an affinity propagation problem regarding the Amazon examples as information prior. The ranking information of Google image search results is also explored. In this way, a set of exemplars can be found from the Google search results and they are provided together with the Amazon example images for product visualization. Experiments demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.", "authors": [{"name": "meng wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351595589"}, {"name": "guangda li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82459190357"}, {"name": "zheng lu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81551185656"}, {"name": "yue gao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82458675157"}, {"name": "tat-seng chua", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100547902"}], "title": "When Amazon Meets Google: Product Visualization by Exploring Multiple Web Sources", "citations": [{"Name": "Chenggang Clarence Yan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hongtao Xie ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bing Zhang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yanping Ma ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Qiong Dai ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yizhi Liu", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fast approximate matching of binary codes with distinctive bits", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Changqin Quan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fuji Ren", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Unsupervised product feature extraction for feature-oriented opinion determination", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "71\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "471\n", "Citation Count": "5\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "china", "university": "hefei university of technology", "affiliation_string": "hefei university of technology", "city": "hefei", "Name": "meng wang"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": "national university of singapore", "affiliation_string": "national university of singapore", "city": "singapore", "Name": "guangda li"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": "national university of singapore", "affiliation_string": "national university of singapore", "city": "singapore", "Name": "zheng lu"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": "national university of singapore", "affiliation_string": "national university of singapore", "city": "singapore", "Name": "yue gao"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": "national university of singapore", "affiliation_string": "national university of singapore", "city": "singapore", "Name": "tat-seng chua"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["Otman Basir , Xiaohong Yuan, Engine fault diagnosis based on multi-sensor information fusion using Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, Information Fusion, v.8 n.4, p.379-386, October, 2007[doi>10.1016/j.inffus.2005.07.003]\n", "Isabelle Bloch, Some aspects of Dempster-Shafer evidence theory for classification of multi-modality medical images taking partial volume effect into account, Pattern Recognition Letters, v.17 n.8, p.905-919, July 1, 1996[doi>10.1016/0167-8655(96)00039-6]\n", "Blurrypeople. 2010.

A key problem encountered in such systems is the presence of flashers and obscene content. This problem is especially acute given the presence of underage minors in such systems. This article presents SafeVchat, a novel solution to the problem of flasher detection that employs an array of image detection algorithms. A key contribution of the article concerns how the results of the individual detectors are fused together into an overall decision classifying a user as misbehaving or not, based on Dempster-Shafer theory. The article introduces a novel, motion-based skin detection method that achieves significantly higher recall and better precision. The proposed methods have been evaluated over real-world data and image traces obtained from Chatroulette.com. SafeVchat has been deployed in Chatroulette. A combination of SafeVchat with human moderation has resulted in banning as many as 50,000 inappropriate users per day on Chatoulette. Furthermore, offensive content on Chatoulette has dropped significantly from 33.08&percnt; (before SafeVchat installation) to 3.49&percnt; (after SafeVchat installation).", "authors": [{"name": "yu-li liang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81482652141"}, {"name": "xinyu xing", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332536923"}, {"name": "hanqiang cheng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82458987957"}, {"name": "jianxun dang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81482649048"}, {"name": "sui huang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82459247357"}, {"name": "richard han", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82459029557"}, {"name": "xue liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82459258957"}, {"name": "qin lv", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100512601"}, {"name": "shivakant mishra", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81408594222"}], "title": "SafeVchat: A System for Obscene Content Detection in Online Video Chat Services", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "64\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "295\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado boulder", "city": null, "Name": "yu-li liang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado boulder", "city": null, "Name": "xinyu xing"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "mcgill university", "affiliation_string": "mcgill university", "city": "montreal", "Name": "hanqiang cheng"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "mcgill university", "affiliation_string": "mcgill university", "city": "montreal", "Name": "jianxun dang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ohio state university", "city": null, "Name": "sui huang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado boulder", "city": null, "Name": "richard han"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "mcgill university", "affiliation_string": "mcgill university", "city": "montreal", "Name": "xue liu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado boulder", "city": null, "Name": "qin lv"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of colorado boulder", "city": null, "Name": "shivakant mishra"}]}}, "date": {"month": "July", "year": "2013"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["S.

Among existing fixed-degree interconnection networks, the Kautz digraph has many distinctive topological properties compared to others. It, however, requires that the number of peers have the some given values, determined by peer degree and network diameter. In practice, we cannot guarantee how many peers will join a P2P network at a given time, since a P2P network is typically dynamic with peers frequently entering and leaving. To address such an issue, we propose the balanced Kautz tree and Kautz ring structures. We further design a novel structured P2P system, called BAKE, based on the two structures that has the logarithmical diameter and constant degree, even the number of peers is an arbitrary value. By keeping a total ordering of peers and employing a robust locality-preserved resource placement strategy, resources that are similar in a single or multidimensional attributes space are stored on the same peer or neighboring peers. Through analysis and simulation, we show that BAKE achieves the optimal diameter and as good a connectivity as the Kautz digraph does (almost achieves the Moore bound), and supports the exact as well as the range queries efficiently. Indeed, the structures of balanced Kautz tree and Kautz ring we propose can also be applied to other interconnection networks after minimal modifications, for example, the de Bruijn digraph.", "authors": [{"name": "deke guo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453608653"}, {"name": "yunhao liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81371594524"}, {"name": "hai jin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100055098"}, {"name": "zhong liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100529156"}, {"name": "weiming zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452602314"}, {"name": "hui liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442609882"}], "title": "Theory and network applications of balanced kautz tree structures", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "20\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "256\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "philippines", "university": "national university", "affiliation_string": "national university of defense technology china", "city": "manila", "Name": "deke guo"}, {"country": "china", "university": "tsinghua university", "affiliation_string": "tsinghua university china", "city": "peking", "Name": "yunhao liu"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "huazhong university of science and technology china", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "hai jin"}, {"country": "philippines", "university": "national university", "affiliation_string": "national university of defense technology china", "city": "manila", "Name": "zhong liu"}, {"country": "philippines", "university": "national university", "affiliation_string": "national university of defense technology china", "city": "manila", "Name": "weiming zhang"}, {"country": "china", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "xidian university china", "city": null, "Name": "hui liu"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Rakesh Agrawal , Anastasia Ailamaki , Philip A.

In this article we investigate the problem of supporting keyword-based searching for the discovery of software files that are installed on the nodes of large-scale, federated Grid and Cloud computing infrastructures. We address a number of challenges that arise from the unstructured nature of software and the unavailability of software-related metadata on large-scale networked environments. We present Minersoft, a harvester that visits Grid/Cloud infrastructures, crawls their file systems, identifies and classifies software files, and discovers implicit associations between them. The results of Minersoft harvesting are encoded in a weighted, typed graph, called the Software Graph. A number of information retrieval (IR) algorithms are used to enrich this graph with structural and content associations, to annotate software files with keywords and build inverted indexes to support keyword-based searching for software. Using a real testbed, we present an evaluation study of our approach, using data extracted from production-quality Grid and Cloud computing infrastructures. Experimental results show that Minersoft is a powerful tool for software search and discovery.", "authors": [{"name": "marios d dikaiakos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100624378"}, {"name": "asterios katsifodimos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81440618144"}, {"name": "george pallis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309487517"}], "title": "Minersoft: Software retrieval in grid and cloud computing infrastructures", "citations": [{"Name": "Andreas Papadopoulos ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "George Pallis ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marios D.

However, their inherent security weaknesses allow attacks against the integrity of Web sessions. HTTPS is often recommended to protect cookies, but deploying full HTTPS support can be challenging due to performance and financial concerns, especially for highly distributed applications. Moreover, cookies can be exposed in a variety of ways even when HTTPS is enabled. In this article, we proposeone-time cookies(OTC), a more robust alternative for session authentication. OTC prevents attacks such as session hijacking by signing each user request with a session secret securely stored in the browser. Unlike other proposed solutions, OTC does not require expensive state synchronization in the Web application, making it easily deployable in highly distributed systems. We implemented OTC as a plug-in for the popular WordPress platform and as an extension for Firefox and Firefox for mobile browsers. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that OTC introduces a latency of less than 6 ms when compared to cookies\u2014a negligible overhead for most Web applications. Moreover, we show that OTC can be combined with HTTPS to effectively add another layer of security to Web applications. In so doing, we demonstrate that one-time cookies can significantly improve the security of Web applications with minimal impact on performance and scalability.", "authors": [{"name": "italo dacosta", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375619694"}, {"name": "saurabh chakradeo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81503694762"}, {"name": "mustaque ahamad", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100442937"}, {"name": "patrick traynor", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309504558"}], "title": "One-time cookies: Preventing session hijacking attacks with stateless authentication tokens", "citations": [{"Name": "Philippe De Ryck ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lieven Desmet ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Frank Piessens ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wouter Joosen", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Olivier Levillain ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Baptiste Gourdin ", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Herv\u00e9 Debar", "Country": "singapore", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "M.

Today, over millions of transactions take place on the Internet. Although the widespread use of digital environments has generally provided opportunities for societies, a number of threats have limited their adoption. The de-facto standard today is for certification authorities to authenticate the identity of service providers while trust on the provided services is implied. This approach has certain shortcomings, for example, single point of failure, implied trust rather than explicit trust and others. One approach for minimizing such threats is to introduce an effective and resilient trust mechanism that is capable of determining the trustworthiness of service providers in providing their services. Determining the trustworthiness of services reduces invalid transactions in digital environments and further encourages collaborations. Evaluating trustworthiness of a service provider without any prior historical transactions (i.e. the initial transaction) pose a number of challenging issues. This article presents TIDE - a decentralized reputation trust mechanism that determines the initial trustworthiness of entities in digital environments. TIDE improves the precision of trust computation by considering raters\u2019 feedback, number of transactions, credibility, incentive to encourage raters\u2019 participation, strategy for updating raters\u2019 category, and safeguards against dynamic personalities. Furthermore, TIDE classifies raters into three categories and promotes the flexibility and customization through its parameters. Evaluation of TIDE against several attack vectors demonstrates its accuracy, robustness and resilience.", "authors": [{"name": "ilung pranata", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490665134"}, {"name": "rukshan athauda", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490643246"}, {"name": "geoff skinner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100245846"}], "title": "Modeling Decentralized Reputation-Based Trust for Initial Transactions in Digital Environments", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "49\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "289\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "australia", "university": "university of newcastle", "affiliation_string": "the university of newcastle australia", "city": "newcastle", "Name": "ilung pranata"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "university of newcastle", "affiliation_string": "the university of newcastle australia", "city": "newcastle", "Name": "rukshan athauda"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "university of newcastle", "affiliation_string": "the university of newcastle australia", "city": "newcastle", "Name": "geoff skinner"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Aiache, H., Haettel, F., Lebrun, L., and Tavernier, C. 2008.

We formally quantify the privacy exposure and the protection of our system in the presence of malicious neighboring peers, global WiFi eavesdroppers, and omniscient mobile network operators, which possibly collude to breach user\u2019s anonymity or disrupt the communication. We also describe how a micropayment scheme that suits our mobile scenario can provide incentives for peers to collaborate in the protocol.

We present an analytical model of DNS proxy operations that offers insights into the design trade-offs of DNS infrastructure and the selection of critical DNS parameters.Due to the critical role DNS proxies play in QoDNS, they are the focus of attacks including cache poisoning attack. We extend the analytical model to study DNS cache poisoning attacks and their impact on QoDNS metrics. This analytical study prompts us to present Domain Name Cross-Referencing (DoX), a peer-to-peer systems for DNS proxies to cooperatively defend cache poisoning attacks. Based on QoDNS, we compare DoX with the cryptography-based DNS Security Extension (DNSSEC) to understand their relative merits.", "authors": [{"name": "lihua yuan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435593373"}, {"name": "chao-chih chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83458627257"}, {"name": "prasant mohapatra", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100262895"}, {"name": "chen-nee chuah", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100478746"}, {"name": "krishna kant", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100057268"}], "title": "A Proxy View of Quality of Domain Name Service, Poisoning Attacks and Survival Strategies", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "71\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "304\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Trinidad and Tobago", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california davis", "city": "california", "Name": "lihua yuan"}, {"country": "Trinidad and Tobago", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california davis", "city": "california", "Name": "chao-chih chen"}, {"country": "Trinidad and Tobago", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california davis", "city": "california", "Name": "prasant mohapatra"}, {"country": "Trinidad and Tobago", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california davis", "city": "california", "Name": "chen-nee chuah"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "intel", "city": null, "Name": "krishna kant"}]}}, "date": {"month": "May", "year": "2013"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Andrei Arion , V\u00e9ronique Benzaken , Ioana Manolescu , Yannis Papakonstantinou, Structured materialized views for XML queries, Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases, September 23-27, 2007, Vienna, Austria\n", "Andrey Balmin , Fatma \u00d6zcan , Kevin S.

A delivery-centric abstraction allows applications to generate content requests agnostic to location or protocol, with the additional ability to stipulate high-level requirements regarding such things as performance, security, and resource consumption. Fulfilling these requirements, however, is complex as often the ability of a provider to satisfy requirements will vary between different consumers and over time. Therefore, we argue that it is vital to manage this variance to ensure an application fulfils its needs. To this end, we present theJunomiddleware, which implements delivery-centric support using a reconfigurable software architecture to: (i) discover multiple sources of an item of content; (ii) model each source\u2019s ability to provide the content; then (iii) adapt to interact with the source(s) that can best fulfil the application\u2019s requirements. Juno therefore utilizes existing providers in a backwards compatible way, supporting immediate deployment.

We consider a setting in which complementary-valued items are offered sequentially by different sellers, who have the choice of either selling their item directly or through a priced option. In our model, the seller fixes the exercise price for this option, and then sells it through a first-price auction. We analyze this model from a decision-theoretic perspective and we show, for a setting where the competition is formed by local bidders (which desire a single item), that using options can increase the expected profit for both sides. Furthermore, we derive the equations that provide minimum and maximum bounds between which the bids of the synergy buyer are expected to fall, in order for both sides of the market to have an incentive to use the options mechanism. Next, we perform an experimental analysis of a market in which multiple synergy buyers are active simultaneously. We show that, despite the extra competition, some synergy buyers may benefit, because sellers are forced to set their exercise prices for options at levels which encourage participation of all buyers.", "authors": [{"name": "valentin robu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100443941"}, {"name": "lonneke mous", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81365597682"}, {"name": "han la poutre", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100620179"}], "title": "Using Priced Options to Solve the Exposure Problem in Sequential Auctions", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "21\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "169\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Haiti", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cwi centre for mathematics and computer science amsterdam the netherlands", "city": "centre", "Name": "valentin robu"}, {"country": "Haiti", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cwi centre for mathematics and computer science amsterdam the netherlands", "city": "centre", "Name": "lonneke mous"}, {"country": "Haiti", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cwi centre for mathematics and computer science amsterdam the netherlands", "city": "centre", "Name": "han la poutre"}]}}, "date": {"month": "December", "year": "2012"}}}, "Volume13": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Sihem Amer Yahia , Michael Benedikt , Laks V.

Yet, performing effective search in these systems is very challenging, especially when we seek the most appropriate items that match a potentially ambiguous query. Collaborative filtering-based personalization is appealing in this context, as it limits the search within a small network of participants with similar preferences. Offline personalization, which consists in maintaining, for every user, a network of similar participants based on their tagging behaviors, is effective for queries that are close to the querying user\u2019s tagging profile but performs poorly when the queries, reflecting emerging interests, have little correlation with the querying user\u2019s profile.We present P2TK2, the first protocol to personalize query processing in social tagging systems online. P2TK2is completely decentralized, and this design choice stems from the observation that the evolving social tagging systems naturally resemble P2P systems where users are both producers and consumers. This design exploits the power of the crowd and prevents any central authority from controlling personal information. P2TK2is gossip-based and probabilistic. It dynamically associates each user with social acquaintances sharing similar tagging behaviors. Appropriate users for answering a query are discovered at query time with the help of social acquaintances. This is achieved according to thehybrid interestof the querying user, taking into account both her tagging behavior and her query. Results are iteratively refined and returned to the querying user. We evaluate P2TK2onCiteULikeandDelicioustraces involving up to 50,000 users. We highlight the advantages of online personalization compared to offline personalization, as well as its efficiency, scalability, and inherent ability to cope with user departure and interest evolution in P2P systems.", "authors": [{"name": "xiao bai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490646220"}, {"name": "rachid guerraoui", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100348136"}, {"name": "anne-marie kermarrec", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81556223556"}], "title": "Personalizing Top-k Processing Online in a Peer-to-Peer Social Tagging Network", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "82\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "11\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "186\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "xiao bai"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "rachid guerraouiecole polytechnique federale de lausanne"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "anne-marie kermarrec"}]}, "Article No.: 12": {"references": ["Sudhir Agarwal and Steffen Lamparter. 2005.

Data Web services composition has emerged as a flexible solution to answer users\u2019 complex queries on the fly. However, as the number of Web services on the Web grows quickly, a large number of candidate compositions that would use different (most likely competing) services may be used to answer the same query. User preferences are a key factor that can be used to rank candidate services/compositions and retain only the best ones. In this article, we present a novel approach for computing the top-kdata service compositions based on user preferences. In our approach, we model user preferences using fuzzy sets and incorporate them into the composition query. We use an efficient RDF query rewriting algorithm to determine the relevant services that may be used to answer the composition query. We match the (fuzzy) constraints of the relevant services to those of the query and determine their matching degrees using a set of matching methods. We then rank-order the candidate services based on a fuzzification of Pareto dominance and compute the top-kdata service compositions.

As a consequence, massive collections of multimedia objects are now widely available to a large population of users. As the task of browsing such large collections could be daunting,Recommender Systemsare being developed to assist users in finding items that match their needs and preferences. In this article, we present a novel approach to recommendation in multimedia browsing systems, based on modeling recommendation as a social choice problem. In social choice theory, a set of voters is called to rank a set of alternatives, and individual rankings are aggregated into a global ranking. In our formulation, the set of voters and the set of alternatives both coincide with the set of objects in the data collection. We first define what constitutes a choice in the browsing domain and then define a mechanism to aggregate individual choices into a global ranking. The result is a framework for computing customized recommendations by originally combining intrinsic features of multimedia objects, past behavior of individual users, and overall behavior of the entire community of users. Recommendations are ranked using an importance ranking algorithm that resembles the well-knownPageRankstrategy.

In our model, a user that wishes to access online content (offered by a website) does not need to register or pay to access the website; instead, he will accept to run microcomputations on behalf of the service provider in exchange for access to the content. These microcomputations can, for example, support ongoing computing projects that have clear social benefits (e.g., projects relating to medical research) or can contribute towards commercial computing projects. We analyze the security and privacy of our proposal and we show that it preserves the privacy of users. We argue that this micropayment model is economically and technically viable and that it can be integrated in existing distributed computing frameworks (e.g., the BOINC platform). In this respect, we implement a prototype of a system based on our model and we deploy our prototype on Amazon Mechanical Turk to evaluate its performance and usability given a large number of users. Our results show that our proposed scheme does not affect the browsing experience of users and is likely to be used by a non-trivial proportion of users. Finally, we empirically show that our scheme incurs comparable bandwidth and CPU consumption to the resource usage incurred by online advertisements featured in popular websites.", "authors": [{"name": "ghassan o karame", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81335492790"}, {"name": "aurelien francillon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310487427"}, {"name": "victor budilivschi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=89558618757"}, {"name": "srdjan capkun", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100396056"}, {"name": "vedran capkun", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=89558778757"}], "title": "Microcomputations as Micropayments in Web-based Services", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "76\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "199\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "ghassan o karame"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "aurelien francillon"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "eth zurich", "city": null, "Name": "victor budilivschi"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "eth zurich", "city": null, "Name": "srdjan capkun"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "hec paris", "city": null, "Name": "vedran capkun"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["M.

Some enterprises with existing IT infrastructure employ a hybrid cloud model where the enterprise uses its own private resources for the majority of its computing, but then \u201cbursts\u201d into the cloud when local resources are insufficient. However, current commercial tools rely heavily on the system administrator\u2019s knowledge to answer key questions such as when a cloud burst is needed and which applications must be moved to the cloud. In this article, we describe Seagull, a system designed to facilitate cloud bursting by determining which applications should be transitioned into the cloud and automating the movement process at the proper time. Seagull optimizes the bursting of applications using an optimization algorithm as well as a more efficient but approximate greedy heuristic. Seagull also optimizes the overhead of deploying applications into the cloud using an intelligent precopying mechanism that proactively replicates virtualized applications, lowering the bursting time from hours to minutes. Our evaluation shows over 100&percnt; improvement compared to na\u00efve solutions but produces more expensive solutions compared to ILP. However, the scalability of our greedy algorithm is dramatically better as the number of VMs increase. Our evaluation illustrates scenarios where our prototype can reduce cloud costs by more than 45&percnt; when bursting to the cloud, and that the incremental cost added by precopying applications is offset by a burst time reduction of nearly 95&percnt;.", "authors": [{"name": "tian guo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=86158633857"}, {"name": "upendra sharma", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100235836"}, {"name": "prashant shenoy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100334109"}, {"name": "timothy wood", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100373372"}, {"name": "sambit sahu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100188072"}], "title": "Cost-Aware Cloud Bursting for Enterprise Applications", "citations": [{"Name": "Zhihui Lu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jie Wu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jie Bao ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Patrick C.

However, most businesses today have item ontologies that provide a useful source of content descriptors that can be used to enhance the quality of recommendations generated. In this article, we present a novel approach to integrating user rating vectors with an item ontology to generate recommendations. The approach is novel in measuring similarity between users in that it first derives factors, referred to asimpacts, driving the observed user behavior and then uses these factors within the similarity computation. In doing so, a more comprehensive user model is learned that is sensitive to the context of the user visit.An evaluation of our recommendation algorithm was carried out using data from an online retailer of movies with over 94,000 movies, 44,000 actors, and 10,000 directors within the item knowledge base. The evaluation showed a statistically significant improvement in the prediction accuracy over traditional collaborative filtering. Additionally, the algorithm was shown to generate recommendations for visitors that belong to sparse sections of the user space, areas where traditional collaborative filtering would generally fail to generate accurate recommendations.", "authors": [{"name": "sarabjot singh anand", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100232025"}, {"name": "patricia kearney", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81541895456"}, {"name": "mary shapcott", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100162669"}], "title": "Generating semantically enriched user profiles for Web personalization", "citations": [{"Name": "Ahmad Hawalah ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Maria Fasli", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dynamic user profiles for web personalisation", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tao Li ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sarabjot Singh Anand", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marco de Gemmis ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tommaso Di Noia ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ora Lassila ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Pasquale Lops ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Thomas Lukasiewicz ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Giovanni Semeraro", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Antonio M.

We present a new approach to mining a user's preferences on the search results from clickthrough data and using the discovered preferences to adapt the search engine's ranking function for improving search quality. We develop a new preference mining technique calledSpyNB, which is based on the practical assumption that the search results clicked on by the user reflect the user's preferences but does not draw any conclusions about the results that the user did not click on. As such, SpyNB is still valid even if the user does not follow any order in reading the search results or does not click on all relevant results. Our extensive offline experiments demonstrate that SpyNB discovers many more accurate preferences than existing algorithms do. The interactive online experiments further confirm that SpyNB and our personalization approach are effective in practice. We also show that the efficiency of SpyNB is comparable to existing simple preference mining algorithms.", "authors": [{"name": "wilfred ng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81423593726"}, {"name": "lin deng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81338488235"}, {"name": "dik lun lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81385591271"}], "title": "Mining User preference using Spy voting for search engine personalization", "citations": [{"Name": "Jidong Chen ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hang Guo ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wentao Wu ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wei Wang", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dingqi Yang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daqing Zhang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zhiyong Yu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zhiwen Yu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Djamal Zeghlache", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "34\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "892\n", "Citation Count": "7\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "the hong kong university of science and technology kowloon hong kong", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "wilfred ng"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "the hong kong university of science and technology kowloon hong kong", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "lin deng"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "the hong kong university of science and technology kowloon hong kong", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "dik lun lee"}]}, "Article No.: 23": {"references": ["Albert, M. and Aha, D. 1991.

Attackers, who cannot be readily distinguished from ordinary users, may inject biased profiles in an attempt to force a system to \u201cadapt\u201d in a manner advantageous to them. Such attacks may lead to a degradation of user trust in the objectivity and accuracy of the system. Recent research has begun to examine the vulnerabilities and robustness of different collaborative recommendation techniques in the face of \u201cprofile injection\u201d attacks. In this article, we outline some of the major issues in building secure recommender systems, concentrating in particular on the modeling of attacks and their impact on various recommendation algorithms. We introduce several new attack models and perform extensive simulation-based evaluations to show which attacks are most successful and practical against common recommendation techniques. Our study shows that both user-based and item-based algorithms are highly vulnerable to specific attack models, but that hybrid algorithms may provide a higher degree of robustness. Using our formal characterization of attack models, we also introduce a novel classification-based approach for detecting attack profiles and evaluate its effectiveness in neutralizing attacks.", "authors": [{"name": "bamshad mobasher", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100172561"}, {"name": "robin burke", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100241179"}, {"name": "runa bhaumik", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309484424"}, {"name": "chad williams", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309513243"}], "title": "Toward trustworthy recommender systems: An analysis of attack models and algorithm robustness", "citations": [{"Name": "Assad Abbas ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Limin Zhang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Samee U.

The need for predicting the users' needs in order to improve the usability and user retention of a Web site is more than evident and can be addressed by personalizing it. Recommendation algorithms aim at proposing \u201cnext\u201d pages to users based on their current visit and past users' navigational patterns. In the vast majority of related algorithms, however, only the usage data is used to produce recommendations, disregarding the structural properties of the Web graph. Thus important\u2014in terms of PageRank authority score\u2014pages may be underrated. In this work, we presentUPR, a PageRank-style algorithm which combines usage data and link analysis techniques for assigning probabilities to Web pages based on their importance in the Web site's navigational graph. We propose the application of a localized version ofUPR(l-UPR) to personalized navigational subgraphs for online Web page ranking and recommendation. Moreover, we propose a hybrid probabilistic predictive model based on Markov models and link analysis for assigning prior probabilities in a hybrid probabilistic model. We prove, through experimentation, that this approach results in more objective and representative predictions than the ones produced from the pure usage-based approaches.", "authors": [{"name": "magdalini eirinaki", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100185742"}, {"name": "michalis vazirgiannis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100414295"}], "title": "Web site personalization based on link analysis and navigational patterns", "citations": [{"Name": "E.

This architecture includes an application tier to process requests for dynamically generated content. How this tier is provisioned can significantly impact a provider's profit margin. In this article we study methods to provision servers in the application serving tier that increase a server provider's profits. First, we examine actual traces of request arrivals to the application tier of an e-commerce site, and show that the arrival process is effectively Poisson. Next, we construct an optimization problem in the context of a set of application servers modeled asM/G/1/PSqueueing systems, and derive three simple methods that approximate the allocation that maximizes profits. Simulation results demonstrate that our approximation methods achieve profits that are close to optimal, and are significantly higher than those achieved via simple heuristics.", "authors": [{"name": "daniel villela", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100025921"}, {"name": "prashant pradhan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81545865956"}, {"name": "dan rubenstein", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100624099"}], "title": "Provisioning servers in the application tier for e-commerce systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Waheed Iqbal ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Matthew N.

This article illustrates a conceptual framework that provides modeling facilities for context-aware, multichannel Web applications; it also shows how high-level modeling constructs can drive the application development process through automatic code generation. Our work stresses the importance of user-independent,context-triggeredadaptation actions, in which the context plays the role of a \u201cfirst class\u201dactor, operating independently of users on the same hypertext the users navigate. Modeling concepts are based on WebML (Web Modeling Language), an already established conceptual model for data-intensive Web applications, which is also accompanied by a development method and a CASE tool. However, given their general validity, the concepts of this article shape up a complete framework that can be adopted independently of the chosen model, method, and tool.", "authors": [{"name": "stefano ceri", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100606078"}, {"name": "florian daniel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314481931"}, {"name": "maristella matera", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81338489903"}, {"name": "federico m facca", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100590582"}], "title": "Model-driven development of context-aware Web applications", "citations": [{"Name": "Christoph Dorn ", "Country": "cyprus", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Richard N.

Such devices tend to have a feature in common: limited computational capabilities and equally limited power, as most operate on batteries. This makes them ill-suited for public key signatures. This article explores practical and conceptual implications of using Server-Aided Signatures (SAS) for these devices. SAS is a signature method that relies on partially-trusted servers for generating (normally expensive) public key signatures for regular users. Although the primary goal is to aid small, resource-limited devices in signature generation, SAS also offers fast certificate revocation, signature causality and reliable timestamping. It also has some interesting features such as built-in attack detection for users and DoS resistance for servers. Our experimental results also validate the feasibility of deploying SAS on smart devices.", "authors": [{"name": "xuhua ding", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100136248"}, {"name": "daniele mazzocchi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100344757"}, {"name": "gene tsudik", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100064107"}], "title": "Equipping smart devices with public key signatures", "citations": [{"Name": "Mohammad Hasan Samadani ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mehdi Shajari ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mehdi Ahaniha", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "A survey on mobile digital signature models", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ayan Roy-Chowdhury ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "John S.

Two kinds of features related to the text fragments from the Web documents are investigated. The first type of feature is called, a site-invariant feature. These features likely remain unchanged in Web pages from different sites in the same domain. The second type of feature is called a site-dependent feature. These features are different in the Web pages collected from different Web sites, while they are similar in the Web pages originating from the same site. In our framework, we derive the site-invariant features from previously learned extraction knowledge and the items previously collected or extracted from the source Web site. The derived site-invariant features will be exploited to automatically seek a new set of training examples in the new unseen target site. Both the site-dependent features and the site-invariant features of these automatically discovered training examples will be considered in the learning of new information extraction knowledge for the target site. We conducted extensive experiments on a set of real-world Web sites collected from three different domains to demonstrate the performance of our framework. For example, by just providing training examples from one online book catalog Web site, our approach can automatically extract information from ten different book catalog sites achieving an average precision and recall of 71.9&percnt; and 84.0&percnt; respectively without any further manual intervention.", "authors": [{"name": "tak-lam wong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81343508867"}, {"name": "wai lam", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81423592360"}], "title": "Adapting Web information extraction knowledge via mining site-invariant and site-dependent features", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "27\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "1556\n", "Citation Count": "5\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "city university", "affiliation_string": "city university of hong kong kowloon hong kong", "city": "london", "Name": "tak-lam wong"}, {"country": "hong kong", "university": "university of hong kong", "affiliation_string": "the chinese university of hong kong shatin hong kong", "city": "xianggangdao", "Name": "wai lam"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["James Abello , Panos M.

Our research shows that process codifiability plays a key role in determining output quality. Further, we show that the efforts made by the client and the provider in monitoring work via Internet-based monitoring mechanisms have a significant impact on output quality.

We show that prior to the Internet, domestic entrepreneurship was the key factor for the industry's origin and growth. The industry suffered from relatively low value-addition. As a result, domestic firms, though they were industry leaders within India, were followers of the global leadership provided by transnational firms. With the arrival of the Internet, there was a rise in the level of domain expertise. We show that the Internet facilitated the transfer of domain expertise for foreign firms more than it helped the acquisition of domain expertise by domestic firms. While the value-addition of the industry increased as a result, industry leadership began to pass to foreign firms. The strategic lesson for other countries trying to rapidly develop an export-oriented software industry is unambiguous: exclusive reliance on domestic entrepreneurship will usually result in the domestic industry falling behind its global competitors, while granting unrestricted entry to transnational firms will lead to the domestic firms losing industry leadership in most cases.", "authors": [{"name": "rafiq dossani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330490231"}, {"name": "nathan denny", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81336488515"}], "title": "The Internet's role in offshored services: A case study of India", "citations": [{"Name": "Jussi Kasurinen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ossi Taipale ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kari Smolander", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "38\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "1361\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "stanford university", "city": null, "Name": "rafiq dossani"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of arizona tucson az", "city": "arizona", "Name": "nathan denny"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Aron, R. and Singh, J. 2004.

White-collar professionals in the US, Australia, and Poland, for example, could each work on a standard 9--5 basis, transfer the activity to a colleague in the next center, thereby enabling work to be performed on a round-the-clock basis. The effective use of sequential workers in such a 24-hour knowledge factory requires that professional tasks be broken down to the level where individuals can work on them with minimal interaction with their peers, and where new approaches can be employed to reduce the effort involved in transitioning from one employee to the next. This article describes an Internet-based prototype system that uses a Web-based interactive approach, coupled with a unique data model, to optimize collection and storage of design rationale and history from stakeholders and workers. The idea of multiple individuals acting as one \u201ccomposite persona\u201d is explored in the context of facilitating tasks and knowledge to be shared across the Internet in a seamless manner.

There is an increasing need for organizations to share their data across organization boundaries both within the country and with countries that may have lesser privacy and security standards. Ideally, we wish to share certain statistical data and extract the knowledge from the private databases without revealing any additional information of each individual database apart from the aggregate result that is permitted. In this article, we describe two scenarios for outsourcing data aggregation services and present a set of decentralized peer-to-peer protocols for supporting data sharing across multiple private databases while minimizing the data disclosure among individual parties. Our basic protocols include a set of novel probabilistic computation mechanisms for important primitive data aggregation operations across multiple private databases such as max, min, and topkselection. We provide an analytical study of our basic protocols in terms of precision, efficiency, and privacy characteristics. Our advanced protocols implement an efficient algorithm for performingkNN classification across multiple private databases. We provide a set of experiments to evaluate the proposed protocols in terms of their correctness, efficiency, and privacy characteristics.", "authors": [{"name": "li xiong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452602581"}, {"name": "subramanyam chitti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100419855"}, {"name": "ling liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350573402"}], "title": "Preserving data privacy in outsourcing data aggregation services", "citations": [{"Name": "Aaron Steele ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Keith B.

The hypermedia paradigm provides a way of overlaying a set of resources with additional information in the form of links to help people find other resources. However, existing hypermedia approaches primarily develop mechanisms to enable resource sharing in a fairly static, centralized way. Recent developments in distributed computing, on the other hand, introduced peer-to-peer (P2P) computing that is notable for employing distributed resources to perform a critical function in a more dynamic and ad-hoc scenario. We investigate the feasibility and potential benefits of bringing together the P2P paradigm with the concept of hypermedia link services to implement ad-hoc resource sharing on the Web. This is accomplished by utilizing a web-based Distributed Dynamic Link Service (DDLS) as a testbed and addressing the issues arising from the design, implementation, and enhancement of the service. Our experimental result reveals the behavior and performance of the semantics-based resource discovery in DDLS and demonstrates that the proposed enhancing technique for DDLS, topology reorganization, is appropriate and efficient.", "authors": [{"name": "jing zhou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330500784"}, {"name": "wendy hall", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100158597"}, {"name": "david c de roure", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100497770"}, {"name": "vijay k dialani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100505893"}], "title": "Supporting ad-hoc resource sharing on the Web: A peer-to-peer approach to hypermedia link services", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "8\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "603\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "china", "university": "communication university of china", "affiliation_string": "communication university of china beijing china", "city": "peking", "Name": "jing zhou"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of southampton", "affiliation_string": "university of southampton southampton uk", "city": "southampton", "Name": "wendy hall"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of southampton", "affiliation_string": "university of southampton southampton uk", "city": "southampton", "Name": "david c de roure"}, {"country": "Paraguay", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm almaden research center san jose ca", "city": "san jose", "Name": "vijay k dialani"}]}, "Article No.: 8": {"references": ["Bartal, Y., Mayer, A., Nissim, K., and Wool, A. 1999.

Scalability and the capacity for distributed control have unfortunately not extended well to resource access-control policies and mechanisms. Yet management of security is becoming an increasingly challenging problem in no small part due to scaling up of measures such as number of users, protocols, applications, network elements, topological constraints, and functionality expectations.In this article, we discuss scalability challenges for traditional access-control mechanisms at the architectural level and present a set of fundamental requirements for authorization services in large-scale networks. We show why existing mechanisms fail to meet these requirements and investigate the current design options for a scalable access-control architecture.We argue that the key design options to achieve scalability are the choice of the representation of access control policy, the distribution mechanism for policy, and the choice of the access-rights revocation scheme. Although these ideas have been considered in the past, current access-control systems in use continue to use simpler but restrictive architectural models. With this article, we hope to influence the design of future access-control systems towards more decentralized and scalable mechanisms.", "authors": [{"name": "angelos d keromytis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100083417"}, {"name": "jonathan m smith", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81407594028"}], "title": "Requirements for scalable access control and security management architectures", "citations": [{"Name": "Ramon Francisco Pacquiao Mejia ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yuichi Kaji ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hiroyuki Seki", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andrew G.

In many applications, such as data exchange and data archiving, entirely compressing and decompressing a document is acceptable. In other applications, where queries must be run over compressed documents, compression may not be beneficial since the performance penalty in running the query processor over compressed data outweighs the data compression benefits. While balancing the interests of compression and query processing has received significant attention in the domain of relational databases, these results do not immediately translate to XML data.In this article, we address the problem of embedding compression into XML databases without degrading query performance. Since the setting is rather different from relational databases, the choice of compression granularity and compression algorithms must be revisited. Query execution in the compressed domain must also be rethought in the framework of XML query processing due to the richer structure of XML data. Indeed, a proper storage design for the compressed data plays a crucial role here.TheXQueCsystem (XQuery Processor andCompressor) covers a wide set of XQuery queries in the compressed domain and relies on a workload-based cost model to perform the choices of the compression granules and of their corresponding compression algorithms. As a consequence, XQueC provides efficient query processing on compressed XML data. An extensive experimental assessment is presented, showing the effectiveness of the cost model, the compression ratios, and the query execution times.", "authors": [{"name": "andrei arion", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100395993"}, {"name": "angela bonifati", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100571727"}, {"name": "ioana manolescu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100402995"}, {"name": "andrea pugliese", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100366308"}], "title": "XQueC: A query-conscious compressed XML database", "citations": [{"Name": "O'Neil Delpratt ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rajeev Raman ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Naila Rahman", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Engineering succinct DOM", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Stefan B\u00f6ttcher ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rita Hartel ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sebastian Stey", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nieves R.

Suchdiscrete bidauctions require that the bidders submit bids at predetermined discrete bid levels, and thus, there exists a minimal increment by which the bid price may be raised. In contrast, the academic literature of optimal auction design deals almost solely with continuous bid auctions. As a result, there is little practical guidance as to how an auctioneer, seeking to maximize its revenue, should determine the number and value of these discrete bid levels, and it is this omission that is addressed here. To this end, a model of an ascending price English auction with discrete bid levels is considered. An expression for the expected revenue of this auction is derived and used to determine numerical and analytical solutions for the optimal bid levels in the case of uniform and exponential bidder's valuation distributions. Finally, in order to develop an intuitive understanding of how these optimal bid levels are distributed, the limiting case where the number of discrete bid levels is large is considered, and an analytical expression for their distribution is derived.", "authors": [{"name": "esther david", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100044255"}, {"name": "alex rogers", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100174116"}, {"name": "nicholas r jennings", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100581072"}, {"name": "jeremy schiff", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330497828"}, {"name": "sarit kraus", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100585484"}, {"name": "michael h rothkopf", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100139826"}], "title": "Optimal design of english auctions with discrete bid levels", "citations": [{"Name": "Alex Rogers ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Esther David ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nicholas R.

In contrast to previous systems, SWORD allows users to describe desired resources as a topology of interconnected groups with required intragroup, intergroup, and per-node characteristics, along with the utility that the application derives from specified ranges of metric values. This design gives users the flexibility to find geographically distributed resources for applications that are sensitive to both node and network characteristics, and allows the system to rank acceptable configurations based on their quality for that application.Rather than evaluating a single implementation of SWORD, we explore a variety of architectural designs that deliver the required functionality in a scalable and highly available manner. We discuss the trade-offs of using a centralized architecture as compared to a fully decentralized design to perform wide-area resource discovery. To summarize our results, we found that a centralized architecture based on 4-node server cluster sites at network-peering facilities outperforms a decentralized DHT-based resource discovery infrastructure with respect to query latency for all but the smallest number of sites. However, although a centralized architecture shows significant promise in stable environments, we find that our decentralized implementation has acceptable performance and also benefits from the DHT's self-healing properties in more volatile environments. We evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of centralized and distributed resource discovery architectures on 1000 hosts in emulation and on approximately 200 PlanetLab nodes spread across the Internet.", "authors": [{"name": "jeannie albrecht", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100358372"}, {"name": "david oppenheimer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100365264"}, {"name": "amin vahdat", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100104394"}, {"name": "david a patterson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100565162"}], "title": "Design and implementation trade-offs for wide-area resource discovery", "citations": [{"Name": "Damia Castell\u00e0 ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hector Blanco ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Francesc Gin\u00e9 ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Francesc Solsona", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Combining Hilbert SFC and bruijn graphs for searching computing markets in a P2P system", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Raffaele Giordanelli ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Carlo Mastroianni ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michela Meo", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Panho Lee ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Anura P.

Studying mappings between different forms of semantics helps unveil the uniformity in the diversity. This article investigates the mappings between three typical semantic models: the Web ontology language (OWL), relational database model, and resource space model (a classification-based semantic model). By establishing mappings between the semantic primitives of the three models, we study the mapping from OWL description onto resource space and analyze the normal forms of the generated resource space. Mapping back from resource space onto OWL description is then discussed. Further, we investigate the mapping between OWL description and relational database, as well as the mapping between relational database and resource space. Normal forms of the generated relational tables are analyzed. To support advanced applications on the future Web, we suggest integrating the resource space, OWL, and databases to form a powerful semantic platform that enables different semantic models to enhance each other.", "authors": [{"name": "hai zhuge", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100417107"}, {"name": "yunpeng xing", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81343509024"}, {"name": "peng shi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375603900"}], "title": "Resource space model, OWL and database: Mapping and integration", "citations": [{"Name": "Sunita S.

This article presents a framework for assessing the security of Internet technology components that support a globally distributed workplace. Four distinct information flow and design architectures are identified based on location sensitivities and placements of the infrastructure components. Using a combination of scenarios, architectures, and technologies, the article presents the framework of a development tool for information security officers to evaluate the security posture of an information system. To aid managers in better understanding their options to improve security of the system, we also propose a three-dimensional representation, based on the framework, for embedding solution alternatives.

Interactive Web search divides the search process into several rounds, and for each round the search engine interacts with the user for more knowledge of the user's information requirement. Previous research mainly uses the text information on Web pages, while little attention is paid to other modalities. This article shows that Web search performance can be significantly improved if imagery is considered in interactive Web search. Compared with text, imagery has its own advantage: the time for \u201creading\u201d an image is as little as that for reading one or two words, while the information brought by an image is as much as that conveyed by a whole passage of text. In order to exploit the advantages of imagery, a novel interactive Web search framework is proposed, whereimage snippetsare first extracted from Web pages and then provided, along with the text snippets, to the user for result presentation and relevance feedback, as well as being presented alone to the user for image suggestion. User studies show that it is more convenient for the user to identify the Web pages he or she expects and to reformulate the initial query. Further experiments demonstrate the promise of introducing multimodal techniques into the proposed interactive Web search framework.", "authors": [{"name": "xiao-bing xue", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81546145656"}, {"name": "zhi-hua zhou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451593001"}, {"name": "zhongfei mark zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451593853"}], "title": "Improving Web search using image snippets", "citations": [{"Name": "Xinxin Wang ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "K.

Current discovery solutions were developed in the context of automatic service composition. Thus, the \u201cclient\u201d of the discovery procedure is an automated computer program rather than a human, with little, if any, tolerance to inexact results. However, in the real world, services which might be semantically distanced from each other are glued together using manual coding. In this article, we propose a new retrieval model for semantic Web services, with the objective of simplifying service discovery for human users. The model relies on simple and extensible keyword-based query language and enables efficient retrieval of approximate results, including approximate service compositions. Since representing all possible compositions and all approximate concept references can result in an exponentially-sized index, we investigate clustering methods to provide a scalable mechanism for service indexing. Results of experiments, designed to evaluate our indexing and query methods, show that satisfactory approximate search is feasible with efficient processing time.", "authors": [{"name": "eran toch", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81341497538"}, {"name": "avigdor gal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100568139"}, {"name": "iris reinhartz-berger", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100616916"}, {"name": "dov dori", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100642249"}], "title": "A semantic approach to approximate service retrieval", "citations": [{"Name": "D.

In particular, we show that business processes and Web engineering models have sufficient expressive power to support the semiautomatic extraction of semantic descriptions (i.e., WSMO ontologies, goals, Web services, and mediators), thus partially hiding the complexity of dealing with semantics. Our method is based on existing models for the specification of business processes (BPMN) combined with Web engineering models for designing and developing semantically rich Web applications (WebML). The proposed approach leads from an abstract view of the business needs to a concrete implementation of the application by means of several design steps; high-level models are transformed into software components. Our framework increases the efficiency of the whole design process, yielding to the construction of semantic Web service applications spanning over several enterprises.", "authors": [{"name": "marco brambilla", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100555834"}, {"name": "stefano ceri", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100606078"}, {"name": "federico michele facca", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100590582"}, {"name": "irene celino", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81365597065"}, {"name": "dario cerizza", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330489064"}, {"name": "emanuele della valle", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330500070"}], "title": "Model-driven design and development of semantic Web service applications", "citations": [{"Name": "Fawaz A.

Collaboration enables domains to effectively share resources; however, it introduces several security and privacy challenges. In this article, we use the current web service standards such as SOAP and UDDI to enable secure interoperability in a service-oriented mediator-free environment. We propose a multihop SOAP messaging protocol that enables domains to discover secure access paths to access roles in different domains. Then we propose a path authentication mechanism based on the encapsulation of SOAP messages and the SOAP-DISG standard. Furthermore, we provide a service discovery protocol that enables domains to discover service descriptions stored in private UDDI registries.", "authors": [{"name": "mohamed shehab", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100115691"}, {"name": "kamal bhattacharya", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332490028"}, {"name": "arif ghafoor", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100493628"}], "title": "Web services discovery in secure collaboration environments", "citations": [{"Name": "Jinwei Hu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ruixuan Li ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zhengding Lu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jianfeng Lu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiaopu Ma", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zakaria Maamar ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Djamel Bela\u00efd ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Khouloud Boukadi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Samir Tata", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "21\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "1109\n", "Citation Count": "4\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Cameroon", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "purdue university west lafayette in", "city": "west", "Name": "mohamed shehab"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm tj watson yorktown heights ny", "city": null, "Name": "kamal bhattacharya"}, {"country": "Cameroon", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "purdue university west lafayette in", "city": "west", "Name": "arif ghafoor"}]}}, "date": {"month": "November", "year": "2007"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 11": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/1361186.1361187", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "qusay h mahmoud", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100518454"}, {"name": "peter langendoerfer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100294707"}], "title": "Guest editorial: Service-oriented computing", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "21\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "462\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "canada", "university": "university of guelph", "affiliation_string": "university of guelph canada", "city": "guelph", "Name": "qusay h mahmoud"}]}, "Article No.: 15": {"references": ["Alexander, C. 1979.

Unfortunately, existing technologies used for service-oriented middleware architectures, such as Web services, P2P systems, coordination and cooperation technologies, and spontaneous networking, do not fully support all requirements in the realm of loosely coupled business services yet. Typical problems that arise in many business domains are for instance missing central control, complex cooperation models, complex lookup models, or issues regarding dynamic deployment. We used a pattern-based approach to identify the well working solutions in the different technologies for loosely coupled services. Then we reused this design knowledge in our concept for a service-oriented middleware. This concept is centered around a controlled environment, called a federation. Each remote object (a peer service) is controlled in one or more federations, but within this environment peers can collaborate in a simple-to-use, loosely coupled, and ad hoc style of communication. A semantic lookup service is used to let the peers publish rich metadata about themselves to their fellow peers.", "authors": [{"name": "uwe zdun", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100630405"}], "title": "Pattern-based design of a service-oriented middleware for remote object federations", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "26\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "908\n", "Citation Count": "4\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "austria", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "vienna university of technology wien austria", "city": null, "Name": "uwe zdun"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["S.

Specifically, we manage services not only as individuals, but more importantly as meaningful aggregated entities based on the logical compositional needs coming from the applications, by composing services properly according to QoS requirements at application setup time, and performing continuous maintenance at application runtime seamlessly. Our service management framework is scalable in two dimensions: network size and application's client population size. Specifically, the framework employs a decentralized management solution that scales to large network size, and explores resource sharing in one-to-many group-based applications by means of multicasting mechanisms. Moreover, it incorporates local adaptation operations and distributed failure detection, reporting, and recovery mechanisms to deal with runtime resource fluctuations and failures.", "authors": [{"name": "jingwen jin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100054970"}, {"name": "klara nahrstedt", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100509870"}], "title": "QoS-Aware service management for component-based distributed applications", "citations": [{"Name": "Chunyang Ye ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jun Wei ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hua Zhong ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tao Huang", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "18\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "871\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of illinois at urbana-champaign", "city": null, "Name": "jingwen jin"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of illinois at urbana-champaign", "city": null, "Name": "klara nahrstedt"}]}, "Article No.: 12": {"references": ["Nayef Abu-Ghazaleh , Michael J.

It is critical to\r\ndevise effective bindings between XML and C/C++ data to efficiently\r\ninteroperate with other XML-based services. Binding application\r\ndata to XML has many software solutions, ranging from generic\r\ndocument object models to idiosyncratic type mappings. A safe\r\nbinding must conform to XML validation constraints, guarantee type\r\nsafety, and should preserve the structural integrity of\r\ncommunicated application data. However, tight XML bindings impose\r\nmapping constraints that can hamper interoperability between\r\nservices. This paper presents a framework for constructing loosely\r\ncoupled C/C++ services based on a programming model that integrates\r\nXML bindings into the C and C++ syntax. The concepts behind the\r\nbindings are generic, which makes the approach applicable to other\r\nprogramming languages.", "authors": [{"name": "robert a van engelen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375612912"}], "title": "A framework for service-oriented computing with C and C++ Web service components", "citations": [{"Name": "Bhavik Shah ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Praveen R.

The proper functioning of such system depends on whether or not each individual service behaves as the other services expect it to behave. Since services may be developed and operated independently, it is unrealistic to assume that this is always the case. This article addresses the problem of checking and quantifying how much the actual behavior of a service, as recorded in message logs, conforms to the expected behavior as specified in a process model. We consider the case where the expected behavior is defined using the BPEL industry standard (Business Process Execution Language for Web Services). BPEL process definitions are translated into Petri nets and Petri net-based conformance checking techniques are applied to derive two complementary indicators of conformance:fitnessandappropriateness. The approach has been implemented in a toolset for business process analysis and mining, namely ProM, and has been tested in an environment comprising multiple Oracle BPEL servers.", "authors": [{"name": "wil m p van der aalst", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350598089"}, {"name": "marlon dumas", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100557599"}, {"name": "chun ouyang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100423782"}, {"name": "anne rozinat", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350570775"}, {"name": "eric verbeek", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81324494555"}], "title": "Conformance checking of service behavior", "citations": [{"Name": "Reza Babaee ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Seyed Morteza Babamir", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shiping Chen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "David Levy ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jinhui Yao", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wil M.

By allowing peers serving each other in the network, P2P technology overcomes many limitations in the traditional client-server paradigm to achieve user and bandwidth scalabilities. However, existing systems do not perform well when the number of online students increases, and the system performance degrades seriously. One of the reasons is that the construction of the peer overlay in existing P2P systems has not considered the underlying physical network topology and can cause serious topology mismatch between the P2P overlay network and the physical network. The topology mismatch problem brings great link stress (unnecessary traffic) in the Internet infrastructure and greatly degrades the system performance. In this article, we address this problem and propose a locality-aware P2P overlay construction method, calledNearcast, which builds an efficient overlay multicast tree by letting each peer node choose physically closer nodes as its logical children.We have conducted extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of Nearcast in comparison with the existing RTT and NICE protocols. Also, Nearcast has been deployed on a wide-area network testbed to delivery video coursed to about 7200 users distributed across 100 collages in 32 cities in China. The experimental results show that Nearcast leads to lower link stress and shorter end-to-end latencies compared with the RTT and NICE protocols.", "authors": [{"name": "xuping tu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81343507246"}, {"name": "hai jin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100055098"}, {"name": "xiaofei liao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100507490"}, {"name": "jiannong cao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451598988"}], "title": "Nearcast: A locality-aware P2P live streaming approach for distance education", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "13\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "965\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "huazhong university of science and technology wuhan china", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "xuping tu"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "huazhong university of science and technology wuhan china", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "hai jin"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "huazhong university of science and technology wuhan china", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "xiaofei liao"}, {"country": "japan", "university": "polytechnic university", "affiliation_string": "hong kong polytechnic university kowloon hong kong", "city": "sagamihara", "Name": "jiannong cao"}]}, "Article No.: 3": {"references": ["ACM. 1998.

Our infrastructure includes personalization strategies both at the query and the query results level. Query rewriting is based on learning and language preferences; rule-based and ranking-based personalization improves these results further. Rule-based reasoning techniques are supported by formal ontologies we have developed based on standard information models for learning domains; ranking-based recommendations are supported through ensuring minimal sets of predicates appearing in query results.

This is particularly true for people with disabilities for whom digital barriers should be overstepped with the aim of reengaging them back into society to education. In essence, before a mass of learners can be engaged in a collective educational process, each single member should be put in the position to enjoy accessible and customized educational experiences, regardless of the wide diversity of their personal characteristics and technological equipment. To respond to this demand, we developed LOT (Learning Object Transcoder), a distributed PHP-based service-oriented system designed to deliver flexible and customized educational services for a multitude of learners, each with his/her own diverse preferences and needs. The main novelty of LOT amounts to a broking service able to manage the transcoding activities needed to convert multimedia digital material into the form which better fits a given student profile. Transcoding activities are performed based on the use of Web service technologies. Experimental results gathered from several field trials with LOT (available online at http://137.204.74.83/\u223clot/) have confirmed the viability of our approach.", "authors": [{"name": "paola salomoni", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100163109"}, {"name": "silvia mirri", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314484120"}, {"name": "stefano ferretti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100149540"}, {"name": "marco roccetti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100141776"}], "title": "A multimedia broker to support accessible and mobile learning through learning objects adaptation", "citations": [{"Name": "Stefano Ferretti ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Paola Salomoni ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marco Roccetti ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Silvia Mirri ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ludovico A.

A number of technology issues are discussed, including distributed learning, collaborative learning, distributed content management, mobile and situated learning, and multimodal interaction and augmented devices for e-learning. Although we have tried to include the state-of-the-art technologies and systems here, it is anticipated that many new ones will emerge in the near future.

As such, they seem particularly suitable to realize multiparty, cross-organizational systems. Multi-Agent Systems are a natural candidate to realize Socio-Technical Systems. However, while Socio-Technical Systems envisage an explicit layer that contains the regulations that all parties must respect in their interaction, and thus preserve the agents' autonomy, current frameworks and platforms require to hard-code the coordination requirements inside the agents. We propose to explicitly represent the missing layer of Socio-Technical Systems in terms of social relationships among the involved parties, that is, in terms of a set of normatively defined relationships among two or more parties, subject to social control by monitoring the observable behaviour. In our proposal, social relationships are resources, available to agents, who use them in their practical reasoning. Both agents and social relationships are first-class entities of the model. The work also describes 2COMM4JADE, a framework that realizes the proposal by extending the well-known JADE and CArtAgO. The impact of the approach on programming is explained both conceptually and with the help of an example.", "authors": [{"name": "matteo baldoni", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100566021"}, {"name": "cristina baroglio", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100139646"}, {"name": "federico capuzzimati", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87259289257"}], "title": "A Commitment-Based Infrastructure for Programming Socio-Technical Systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Matteo Baldoni ", "Country": "argentina", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Cristina Baroglio ", "Country": "argentina", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Amit K.

Discovering latent topics from social streams is therefore important for many downstream applications, such as clustering, classification or recommendation. However, traditional topic models that rely on the bag-of-words assumption are insufficient to uncover the rich semantics and temporal aspects of topics in Twitter. In particular, microblog content is often influenced by external information sources, such as Web documents linked from Twitter posts, and often focuses on specific entities, such as people or organizations. These external sources provide useful semantics to understand microblogs and we generally refer to these semantics asauxiliary semantics. In this article, we address the mentioned issues and propose a unified framework for Multifaceted Topic Modeling from Twitter streams. We first extract social semantics from Twitter by modeling the social chatter associated with hashtags. We further extract terms and named entities from linked Web documents to serve as auxiliary semantics during topic modeling. The Multifaceted Topic Model (MfTM) is then proposed to jointly model latent semantics among the social terms from Twitter, auxiliary terms from the linked Web documents and named entities. Moreover, we capture the temporal characteristics of each topic. An efficient online inference method for MfTM is developed, which enables our model to be applied to large-scale and streaming data. Our experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness and efficiency of our model compared with state-of-the-art baselines. We evaluate each aspect of our framework and show its utility in the context of tweet clustering.", "authors": [{"name": "jan vosecky", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502806971"}, {"name": "di jiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490641876"}, {"name": "kenneth wai-ting leung", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81388591559"}, {"name": "kai xing", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658673424"}, {"name": "wilfred ng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81423593726"}], "title": "Integrating Social and Auxiliary Semantics for Multifaceted Topic Modeling in Twitter", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "123\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "246\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "hong kong university of science and technology kowloon hong kong", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "jan vosecky"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "hong kong university of science and technology kowloon hong kong", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "di jiang"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "hong kong university of science and technology kowloon hong kong", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "kenneth wai-ting leung"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "hong kong university of science and technology kowloon hong kong", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "kai xing"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "hong kong university of science and technology kowloon hong kong", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "wilfred ng"}]}, "Article No.: 24": {"references": ["Mohamed Ahmed , Stella Spagna , Felipe Huici , Saverio Niccolini, A peek into the future: predicting the evolution of popularity in user generated content, Proceedings of the sixth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining, February 04-08, 2013, Rome, Italy[doi>10.1145/2433396.2433473]\n", "Ashton Anderson , Ravi Kumar , Andrew Tomkins , Sergei Vassilvitskii, The dynamics of repeat consumption, Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on World wide web, April 07-11, 2014, Seoul, Korea[doi>10.1145/2566486.2568018]\n", "Youmna Borghol , Sebastien Ardon , Niklas Carlsson , Derek Eager , Anirban Mahanti, The untold story of the clones: content-agnostic factors that impact YouTube video popularity, Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining, August 12-16, 2012, Beijing, China[doi>10.1145/2339530.2339717]\n", "Youmna Borghol , Siddharth Mitra , Sebastien Ardon , Niklas Carlsson , Derek Eager , Anirban Mahanti, Characterizing and modelling popularity of user-generated videos, Performance Evaluation, v.68 n.11, p.1037-1055, November, 2011[doi>10.1016/j.peva.2011.07.008]\n", "Anders Brodersen, Salvatore Scellato, and Mirjam Wattenhofer. 2012.

However, the rapid growth of social media causes difficulties for users to efficiently retrieve their desired media items. Fortunately, users' digital footprints on social networks such as comments massively reflect individual's fine-grained preference on media items, that is, preference on different aspects of the media content, which can then be used for personalized social media search. In this article, we propose SESAME, a fine-grained preference-aware social media search framework leveraging user digital footprints on social networks. First, we collect users' direct feedback on media content from their social networks. Second, we extract users' sentiment about the media content and the associated keywords from their comments to characterize their fine-grained preference. Third, we propose a parallel multituple based ranking tensor factorization algorithm to perform the personalized media item ranking by incorporating two unique features, viz., integrating an enhanced bootstrap sampling method by considering user activeness and adopting stochastic gradient descent parallelization techniques. We experimentally evaluate the SESAME framework using two datasets collected from Foursquare and YouTube, respectively. The results show that SESAME can subtly capture user preference on social media items and consistently outperform baseline approaches by achieving better personalized ranking quality.", "authors": [{"name": "dingqi yang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81552740956"}, {"name": "daqing zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81300044601"}, {"name": "zhiyong yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413593708"}, {"name": "zhiwen yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375594776"}, {"name": "djamal zeghlache", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100400070"}], "title": "SESAME: Mining User Digital Footprints for Fine-Grained Preference-Aware Social Media Search", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "129\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "14\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "259\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "france", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "institut mines-telecomtelecom sudparis evry france", "city": null, "Name": "dingqi yang"}, {"country": "france", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "institut mines-telecomtelecom sudparis evry france", "city": null, "Name": "daqing zhang"}, {"country": "china", "university": "fuzhou university", "affiliation_string": "fuzhou university fujian china", "city": "fuzhou", "Name": "zhiyong yu"}, {"country": "China", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "northwestern polytechnical university shaanxi china", "city": "shaanxi", "Name": "zhiwen yu"}, {"country": "france", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "institut mines-telecomtelecom sudparis evry france", "city": null, "Name": "djamal zeghlache"}]}}, "date": {"month": "December", "year": "2014"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Daniel J.

This article introduces a novel approach that uses operator instrumentation, that is, modifying the behavior of operators, to generate and propagate fine-grained provenance through several operators of a query network. In addition to applying this technique to compute provenance eagerly during query execution, we also study how to decouple provenance computation from query processing to reduce runtime overhead and avoid unnecessary provenance retrieval. Our proposals include computing a concise superset of the provenance (to allow lazily replaying a query and reconstruct its provenance) as well as lazy retrieval (to avoid unnecessary reconstruction of provenance). We develop stream-specific compression methods to reduce the computational and storage overhead of provenance generation and retrieval. Ariadne, our provenance-aware extension of the Borealis DSMS implements these techniques. Our experiments confirm that Ariadne manages provenance with minor overhead and clearly outperforms query rewrite, the current state of the art.", "authors": [{"name": "boris glavic", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384603130"}, {"name": "kyumars sheykh esmaili", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81458653230"}, {"name": "peter m fischer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81340488855"}, {"name": "nesime tatbul", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100283118"}], "title": "Efficient Stream Provenance via Operator Instrumentation", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "53\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "116\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "illinois institute of technology chicago il", "city": "chicago", "Name": "boris glavic"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "kyumars sheykh esmaili"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "peter m fischeruniversity of freiburg germany"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "nesime tatbul"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Bogdan Alexe , Wang-Chiew Tan , Yannis Velegrakis, STBenchmark: towards a benchmark for mapping systems, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, v.1 n.1, August 2008[doi>10.14778/1453856.1453886]\n", "Kyle Anderson, Adrian Ocneanu, Diego Benitez, Derrick Carlson, Anthony Rowe, and Mario Berges. 2012.

However, another dimension of semantic coupling also exists and poses a challenge to the scalability of event processing systems in highly semantically heterogeneous and dynamic environments such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Current state-of-the-art approaches of content-based and concept-based event systems require a significant agreement between event producers and consumers on event schema or an external conceptual model of event semantics. Thus, they do not address the semantic coupling issue. This article proposes an approach where participants only agree on a distributional statistical model of semantics represented in a corpus of text to derive semantic similarity and relatedness. It also proposes an approximate model for relaxing the semantic coupling dimension via an approximation-enabled rule language and an approximate event matcher. The model is formalized as an ensemble of semantic and top-kmatchers along with a probability model for uncertainty management. The model has been empirically validated on large sets of events and subscriptions synthesized from real-world smart city and energy management systems. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves more than 95&percnt; F1Score of effectiveness and thousands of events/sec of throughput for medium degrees of approximation while not requiring users to have complete prior knowledge of event semantics. In semantically loosely-coupled environments, one approximate subscription can compensate for hundreds of exact subscriptions to cover all possibilities in environments which require complete prior knowledge of event semantics. Results indicate that approximate semantic event processing could play a promising role in the IoT middleware layer.", "authors": [{"name": "souleiman hasan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81503684364"}, {"name": "edward curry", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81503690243"}], "title": "Approximate Semantic Matching of Events for the Internet of Things", "citations": [{"Name": "Danilo Carvalho ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "\u00c7a\u01e7atay \u00c7alli ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andr\u00e9 Freitas ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Edward Curry", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yongrui Qin ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Quan Z.

Existing systems either provide no guarantees on event deliveries, do not support multicast and thus provide no guarantees across individual processes, or then rely on centralized components or strong assumptions on the infrastructure.The FAIDECS system attempts to reconcile strong guarantees with practical performance in the presence of process crash failures. To that end, the FAIDECS system uses an overlay network with specific guarantees aligned with its proposed correlation language and guarantees. However, the language proposed lacks expressivity, and the system itself supports only very specific rigid semantics, incapable of supporting even fundamental features like sliding windows.After providing a comprehensive overview of the FAIDECS model and system, this article bridges the gap between strong guarantees and more established correlation languages and systems in several steps. First, we propose alternative semantics for several modules of the FAIDECS matching engine and revisit guarantees.

Most related past work has been domain-dependent (e.g., video surveillance, cybersecurity) and has focused on the valuable class ofstatistical anomaliesin which statistically unusual events are considered. In contrast, suppose there is a setAof known activity models (both harmless and harmful) and a logLof time-stamped observations. We define a partL'&subseteq;Lof the log to represent anunexplained situationwhen none of the known activity models can explainL' with a score exceeding a user-specified threshold. We represent activities viaprobabilistic penalty graphs(PPGs) and show how a set of PPGs can be combined into one Super-PPG for which we define an index structure. Given a compute cluster of (K&plus; 1) nodes (one of which is a master node), we show how to split a Super-PPG intoKsubgraphs, each of which can be independently processed by a compute node. We provide algorithms for the individual compute nodes to ensure seamless handoffs that maximally leverage parallelism. PADUA is domain-independent and can be applied to many domains (perhaps with some specialization). We conducted detailed experiments with PADUA on two real-world datasets\u2014the ITEA CANDELA video surveillance dataset and a network traffic dataset appropriate for cybersecurity applications. PADUA scales extremely well with the number of processors and significantly outperforms past work both in accuracy and time. Thus, PADUA represents the first parallel architecture and algorithm for identifying unexplained situations in observation data, offering both scalability and accuracy.", "authors": [{"name": "cristian molinaro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350577582"}, {"name": "vincenzo moscato", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100633518"}, {"name": "antonio picariello", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375600136"}, {"name": "andrea pugliese", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100366308"}, {"name": "antonino rullo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658626596"}, {"name": "v s subrahmanian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81556103256"}], "title": "PADUA: Parallel Architecture to Detect Unexplained Activities", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "71\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "174\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "italy", "university": "university of calabria", "affiliation_string": "university of calabria", "city": "cosenza", "Name": "cristian molinaro"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of naples federico ii", "affiliation_string": "university of naples federico ii", "city": "naples", "Name": "vincenzo moscato"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of naples federico ii", "affiliation_string": "university of naples federico ii", "city": "naples", "Name": "antonio picariello"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of calabria", "affiliation_string": "university of calabria", "city": "cosenza", "Name": "andrea pugliese"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of calabria", "affiliation_string": "university of calabria", "city": "cosenza", "Name": "antonino rullo"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of maryland", "city": null, "Name": "v s subrahmanian"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Daniel J.

In contrast to other stream revision approaches developed so far, our novel technique encapsulates the event detector, uses the buffering technique to delay events but also speculatively processes a portion of it, and adapts the degree of speculation at runtime to fit the available system resources so that detection latency becomes minimal.Our technique outperforms known approaches on both synthetical data and real sensor data from a realtime locating system (RTLS) with several thousands of out-of-order sensor events per second.

It is difficult to acquire such information from customer usage data because voice minutes and data bandwidth are typically sold in the form of large quotas. We address this issue by studying how end-users consume their quotas, both in a prepaid setting (where users pay in advance and refill as needed) and a postpaid setting (where users pay each month for a fixed amount of quota). Our presentation has three main parts. In the first we present data on quota usage for prepaid voice/text services and show that users reduce their voice usage when their balances become low. Moreover, when balances are low there is a tendency to shift from voice to SMS. In the second part, we provide descriptive models of both prepaid and postpaid services. The main feature of these models is that there is a background level of potential demand and the rate at which this potential demand is realized depends on the amount of quota balance available. In the third part, we propose utility maximizing models that can account for this type of behavior. In the prepaid case the main feature of the model is a discount function that represents the perceived cost to the user of a quota refill that will occur sometime in the future. In the postpaid case, where the end-user is attempting to get the maximum amount of utility from his monthly quota, we present a dynamic programming formulation in which utility functions are time varying and not known to the user in advance.", "authors": [{"name": "matthew andrews", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100028731"}, {"name": "glenn bruns", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100166075"}, {"name": "mustafa dogru", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81467666303"}, {"name": "hyoseop lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658651142"}], "title": "Understanding Quota Dynamics in Wireless Networks", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "73\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "127\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "bell labs alcatel-lucent", "city": null, "Name": "matthew andrews"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "bell labs alcatel-lucent", "city": null, "Name": "glenn bruns"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "bell labs alcatel-lucent", "city": null, "Name": "mustafa dogru"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "bell labs alcatel-lucent", "city": null, "Name": "hyoseop lee"}]}, "Article No.: 19": {"references": ["Klaus Abbink. 2004.

Traditional QoS-aware composition techniques usually consider the qualities available at the time of the composition because compositions are usually immediately consumed. This is fundamentally different in the cloud environment where the cloud service composition typically lasts for a relatively long period of time. The two most important drivers when composing cloud service are the long-term nature of the composition and the economic motivation for outsourcing tasks to the cloud. We propose an economic model, which we represent as a Bayesian network, to select and compose cloud services. We then leverage influence diagrams to model the cloud service composition. We further extend the traditional influence diagram problem to a hybrid one and adopt an extended Shenoy-Shafer architecture to solve such hybrid influence diagrams that include deterministic chance nodes. In addition, analytical and simulation results are presented to show the performance of the proposed composition approach.", "authors": [{"name": "zhen ye", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548036270"}, {"name": "athman bouguettaya", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100532151"}, {"name": "xiaofang zhou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81552191756"}], "title": "Economic Model-Driven Cloud Service Composition", "citations": [{"Name": "Pl\u00e1cido A.

The recent emergence of IoT devices with embedded execution environments allows practitioners to deploy and execute custom application logic directly on the device. This approach fundamentally changes the overall process of designing, developing, deploying, and managing IoT systems. However, these devices exhibit significant differences in available execution environments, processing, and storage capabilities. To accommodate this diversity, a structured approach is needed to uniformly and transparently deploy application components onto a large number of heterogeneous devices. This is especially important in the context of large-scale IoT systems, such as in the smart city domain. In this article, we present LEONORE, an infrastructure toolset that provides elastic provisioning of application components on resource-constrained and heterogeneous edge devices in large-scale IoT deployments. LEONORE supports push-based as well as pull-based deployments. To improve scalability and reduce generated network traffic between cloud and edge infrastructure, we present a distributed provisioning approach that deploys LEONORE local nodes within the deployment infrastructure close to the actual edge devices. We show that our solution is able to elastically provision large numbers of devices using a testbed based on a real-world industry scenario.", "authors": [], "title": "A Scalable Framework for Provisioning Large-Scale IoT Deployments", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "50\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "50\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "50\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "johannes m schleicherchristian inzinger", "city": null, "Name": "michael vogler"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Palakorn Achananuparp, Xiaohua Hu, and Xiajiong Shen. 2008.

To date, most existing work on diffusion sources detection are based on the assumption that network snapshots that reflect information diffusion can be obtained continuously. However, obtaining snapshots of an entire network needs to deploy detectors on all network nodes and thus is very expensive. Alternatively, in this article, we study the diffusion sources locating problem by learning from information diffusion data collected from only a small subset of network nodes. Specifically, we present a new regression learning model that can detect anomalous diffusion sources by jointly solving five challenges, that is, unknown number of source nodes, few activated detectors, unknown initial propagation time, uncertain propagation path and uncertain propagation time delay.

An important issue related to the appearance of such a large-scale self-coordinating IoT is the reliability and the collaboration between the objects in the presence of environmental hazards. High failure rates lead to significant loss of data. Therefore, data survivability is a main challenge of the IoT. In this article, we have developed a compartmental e-Epidemic SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model to save the data in the network and let it survive after attacks. Furthermore, our model takes into account the dynamic topology of the network where natural death (crashing nodes) and birth are defined and analyzed.

While the literature abounds of approaches detecting duplicates corresponding to the same real-world entity, most of these approaches tend to eliminate duplicates (wrong information) from the sources, hence leading to what is calleddata repair.In this article, we propose a framework that automatically detects duplicates at query time and effectively identifies the consistent version of the data, while keeping inconsistent data in the sources. Our framework uses matching dependencies (MDs) to detect duplicates through the concept of data reconciliation rules (DRR) and conditional function dependencies (CFDs) to assess the quality of different attribute values. We also build a duplicate reconciliation index (DRI), based on clusters of duplicates detected by a set of DRRs to speed up the online data reconciliation process. Our experiments of a real-world data collection show the efficiency and effectiveness of our framework.", "authors": [{"name": "asma abboura", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658973171"}, {"name": "soror sahri", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384611887"}, {"name": "latifa baba-hamed", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87658672257"}, {"name": "mourad ouziri", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81317498510"}, {"name": "salima benbernou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100425392"}], "title": "Quality-Based Online Data Reconciliation", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "105\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "73\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "105\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "asma abboura"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "soror sahriuniversite paris descartes sorbonnes paris cite france"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "latifa baba-hamed"}, {"country": "France", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universite paris descartes sorbonnes paris cite france", "city": "paris", "Name": "mourad ouziri"}, {"country": "France", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universite paris descartes sorbonnes paris cite france", "city": "paris", "Name": "salima benbernou"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Appendix. 2014.

The knowledge can be employed to identify semantically related objects. It helps, for example, a recommender system to generate effective recommendations to the users. We propose to study a new semantic network, namely, theConcept Relation Network (CRN), which is efficiently constructed and maintained using existing web search engines. CRN tackles the uncertainty and dynamics of web content, and thus is optimized for many important web applications, such as social networks and search engines. It is a large semantic network for the collection, analysis, and interpretation of web content, and serves as a cornerstone for applications such as web search engines, recommendation systems, and social networks that can benefit from a large-scale knowledge base. In this article, we present two applications for CRN: (1) search engine and web analytic and (2) semantic information retrieval. Experimental results show that CRN effectively enhances these applications by considering the heterogenous and polysemous nature of web content.", "authors": [{"name": "kenneth wai-ting leung", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81388591559"}, {"name": "di jiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490641876"}, {"name": "dik lun lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81385591271"}, {"name": "wilfred ng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81423593726"}], "title": "Constructing Maintainable Semantic Relation Network from Ambiguous Concepts in Web Content", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "74\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "57\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "74\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "hong kong university of science and technology hong kong", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "kenneth wai-ting leung"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "hong kong university of science and technology", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "di jiang"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "hong kong university of science and technology hong kong", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "dik lun lee"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "hong kong university of science and technology hong kong", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "wilfred ng"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["P.

Banner advertisements form a critical component of this income, accounting for 40 to 50 percent of the total revenue. There are considerable gains to be realized through the efficient scheduling of banner advertisements. This problem has been observed to be intractable via traditional optimization techniques, and has received only limited attention in the literature. This paper presents a procedure to generate advertisement schedules under the most commonly used advertisement pricing scheme---the CPM model. The solution approach is based on Lagrangean decomposition and is seen to provide extremely good advertisement schedules in a relatively short period of time, taking only a few hundred seconds of elapsed time on a 450 MHz PC compared to a few thousand seconds of CPU time on a workstation that other approaches need. Additionally, this approach can be incorporated into an actual implementation with minimal alterations and hence is of particular interest.", "authors": [{"name": "ali amiri", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100314906"}, {"name": "syam menon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100196646"}], "title": "Efficient scheduling of Internet banner advertisements", "citations": [{"Name": "Richard Gomer ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Eduarda Mendes Rodrigues ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Natasa Milic-Frayling ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "M.

Understanding and measuring such end-to-end service performance is a challenging task. Current techniques include periodic sampling of service characteristics from strategic locations in the network and instrumenting Web pages with code that reports client-perceived latency back to a performance server. Limitations to these approaches include potentially nonrepresentative access patterns in the first case and determining the location of a performance bottleneck in the second.This paper presents EtE monitor, a novel approach to measuring Web site performance. Our system passively collects packet traces from a server site to determine service performance characteristics. We introduce a two-pass heuristic and a statistical filtering mechanism to accurately reconstruct different client page accesses and to measure performance characteristics integrated across all client accesses. Relative to existing approaches, EtE monitor offers the following benefits: i) a latency breakdown between the network and server overhead of retrieving a Web page, ii) longitudinal information for all client accesses, not just the subset probed by a third party, iii) characteristics of accesses that are aborted by clients, iv) an understanding of the performance breakdown of accesses to dynamic, multitiered services, and v) quantification of the benefits of network and browser caches on server performance. Our initial implementation and performance analysis across three different commercial Web sites confirm the utility of our approach.", "authors": [{"name": "ludmila cherkasova", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100403256"}, {"name": "yun fu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100244584"}, {"name": "wenting tang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100640567"}, {"name": "amin vahdat", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100104394"}], "title": "Measuring and characterizing end-to-end Internet service performance", "citations": [{"Name": "Balachander Krishnamurthy ", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Harsha V.

This is especially true for the emerging virtual enterprises with their data and processing capabilities spread across the Internet. Unfortunately, however, query processing on the Internet is not predictable and robust enough to meet the requirements of many business applications. For instance, the response time of a query can be unexpectedly high; or the monetary cost might be too high if the partners charge for the usage of their data or processing capabilities; or the result of the query might be useless because it is based on outdated data or only on parts (rather than all) of the available data. In this work, we show how a distributed query processor can be extended in order to support quality of service (QoS) guarantees. We propose ways to integrate QoS management into the various phases of query processing: (1) Query optimization uses a multi-dimensional assessment (cost, time and result quality) of query plans, (2) query plan instantiation comprises an admission control for sub-plans, and (3) during query plan execution the QoS of the query is monitored and a fuzzy controller initiates repairing actions if needed. The goal of our work is to provide an initial step towards QoS management in distributed query processing systems and do significantly better than current distributed database systems, which are based on a best-effort policy.", "authors": [{"name": "r braumandl", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100624477"}, {"name": "a kemper", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100502713"}, {"name": "d kossmann", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100626540"}], "title": "Quality of service in an information economy", "citations": [{"Name": "Tobias Scholl ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bernhard Bauer ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Benjamin Gufler ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Richard Kuntschke ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daniel Weber ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Angelika Reiser ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alfons Kemper", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "S.

The paper develops two main contributions: (a) a specific design methodology for data-intensive Web sites, composed of a set of steps and design transformations that lead from a conceptual specification of the domain of interest to the actual implementation of the site; (b) a tool called Homer, conceived to support the site design and implementation process, by allowing the designer to move through the various steps of the methodology, and to automate the generation of the code needed to implement the actual site.Our approach to site design is based on a clear separation between several design activities, namely database design, hypertext design, and presentation design. All these activities are carried on by using high-level models, all subsumed by an extension of the nested relational model; the mappings between the models can be nicely expressed using an extended relational algebra for nested structures. Based on the design artifacts produced during the design process, and on their representation in the algebraic framework, Homeris able to generate all the code needed for the actual generation of the site, in a completely automatic way.", "authors": [{"name": "paolo merialdo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100556821"}, {"name": "paolo atzeni", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100564848"}, {"name": "giansalvatore mecca", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100580579"}], "title": "Design and development of data-intensive web sites: The Araneus approach", "citations": [{"Name": "Paolo Atzeni ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Pierluigi Del Nostro ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Stefano Paolozzi", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andrea R. de Andrade ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ethan V.

To provide a means of evaluating and comparing (benchmarking) research methods in this area, the Trading Agent Competition (TAC) was established. This competition involves a number of agents bidding against one another in a number of related auctions (operating different protocols) to purchase travel packages for customers.

We believe that some of the major drivers of the wireless Internet will be emerging mobile applications such as mobile commerce. Although many of these are futuristic, some applications including user-and location-specific mobile advertising, location-based services, and mobile financial services are beginning to be commercialized. Mobile commerce applications present several interesting and complex challenges including location management of products, services, devices, and people. Further, these applications have fairly diverse requirements from the underlying wireless infrastructure in terms of location accuracy, response time, multicast support, transaction frequency and duration, and dependability. Therefore, research is necessary to address these important and complex challenges. In this article, we present an integrated location management architecture to support the diverse location requirements of m-commerce applications. The proposed architecture is capable of supporting a range of location accuracies, wider network coverage, wireless multicast, and infrastructure dependability for m-commerce applications. The proposed architecture can also support several emerging mobile applications. Additionally, several interesting research problems and directions in location management for wireless Internet applications are presented and discussed.", "authors": [{"name": "upkar varshney", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100561871"}], "title": "Location management for mobile commerce applications in wireless Internet environment", "citations": [{"Name": "Kiran Kola ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ruppa K.

We first identify various scenarios, where different applications have different requirements on the accuracy of the estimated frequency. Then we develop several \"frequency estimators\" for the identified scenarios, showing analytically and experimentally how precise they are. In many cases, our proposed estimators predict change frequencies much more accurately and improve the effectiveness of applications. For example, a Web crawler could achieve 35&percnt; improvement in \"freshness\" simply by adopting our proposed estimator.", "authors": [{"name": "junghoo cho", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100372160"}, {"name": "hector garcia-molina", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100308969"}], "title": "Estimating frequency of change", "citations": [{"Name": "Michael L.

To this end, this paper reports on the development of a heuristic decision making framework that an autonomous agent can exploit to tackle the problem of bidding across multiple auctions with varying start and end times and with varying protocols (including English, Dutch and Vickrey). The framework is flexible, configurable, and enables the agent to adopt varying tactics and strategies that attempt to ensure that the desired item is delivered in a manner consistent with the user's preferences. Given this large space of possibilities, we employ a genetic algorithm to search (offline) for effective strategies in common classes of environment. The strategies that emerge from this evolution are then codified into the agent's reasoning behaviour so that it can select the most appropriate strategy to employ in its prevailing circumstances. The proposed framework has been implemented in a simulated marketplace environment and its effectiveness has been empirically demonstrated.", "authors": [{"name": "patricia anthony", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100196269"}, {"name": "nicholas r jennings", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100581072"}], "title": "Developing a bidding agent for multiple heterogeneous auctions", "citations": [{"Name": "Minghua He ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nicholas R.

Central user modeling servers collect and process the information about users that different user-adaptive systems require to personalize their user interaction.Adaptive systems are generally better able to cater to users the more data their user modeling systems collect and process about them. They therefore gather as much data as possible and \"lay them in stock\" for possible future usage. Moreover, data collection usually takes place without users' initiative and sometimes even without their awareness, in order not to cause distraction. Both is in conflict with users' privacy concerns that became manifest in numerous recent consumer polls, and with data protection laws and guidelines that call for parsimony, purpose-orientation, and user notification or user consent when personal data are collected and processed.This article discusses security requirements to guarantee privacy in user-adaptive systems and explores ways to keep users anonymous while fully preserving personalized interaction with them. User anonymization in personalized systems goes beyond current models in that not only users must remain anonymous, but also the user modeling system that maintains their personal data. Moreover, users' trust in anonymity can be expected to lead to more extensive and frank interaction, hence to more and better data about the user, and thus to better personalization. A reference model for pseudonymous and secure user modeling is presented that meets many of the proposed requirements.", "authors": [{"name": "alfred kobsa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100644534"}, {"name": "jorg schreck", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100025605"}], "title": "Privacy through pseudonymity in user-adaptive systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Mohd M.

Web Usage Mining is the application of data mining techniques to Web clickstream data in order to extract usage patterns. Yet, with all of the resources put into the problem, claims of success have been limited and are often tied to specific Web site properties that are not found in general. One reason for the limited success has been a component of Web Usage Mining that is often overlooked---the need to understand the content and structure of a Web site. The processing and quantification of a Web sites content and structure for all but completely static and single frame Web sites is arguably one of the most difficult tasks to automate in the Web Usage Mining process. This article shows that, not only is the Web Usage Mining process enhanced by content and structure, it cannot be completed without it. The results of experiments run on data from a large e-commerce site are presented to show that proper preprocessing cannot be completed without the use of Web site content and structure, and that the effectiveness of pattern analysis is greatly enhanced.", "authors": [{"name": "robert cooley", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100060223"}], "title": "The use of web structure and content to identify subjectively interesting web usage patterns", "citations": [{"Name": "Federico Michele Facca", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Combining Web Usage Mining and XML Mining in a Real Case Study", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Brenda F.

While such analysis is essential for a variety of network management and security tasks, it is infeasible on many networks: either the volume of data is so large as to make packet inspection intractable, or privacy concerns forbid packet capture and require the dissociation of network flows from users\u2019 actual IP addresses. Our analytical framework permits useful analysis of network usage patterns even under circumstances where the only available source of data is anonymized flow records. Using this data, we are able to uncover distributions and scaling relations in host-to-host networks that bear implications for capacity planning and network application design. We also show how to classify network applications based entirely on topological properties of their overlay networks, yielding a taxonomy that allows us to accurately identify the functions of unknown applications. We repeat this analysis on a more recent dataset, allowing us to demonstrate that the aggregate behavior of users is remarkably stable even as the population changes.", "authors": [{"name": "mark meiss", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81344494670"}, {"name": "filippo menczer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100513282"}, {"name": "alessandro vespignani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100422294"}], "title": "Properties and Evolution of Internet Traffic Networks from Anonymized Flow Data", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "45\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "797\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "india", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "indiana university", "city": null, "Name": "mark meiss"}, {"country": "india", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "indiana university and institute for scientific interchange", "city": null, "Name": "filippo menczer"}, {"country": "india", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "indiana university and institute for scientific interchange", "city": null, "Name": "alessandro vespignani"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Ricardo A.

In this article we argue that the motivation of diversity research is to increase the probability of retrieving unusual or novel items which are relevant to the user and introduce a methodology to evaluate their performance in terms of novel item retrieval. Moreover, noting that the retrieval of a set of items matching a user query is a common problem across many applications of information retrieval, we formulate the trade-off between diversity and matching quality as a binary optimization problem, with an input control parameter allowing explicit tuning of this trade-off. We study solution strategies to the optimization problem and demonstrate the importance of the control parameter in obtaining desired system performance.

One major challenge in building these applications is maintaining data consistency while meeting the requirements of fast local response, total work preservation, unconstrained interaction, and customizable collaboration mode. These requirements are important in determining users\u2019 experiences in interaction and collaboration, and in meeting users\u2019 diverse needs under complex and dynamic collaboration and networking environments; but none of existing solutions is able to meet all of them. In this article, we present a data consistency maintenance solution capable of meeting these requirements for collaborative Web-based applications. Major technical contributions include an efficient sequence-based operation transformation control algorithm based on the concept of contextualization, an operation broadcast protocol for supporting a variety of collaboration modes, an operation replaying algorithm for ensuring fast local response and efficient remote operation replay, and a set of communication protocols for managing the integrity of collaborative Web-based sessions. The proposed solution has been implemented in a prototype collaborative Web-based editor WRACE and the correctness of the solution is formally verified in the article.", "authors": [{"name": "haifeng shen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409593372"}, {"name": "chengzheng sun", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409597515"}], "title": "Achieving Data Consistency by Contextualization in Web-Based Collaborative Applications", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "30\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "643\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "flinders university", "city": null, "Name": "haifeng shen"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": "nanyang technological university", "affiliation_string": "nanyang technological university", "city": "singapore", "Name": "chengzheng sun"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2011"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Saibal K.

To date, no approach has yet been proposed to solve these three problems. By exploiting mobile agent and active networking technologies, we propose a Programmable Network Address Translation (PNAT) implementation that enables peer-to-peer communication while maintaining application functionality and packet integrity. For peer-to-peer communication, our proposed PNAT approach works for various NAT types (including the Symmetric NAT) with simple APIs supported by our proposed NAT design. For application functionality, the PNAT uses the mobile code to update protocol information in packet payloads according to different application needs. For packet integrity, the PNAT allows applications to delay their data encryption until NAT begins to translate addresses and ports in packet headers. To validate our proposed PNAT approach, we implemented the PNAT design on Windows 2000, and we present an empirical performance evaluation of the implemented design.", "authors": [{"name": "tzu-chi huang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81344491922"}, {"name": "sherali zeadally", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100139634"}, {"name": "naveen chilamkurti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100604808"}, {"name": "ce-kuen shieh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452602097"}], "title": "A programmable network address translator: Design, implementation, and performance", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "21\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "540\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "taiwan", "university": "lunghwa university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "lunghwa university of science and technology taiwan", "city": "taoyuan", "Name": "tzu-chi huang"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of the district of columbia washington dc", "city": "washington", "Name": "sherali zeadally"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "la trobe university", "affiliation_string": "la trobe university australia", "city": "melbourne", "Name": "naveen chilamkurti"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "national cheng kung university", "affiliation_string": "national cheng kung university taiwan", "city": "tainan", "Name": "ce-kuen shieh"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["Alfieri, R., Cecchini, R., Ciaschini, V., Agnello, L., Frohner, A., Gianoli, A., Lorentey, K., and Spataro, F. 2003.

Earlier attempts did not catch on for a number of reasons, notably lack of interest on the part of the bandwidth providers. This, in turn, was partially caused by the lack of an efficient way of charging for bandwidth. Thus, the viability of bandwidth reservation depends on the existence of an efficient market where bandwidth-related transactions can take place. For this market to be effective, it must be efficient for both the provider (seller) and the user (buyer) of the bandwidth. This implies that: (a) the buyer must have a wide choice of providers that operate in a competitive environment, (b) the seller must be assured that a QoS transaction will be paid by the customer, and (c) the QoS transaction establishment must have low overheads so that it may be used by individual customers without a significant burden to the provider.In order to satisfy these requirements, we propose a framework that allows customers to purchase bandwidth using an open market where providers advertise links and capacities and customers bid for these services. The model is close to that of a commodities market that offers both advance bookings (futures) and a spot market. We explore the mechanisms that can support such a model.", "authors": [{"name": "david michael turner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100229502"}, {"name": "vassilis prevelakis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100044647"}, {"name": "angelos d keromytis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100083417"}], "title": "A market-based bandwidth charging framework", "citations": [{"Name": "Sami Saleh Alwakeel ", "Country": "Saudi Arabia", "Affiliation": "King Saud University"}, {"Name": "Nasser M.

We focus on attacks against the semantic integrity of the simulation. This class of attacks exploits the client-server architecture and is specific to online simulations which, for performance reasons, have to delegate the detailed rendering of the simulated world to the clients. Attacks against semantic integrity often compromise the physical laws of the simulated world\u2014enabling the user's simulation persona to fly, walk through walls, or to run faster than anybody else.We introduce the Secure Semantic Integrity Protocol (SSIP), which enables the simulation provider to audit the client computations. Then we analyze the security and scalability of SSIP. First, we show that under standard cryptographic assumptions SSIP will detect semantic integrity attacks. Second, we analyze the network overhead, and determine the optimum tradeoff between cost of bandwidth and audit frequency for our protocol.", "authors": [{"name": "somesh jha", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100352621"}, {"name": "stefan katzenbeisser", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100156701"}, {"name": "christian schallhart", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81312485738"}, {"name": "helmut veith", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100548003"}, {"name": "stephen chenney", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100292724"}], "title": "Semantic integrity in large-scale online simulations", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "15\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "370\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wisconsin", "city": null, "Name": "somesh jha"}, {"country": "germany", "university": "technische universitat darmstadt", "affiliation_string": "technische universitat darmstadt", "city": "darmstadt", "Name": "stefan katzenbeisser"}, {"country": "germany", "university": "technische universitat darmstadt", "affiliation_string": "technische universitat darmstadt", "city": "darmstadt", "Name": "christian schallhart"}, {"country": "austria", "university": "technische universitat wien", "affiliation_string": "technische universitat wien", "city": "vienna", "Name": "helmut veith"}]}}, "date": {"month": "February", "year": "2010"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Zoe Abrams , Ofer Mendelevitch , John Tomlin, Optimal delivery of sponsored search advertisements subject to budget constraints, Proceedings of the 8th ACM conference on Electronic commerce, June 11-15, 2007, San Diego, California, USA[doi>10.1145/1250910.1250950]\n", "Altendorf, E.

When one of these keywords matches a user search string, the ad is then considered for display among sponsored search results. Advertisers compete for positions in which their ads appear, as higher slots typically result in more user clicks. All existing position allocating mechanisms charge more per click for a higher slot. Therefore, an advertiser must decide whether to bid high and receive more, but more expensive, clicks.In this work, we propose a novel methodology for building forecasting landscapes relating an individual advertiser bid to the expected click-through rate and/or the expected daily click volume. Displaying such landscapes is currently offered as a service to advertisers by all major search engine providers. Such landscapes are expected to be instrumental in helping the advertisers devise their bidding strategies.We propose atriplymonotone regression methodology. We start by applying the current state-of-the-art monotone regression solution. We then propose to condition on the ad position and to estimate the bid-position and position-click effects separately. While the latter translates into a standard monotone regression problem, we devise a novel solution to the former based on approximate maximum likelihood. We show that our proposal significantly outperforms the standard monotone regression solution, while the latter similarly improves upon routinely used ad-hoc methods.Last, we discuss other e-commerce applications of the proposed intermediate variable regression methodology.", "authors": [{"name": "ilya gluhovsky", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100156910"}], "title": "Forecasting Click-Through Rates Based on Sponsored Search Advertiser Bids and Intermediate Variable Regression", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "44\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "450\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": []}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Ion Androutsopoulos , John Koutsias , Konstantinos V.

In this paper we describe and evaluate experimentally a framework that may constitute the basis for adefacement detection servicecapable of monitoring thousands of remote Web sites systematically and automatically.In our framework an organization may join the service by simply providing the URLs of the resources to be monitored along with the contact point of an administrator. The monitored organization may thus take advantage of the service with just a few mouse clicks, without installing any software locally or changing its own daily operational processes. Our approach is based on anomaly detection and allows monitoring the integrity of many remote Web resources automatically while remaining fully decoupled from them, in particular, without requiring any prior knowledge about those resources.We evaluated our approach over a selection of dynamic resources and a set of publicly available defacements. The results are very satisfactory: all attacks are detected while keeping false positives to a minimum. We also assessed performance and scalability of our proposal and we found that it may indeed constitute the basis for actually deploying the proposed service on a large scale.", "authors": [{"name": "alberto bartoli", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100017632"}, {"name": "giorgio davanzo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375620412"}, {"name": "eric medvet", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81320492985"}], "title": "A Framework for Large-Scale Detection of Web Site Defacements", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "49\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "726\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "italy", "university": "university of trieste", "affiliation_string": "university of trieste", "city": "trieste", "Name": "alberto bartoli"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of trieste", "affiliation_string": "university of trieste", "city": "trieste", "Name": "giorgio davanzo"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of trieste", "affiliation_string": "university of trieste", "city": "trieste", "Name": "eric medvet"}]}, "Article No.: 12": {"references": ["Comcast Corporation. 2008.

However, as the need for more refined Internet demographics has grown, so too has the tension between privacy and utility. Unfortunately, current techniques lean too much in favor of functional requirements over protecting the privacy of users. For example, the most prominent proposals for measuring the relative popularity of a Web site depend on the deployment of client-side measurement agents that are generally perceived as infringing on users\u2019 privacy, thereby limiting their wide-scale adoption. Moreover, the client-side nature of these techniques also makes them susceptible to various manipulation tactics that undermine the integrity of their results. In this article, we propose a new estimation technique that uses DNS cache probing to infer the density of clients accessing a given service. Compared to earlier techniques, our scheme is less invasive as it does not reveal user-specific traits, and is more robust against manipulation.

In particular, we focus on the observation that many existing Web-based trust-inference algorithms conflate the notions of \u201ctrust\u201d and \u201cconfidence,\u201d and treat the amalgamation of the two concepts to compute the trust value associated with a social relationship. Unfortunately, the result of such an algorithm that merges trust and confidence is not a trust value, but rather a new variable in the inference process. Thus, it is hard to evaluate the outputs of such an algorithm in the context of trust inference.This article first describes a formal probabilistic network model for social networks that allows us to address that issue. Then we describe SUNNY, a new trust inference algorithm that uses probabilistic sampling to separately estimate trust information and our confidence in the trust estimate and use the two values in order to compute an estimate of trust based on only those information sources with the highest confidence estimates.We present an experimental evaluation of SUNNY. In our experiments, SUNNY produced more accurate trust estimates than the well-known trust inference algorithm TidalTrust, demonstrating its effectiveness. Finally, we discuss the implications these results will have on systems designed for personalizing content and making recommendations.", "authors": [{"name": "ugur kuter", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100080797"}, {"name": "jennifer golbeck", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100123477"}], "title": "Using probabilistic confidence models for trust inference in Web-based social networks", "citations": [{"Name": "Levent V.

BogusBiter conceals a victim's real credential among bogus credentials, and moreover, it enables a legitimate Web site to identify stolen credentials in a timely manner. Leveraging the power of client-side automatic phishing detection techniques, BogusBiter is complementary to existing preventive anti-phishing approaches. We implemented BogusBiter as an extension to the Firefox 2 Web browser, and evaluated its efficacy through real experiments on both phishing and legitimate Web sites.

While a great deal of effort has been devoted to solving the phishing problem by prevention and detection of phishing emails and phishing Web sites, little research has been done in the area of training users to recognize those attacks. Our research focuses on educating users about phishing and helping them make better trust decisions. We identified a number of challenges for end-user security education in general and anti-phishing education in particular: users are not motivated to learn about security; for most users, security is a secondary task; it is difficult to teach people to identify security threats without also increasing their tendency to misjudge nonthreats as threats. Keeping these challenges in mind, we developed an email-based anti-phishing education system called \u201cPhishGuru\u201d and an online game called \u201cAnti-Phishing Phil\u201d that teaches users how to use cues in URLs to avoid falling for phishing attacks. We applied learning science instructional principles in the design of PhishGuru and Anti-Phishing Phil. In this article we present the results of PhishGuru and Anti-Phishing Phil user studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of these tools. Our results suggest that, while automated detection systems should be used as the first line of defense against phishing attacks, user education offers a complementary approach to help people better recognize fraudulent emails and websites.", "authors": [{"name": "ponnurangam kumaraguru", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81328489236"}, {"name": "steve sheng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81335497366"}, {"name": "alessandro acquisti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100485879"}, {"name": "lorrie faith cranor", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100472223"}, {"name": "jason hong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81408598366"}], "title": "Teaching Johnny not to fall for phish", "citations": [{"Name": "R.

The proposed approach applies Gestalt theory and considers a Web page as a single indivisible entity. The concept of supersignals, as a realization of Gestalt principles, supports our contention that Web pages must be treated as indivisible entities. We objectify, and directly compare, these indivisible supersignals using algorithmic complexity theory. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the problem of detecting phishing scams. Via a large-scale, real-world case study, we demonstrate that 1) our approach effectively detects similar Web pages; and 2) it accuractely distinguishes legitimate and phishing pages.", "authors": [{"name": "teh-chung chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81464643664"}, {"name": "scott dick", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331491599"}, {"name": "james miller", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81337491675"}], "title": "Detecting visually similar Web pages: Application to phishing detection", "citations": [{"Name": "Guang Xiang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jason Hong ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Carolyn P.

Many applications motivate the consideration of trust evaluation in online social networks (OSNs). Some work has been proposed based on a trusted graph. However, it is still an open challenge to construct a trusted graph, especially in terms of selecting proper recommenders, which can be used to predict the trustworthiness of an unknown target efficiently and effectively. Based on the intuition that people who are close to and influential to us can make more proper and acceptable recommendations, we present the idea of recommendation-aware trust evaluation (RATE). We further model the recommender selection problem as an optimization problem, with the objectives of higher accuracy, lower risk (uncertainty), and lower cost. Four metrics:trustworthiness,expertise,uncertainty, andcost, are identified to measure and adjust the quality of recommenders. We focus on a 1-hop recommender selection, for which we propose the FluidTrust model to better illustrate the trust--decision making process of a user. We also discuss the extension of multihop scenarios and multitarget scenarios. Experimental results, with the real social network datasets of Epinions and Advogato, validate the effectiveness of RATE: it can predict trust with higher accuracy (it gains about 20&percnt; higher accuracy in Epinions), lower risk, and less cost (about a 30&percnt; improvement).", "authors": [{"name": "wenjun jiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=86159120757"}, {"name": "jie wu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81377591433"}, {"name": "guojun wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81549287256"}], "title": "On Selecting Recommenders for Trust Evaluation in Online Social Networks", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "128\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "29\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "128\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "china", "university": "hunan university", "affiliation_string": "hunan university p r china", "city": "changsha", "Name": "wenjun jiang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "temple university usa", "city": null, "Name": "jie wu"}, {"country": "china", "university": "central south university", "affiliation_string": "central south university p r china", "city": "changsha", "Name": "guojun wang"}]}, "Article No.: 12": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2835510", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "timothy j norman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100062550"}, {"name": "suzanne barber", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81496651230"}, {"name": "rino falcone", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100024170"}, {"name": "jie zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81340494324"}], "title": "Introduction to Theme Section on Trust in Social Networks and Systems", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "76\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "18\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "76\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of aberdeen", "affiliation_string": "department of computing science kings college university of aberdeen uk", "city": "aberdeen", "Name": "timothy j norman"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "department of electrical and computer engineering university of texas at austin tx usa", "city": "austin", "Name": "suzanne barber"}, {"country": "Lesotho", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "istc-cnr roma italy", "city": "roma", "Name": "rino falcone"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": "nanyang technological university", "affiliation_string": "school of computer engineering nanyang technological university ntu singapore", "city": "singapore", "Name": "jie zhang"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["Cristiano Castelfranchi , Rino Falcone , Giovanni Pezzulo, Trust in information sources as a source for trust: a fuzzy approach, Proceedings of the second international joint conference on Autonomous agents and multiagent systems, July 14-18, 2003, Melbourne, Australia[doi>10.1145/860575.860590]\n", "Christiano Castelfranchi , Rino Falcone, Trust Theory: A Socio-Cognitive and Computational Model, Wiley Publishing, 2010\n", "Rino Falcone , Michele Piunti , Matteo Venanzi , Cristiano Castelfranchi, From manifesta to krypta: The relevance of categories for trusting others, ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST), v.4 n.2, March 2013[doi>10.1145/2438653.2438662]\n", "Pinar Yolum , Munindar P.

In particular, we are interested in analyzing the relevance of F's category as indicator for its trustworthiness with respect to the specific informative goals of X. In this article, we analyze an interactive cognitive model for searching information in a world in which each agent can be considered as belonging to a specific agent's category. We also consider variability within the canonical categorical behavior and consequent influence on the trustworthiness of provided information. The introduced interactive cognitive model also allows evaluation of the trustworthiness of a source both on the basis of its category and on past direct experience with it, thus selecting the more adequate source with respect to the informative goals to achieve. We present a computational approach based on fuzzy sets and some selected simulation scenarios together with the discussion of their more interesting results.", "authors": [{"name": "rino falcone", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100024170"}, {"name": "alessandro sapienza", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658771077"}, {"name": "cristiano castelfranchi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409594921"}], "title": "The Relevance of Categories for Trusting Information Sources", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "75\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "15\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "75\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "rino falcone"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "alessandro sapienza"}]}}, "date": {"month": "December", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Atherton, M. 2010.

Agents who do not directly trust each other can transact through exchange of IOUs (obligations) along a chain of trust in the network. Credit networks are robust to intrusion, can enable transactions between strangers in exchange economies, and have the liquidity to support a high rate of transactions. We study the formation of such networks when agents strategically decide how much credit to extend each other. We find strong positive network formation results for the simplest theoretical model. When each agent trusts a fixed set of other agents and transacts directly only with those it trusts, all pure-strategy Nash equilibria are social optima. However, when we allow transactions over longer paths, the price of anarchy may be unbounded. On the positive side, when agents have a shared belief about the trustworthiness of each agent, simple greedy dynamics quickly converge to a star-shaped network, which is a social optimum. Similar star-like structures are found in equilibria of heuristic strategies found via simulation studies. In addition, we simulate environments where agents may have varying information about each others\u2019 trustworthiness based on their distance in a social network. Empirical game analysis of these scenarios suggests that star structures arise only when defaults are relatively rare, and otherwise, credit tends to be issued over short social distances conforming to the locality of information. Overall, we find that networks formed by self-interested agents achieve a high fraction of available value, as long as this potential value is large enough to enable any network to form.", "authors": [{"name": "pranav dandekar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81472646150"}, {"name": "ashish goel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548017481"}, {"name": "michael p wellman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81504682167"}, {"name": "bryce wiedenbeck", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81501683718"}], "title": "Strategic Formation of Credit Networks", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "238\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "238\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "stanford university", "city": null, "Name": "pranav dandekar"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "stanford university", "city": null, "Name": "ashish goel"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of michigan", "city": null, "Name": "michael p wellman"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of michigan", "city": null, "Name": "bryce wiedenbeck"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["Aiello, L.

We instead study aggregate user behavior and the retweet graph with a focus on quantitative descriptions. We find that the lifetime tweet distribution is a type-II discrete Weibull stemming from a power law hazard function, that the tweet rate distribution, although asymptotically power law, exhibits a lognormal cutoff over finite sample intervals, and that the inter-tweet interval distribution is a power law with exponential cutoff. The retweet graph is small-world and scale-free, like the social graph, but less disassortative and has much stronger clustering. These differences are consistent with it better capturing the real-world social relationships of and trust between users than the social graph. Beyond just understanding and modeling human communication patterns and social networks, applications for alternative, decentralized microblogging systems---both predicting real-word performance and detecting spam---are discussed.", "authors": [{"name": "david r bild", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81414619034"}, {"name": "yue liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81486646730"}, {"name": "robert p dick", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330490110"}, {"name": "z morley mao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658693165"}, {"name": "dan s wallach", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100639714"}], "title": "Aggregate Characterization of User Behavior in Twitter and Analysis of the Retweet Graph", "citations": [{"Name": "Yue Liu ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "David R.

However, specific characteristics of real-world resources and queries, and their impact on P2P-based RD, are largely unknown. We analyze the characteristics of resources and queries using data from four real-world systems. These characteristics are then used to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the fundamental design choices for P2P-based multi-attribute RD. The datasets exhibit several noteworthy features that affect the performance. For example, compared to uniform queries, real-world queries are relatively easier to resolve using unstructured, superpeer, and single-attribute-dominated query-based structured P2P solutions, as queries mostly specify only a small subset of the available attributes and large ranges of attribute values. However, all the solutions are prone to significant load balancing issues, as the resources and queries are highly skewed and correlated. The implications of our findings for improving RD solutions are also discussed.", "authors": [{"name": "h m n dilum bandara", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81508707906"}, {"name": "anura p jayasumana", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100282928"}], "title": "P2P-Based, Multi-Attribute Resource Discovery under Real-World Resources and Queries", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "227\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "227\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "colorado state university", "city": null, "Name": "h m n dilum bandara"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "colorado state university", "city": null, "Name": "anura p jayasumana"}]}}, "date": {"month": "February", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Peter Alvaro , Tyson Condie , Neil Conway , Khaled Elmeleegy , Joseph M.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work investigating batch medical image retrieval (BMIR) processing in a mobile wireless network environment. Four steps are incorporated in our BMIR algorithm. First, when a number of retrieval requests (i.e.,mretrieval images andmradii) are simultaneously submitted by users, then a cost-based dynamic retrieval (CDRS) scheduling procedure is invoked to efficiently and effectively identify the correlation among the retrieval spheres (requests) based on a cost model. Next, an index-based image set reduction (ISR) is performed at the execution-node level in parallel. Then, a refinement processing of the candidate images is conducted to get the answers. Finally, at the transmission-node level, the corresponding image fragment (IF) replicas are chosen based on an adaptive multi-resolution (AMR)-based IF replicas selection scheme, and transmitted to the user-node level by a priority-based IF replicas transmission (PIFT) scheme. The experimental results validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm in minimizing the response time and increasing the parallelism of I&sol;O and CPU.", "authors": [{"name": "yi zhuang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81344501156"}, {"name": "nan jiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81492650593"}, {"name": "qing li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81324491114"}, {"name": "lei chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350582990"}, {"name": "chunhua ju", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375608920"}], "title": "Progressive Batch Medical Image Retrieval Processing in Mobile Wireless Networks", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "119\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "15\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "119\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "china", "university": "zhejiang gongshang university", "affiliation_string": "zhejiang gongshang university hangzhou pr china", "city": "hangzhou", "Name": "yi zhuang"}, {"country": "China", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "hangzhou first peoples hospital pr hangzhou china", "city": "hangzhou", "Name": "nan jiang"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "city university", "affiliation_string": "city university of hong kong kowloon hksar pr china", "city": "london", "Name": "qing li"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "hong kong university of science and technology hksar pr china", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "lei chen"}, {"country": "china", "university": "zhejiang gongshang university", "affiliation_string": "zhejiang gongshang university hangzhou pr china", "city": "hangzhou", "Name": "chunhua ju"}]}}, "date": {"month": "September", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 8": {"references": ["ACLP NYU. 2012.

All online communities work hard to keep their members through various initiatives, such as personalisation and recommendation technologies. In online communities aimed at supporting behavioural change, that is, in domains such as diet, lifestyle, or the environment, the main reason for participation is not to connect with real-world friends for sharing and communicating, but to meet and gain support from like-minded people in an online environment. Introducing personalisation and recommendation features in these networks is challenging, as traditional approaches leverage the densely populated friendship relations found in typical social networks, and these are not present in these new community types. We address this challenge by looking beyond the articulated friendships of a community for evidence of relationships. In particular, we look at the interactions of members of an online community with other members and resources. In this article, we present a social behaviour model and apply it to two types of recommendation systems, a people recommender and a content recommender system. We evaluate our systems using the interaction logs of an online diet and lifestyle community in which 5,000 Australians participated in a 12-week programme. Our results show that our social behaviour-based recommendation algorithms outperform baselines, friendship-based, and link-prediction algorithms.", "authors": [{"name": "surya nepal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100296790"}, {"name": "cecile paris", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100495902"}, {"name": "payam aghaei pour", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490690980"}, {"name": "jill freyne", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548050174"}, {"name": "sanat kumar bista", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442615882"}], "title": "Interaction-Based Recommendations for Online Communities", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "308\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "26\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "308\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "csiro", "city": null, "Name": "surya nepal"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "csiro", "city": null, "Name": "cecile paris"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "csiro", "city": null, "Name": "payam aghaei pour"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "csiro", "city": null, "Name": "jill freyne"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "csiro", "city": null, "Name": "sanat kumar bista"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Akram, M.

As with any component-based system, the overall performance and quality of the system is an aggregate function of its component services. In this article, we present a novel approach for managing bottom-up faults in service-based systems. Bottom-up faults are a special case of system-wide exceptions that are defined as abnormal conditions or defects occurring in component services, which if not detected and/or managed, may lead to runtime failures. Examples of bottom-up faults include network outage, server disruption, and changes to service provisioning (e.g., new operation parameter required) that may have an impact on the way component services are consumed. We propose a soft-state signaling-based approach to propagate these faults from participants to composite services. Soft-state refers to a class of protocols where the state of a service is constantly refreshed by periodic messages, and user/service takes up the responsibility of communicating and maintaining its state. Soft-state-based protocols have a number of advantages including implicit error recovery and easier fault management, resulting in high availability for systems. Although soft-state has been widely used in various Internet protocols, this work is the first (to the best of our knowledge) to adopt soft-state for fault management in composite services.

We present a competitive distributed recommendation mechanism based on adaptive software agents for efficiently allocating the \"consumer attention space,\" or banners. In the example of an electronic shopping mall, the task is delegated to the individual shops, each of which evaluates the information that is available about the consumer and his or her interests (e.g. keywords, product queries, and available parts of a profile). Shops make a monetary bid in an auction where a limited amount of \"consumer attention space\" for the arriving consumer is sold. Each shop is represented by a software agent that bids for each consumer. This allows shops to rapidly adapt their bidding strategy to focus on consumers interested in their offerings.For various basic and simple models for on-line consumers, shops, and profiles, we demonstrate the feasibility of our system by evolutionary simulations as in the field of agent-based computational economics (ACE). We also develop adaptive software agents that learn bidding-strategies, based on neural networks and strategy exploration heuristics. Furthermore, we address the commercial and technological advantages of this distributed market-based approach. The mechanism we describe is not limited to the example of the electronic shopping mall, but can easily be extended to other domains.", "authors": [{"name": "sander m bohte", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100027053"}, {"name": "enrico gerding", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100058042"}, {"name": "han la poutre", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100620179"}], "title": "Market-based recommendation: Agents that compete for consumer attention", "citations": [{"Name": "Enrico H.

The context available to such crawlers can guide the navigation of links with the goal of efficiently locating highly relevant target pages. We developed a framework to fairly evaluate topical crawling algorithms under a number of performance metrics. Such a framework is employed here to evaluate different algorithms that have proven highly competitive among those proposed in the literature and in our own previous research. In particular we focus on the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation of the cues available to a crawler, and on adaptive crawlers that use machine learning techniques to guide their search. We find that the best performance is achieved by a novel combination of explorative and exploitative bias, and introduce an evolutionary crawler that surpasses the performance of the best nonadaptive crawler after sufficiently long crawls. We also analyze the computational complexity of the various crawlers and discuss how performance and complexity scale with available resources. Evolutionary crawlers achieve high efficiency and scalability by distributing the work across concurrent agents, resulting in the best performance/cost ratio.", "authors": [{"name": "filippo menczer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100513282"}, {"name": "gautam pant", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100223649"}, {"name": "padmini srinivasan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332529194"}], "title": "Topical web crawlers: Evaluating adaptive algorithms", "citations": [{"Name": "S.

However, there has been relatively little theoretical analysis of the conditions under which the technique is effective. To explore this issue, we analyse the <i>robustness</i> of collaborative recommendation: the ability to make recommendations despite (possibly intentional) noisy product ratings. There are two aspects to robustness: recommendation <i>accuracy</i> and <i>stability</i>. We formalize recommendation accuracy in machine learning terms and develop theoretically justified models of accuracy. In addition, we present a framework to examine recommendation stability in the context of a widely-used collaborative filtering algorithm. For each case, we evaluate our analysis using several real-world data-sets. Our investigation is both practically relevant for enterprises wondering whether collaborative recommendation leaves their marketing operations open to attack, and theoretically interesting for the light it sheds on a comprehensive theory of collaborative recommendation.", "authors": [{"name": "michael omahony", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100046081"}, {"name": "neil hurley", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100444485"}, {"name": "nicholas kushmerick", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100059962"}, {"name": "guenole silvestre", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100353324"}], "title": "Collaborative recommendation: A robustness analysis", "citations": [{"Name": "J.

In particular, we investigate the number of result pages that search engines should prepare during the query processing phase.Search engine users have been observed to browse through very few pages of results for queries that they submit. This behavior of users suggests that prefetching many results upon processing an initial query is not efficient, since most of the prefetched results will not be requested by the user who initiated the search. However, a policy that abandons result prefetching in favor of retrieving just the first page of search results might not make optimal use of system resources either.We argue that for a certain behavior of users, engines should prefetch a constant number of result pages per query. We define a concrete query processing model for search engines with segmented indices, and analyze the cost of such prefetching policies. Based on these costs, we show how to determine the constant that optimizes the prefetching policy. Our results are mostly applicable tolocal indexpartitions of the inverted files, but are also applicable to processing short queries inglobal indexarchitectures.", "authors": [{"name": "ronny lempel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100607187"}, {"name": "shlomo moran", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332516474"}], "title": "Optimizing result prefetching in web search engines with segmented indices", "citations": [{"Name": "Gholam R.

It is also possible to set up publishable aliases, which can be used by human correspondents to contact the subscriber, while being useless to harvesting robots and spammers. The validity of an alias can be easily restricted to a specific duration in time, a specific number of received messages, a specific population of senders, and/or in other ways. The system is fully compatible with the existing E-Mail infrastructure and can be immediately accessed via any standard E-Mail client software (MUA).

This complicates application programming, and may expose failures to end users. This paper presents a framework for an application-independent infrastructure that provides recovery guarantees and masks almost all system failures, thus relieving the application programmer from having to deal with these failures---by making applications \"stateless.\" The main concept is an interaction contract between two components regarding message and state preservation. The framework provides comprehensive recovery encompassing data, messages, and the states of application components. We describe techniques to reduce logging cost, allow effective log truncation, and permit independent recovery for critical components. We illustrate the framework's utility via web-based e-services scenarios. Its feasibility is demonstrated by our prototype implementation of interaction contracts based on the Apache web server and the PHP servlet engine. Finally, we discuss industrial relevance for middleware architectures such as.

We use user traversals on hyperlinks as weights to measure semantic relationships between Web pages. On the basis of these weights, we propose a novel method to put Web pages on a Web site onto different conceptual levels in a link hierarchy. We develop a clustering algorithm called PageCluster, which clusters conceptually-related pages on each conceptual level of the link hierarchy based on their in-link and out-link similarities. Clusters are then used to construct a conceptual link hierarchy, which is visualized in a prototype called Online Navigation Explorer (ONE) for adaptive Web site navigation. Our experiments show that our method can put Web pages onto conceptual levels of a link hierarchy more accurately than both the breadth-first search method and the shortest-weighted-path method, and PageCluster can cluster conceptually-related pages more accurately than the bibliographic analysis method. Our user study also shows that the conceptual link hierarchy visualized in ONE can help users find information more effectively and efficiently as the task of finding information becomes less specific and involves more Web pages on multiple conceptual levels.", "authors": [{"name": "jianhan zhu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81546402456"}, {"name": "jun hong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100649764"}, {"name": "john g hughes", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100166277"}], "title": "PageCluster: Mining conceptual link hierarchies from Web log files for adaptive Web site navigation", "citations": [{"Name": "Sang T.

In our approach, questions are transformed into new queries aimed at maximizing the probability of retrieving answers from existing information retrieval systems. The method involves automatically learning phrase features for classifying questions into different types, automatically generating candidate query transformations from a training set of question/answer pairs, and automatically evaluating the candidate transformations on target information retrieval systems such as real-world general purpose search engines. At run-time, questions are transformed into a set of queries, and reranking is performed on the documents retrieved. We present a prototype search engine,Tritus, that applies the method to Web search engines. Blind evaluation on a set of real queries from a Web search engine log shows that the method significantly outperforms the underlying search engines, and outperforms a commercial search engine specializing in question answering. Our methodology cleanly supports combining documents retrieved from different search engines, resulting in additional improvement with a system that combines search results from multiple Web search engines.", "authors": [{"name": "eugene agichtein", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100483286"}, {"name": "steve lawrence", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100574544"}, {"name": "luis gravano", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100495046"}], "title": "Learning to find answers to questions on the Web", "citations": [{"Name": "Radu Soricut ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Eric Brill", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alexandros Ntoulas ", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gerald Chao ", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Junghoo Cho", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lydia B.

In this article, we address the design of the portal page of a Web site, which serves as the homepage of a Web site or a default Web portal. We define an important research problem---hyperlink selection: selecting from a large set of hyperlinks in a given Web site, a limited number of hyperlinks for inclusion in a portal page. The objective of hyperlink selection is to maximize the efficiency, effectiveness, and usage of a Web site's portal page. We propose a heuristic approach to hyperlink selection, LinkSelector, which is based on relationships among hyperlinks---structural relationships that can be extracted from an existing Web site and access relationships that can be discovered from a Web log. We compared the performance of LinkSelector with that of the current practice of hyperlink selection (i.e., manual hyperlink selection by domain experts), using data obtained from the University of Arizona Web site. Results showed that LinkSelector outperformed the current manual selection method.", "authors": [{"name": "xiao fang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81313482892"}, {"name": "olivia r liu sheng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418596314"}], "title": "LinkSelector: A Web mining approach to hyperlink selection for Web portals", "citations": [{"Name": "Michael Chau ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiao Fang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Olivia R.

OASIS approved standard, WSRP, is an attempt to standardize the interface between the provider and the consumer of the Portlet. This initiative promotes Portlet interoperability, componentware practices, and the existence of a Portlet market. This work argues that the diversity of the settings where a Portlet might be syndicated recommends that Portlets be instrumented for variability, and this, in turn, demands a product-line approach. This work introduces a new source of variability, the \u201cinteraction lifecycle\u201d, a description of the visible flow of a Portlet, and shows how this feature can be adapted to cater to the idiosyncrasies of the hosting application. Distinct variants are identified that permit the consumer to customize the presentation, content, and links of the Portlet markup in a controlled way. The use of product-line techniques allow the consumer to cope with this variability in a cost-effective manner. The article ends by illustrating how the extensible capabilities of WSRP are used to accomodate this process.", "authors": [{"name": "oscar diaz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100278404"}, {"name": "juan j rodriguez", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100319544"}], "title": "Portlet syndication: Raising variability concerns", "citations": [{"Name": "Oscar D\u00edaz ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Salvador Trujillo ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sandy P\u00e9rez", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "B.

This investigation used a customized Web crawler to traverse 17 million Web pages from diverse geographic locations and identify nearly 30,000 streaming audio and video clips available for analysis. Using custom-built extraction tools, these streaming media objects were analyzed to determine attributes such as media type, encoding format, playout duration, bitrate, resolution, and codec. The streaming media content encountered is dominated by proprietary audio and video formats with the top four commercial products being RealPlayer, Windows Media Player, MP3 and QuickTime. The distribution of the stored playout durations of streaming audio and video clips are long-tailed. More than half of the streaming media clips encountered are video, encoded primarily for broadband connections and at resolutions considerably smaller than the resolutions of typical monitors.", "authors": [{"name": "mingzhe li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81381602704"}, {"name": "mark claypool", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100573611"}, {"name": "robert kinicki", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100331672"}, {"name": "james nichols", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100204760"}], "title": "Characteristics of streaming media stored on the Web", "citations": [{"Name": "Patrick Pegus", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "II ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Emmanuel Cecchet ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Prashant Shenoy", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Seung-Bum Lee ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alan F.

To realize effective Web content delivery for users, two kinds of application-level QoS policies, transmission time and transmission order of inline objects, are introduced. Next, we define a language to specify these policies. We show that transmission order control can be implemented using HTTP/1.1 pipelined requests in which a client recognizes the transmission order description in a Web page and simulates parallel transmission of inline objects by HTTP/1.1 range requests. Experimental results show that our proposed mechanism realizes effective content delivery to a diverse group of Internet users. Finally, we introduce two methods to specify application-level QoS policies, one by content authors, and the other by end users.", "authors": [{"name": "kaname harumoto", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100608759"}, {"name": "tadashi nakano", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81327490831"}, {"name": "shinya fukumura", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309507188"}, {"name": "shinji shimojo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100391341"}, {"name": "shojiro nishio", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100649235"}], "title": "Effective Web browsing through content delivery adaptation", "citations": [{"Name": "Chris Harrison ", "Country": "georgia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Anind K.

However, when the users are connected by the Internet, bandwidth limitation and network latency may seriously affect the performance and the interactivity of the system. This explains why there are very few DVE applications for the Internet. To address these shortcomings, caching and prefetching techniques are usually employed. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of these techniques depends largely on the accuracy of the prediction method used. Although there are a few methods proposed for predicting 3D motion, most of them are primarily designed for predicting the motion of specific objects by assuming certain object motion behaviors. We notice that in desktop DVE applications, such as virtual walkthrough and network gaming, the 2D mouse is still the most popular device used for navigation input. Through studying the motion behavior of a mouse during 3D navigation, we have developed a hybrid motion model for predicting the mouse motion during such navigation---a linear model for prediction at low-velocity motion and an elliptic model for prediction at high-velocity motion. The predicted mouse motion velocity is then mapped to the 3D environment for predicting the user's 3D motion. We describe how this prediction method can be integrated into the caching and prefetching mechanisms of our DVE prototype. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and the resulting caching and prefetching mechanisms through extensive experiments.", "authors": [{"name": "addison chan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100177546"}, {"name": "rynson w h lau", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451597133"}, {"name": "beatrice ng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100470941"}], "title": "Motion prediction for caching and prefetching in mouse-driven DVE navigation", "citations": [{"Name": "Rynson W.

Due to its reliance on the strongly typed, purely functional programming language Haskell as a host language, it is highly flexible and---at the same time---it provides extensive guarantees due to its pervasive use of type information.WASH/CGI can be structured into a number of sublanguages addressing different aspects of the application. Thedocument sublanguageprovides tools for the generation of parameterized XHTML documents and forms. Its typing guarantees that almost all generated documents are valid XHTML documents. Thesession sublanguageprovides a session abstraction with a transparent notion of session state and allows the composition of documents and Web forms to entire interactive scripts. Both are integrated with thewidget sublanguagewhich describes the communication (parameter passing) between client and server. It imposes a simple type discipline on the parameters that guarantees that forms posted by the client are always understood by the server. That is, the server never asks for data not submitted by the client and the data submitted by the client has the type requested by the server. In addition, parameters are received in their typed internal representation, not as strings. Finally, thepersistence sublanguagedeals with managing shared state on the server side as well as individual state on the client side. It presents shared state as an abstract data type, where the script can control whether it wants to observe mutations due to concurrently executing scripts. It guarantees that states from different interaction threads cannot be confused.", "authors": [{"name": "peter thiemann", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100458917"}], "title": "An embedded domain-specific language for type-safe server-side web scripting", "citations": [{"Name": "Gautam Upadhyaya ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Vijay S.

Generally, these contracts enumerate agents authorized to participate in transactions, and spell out such things like rights and obligations of each partner, and terms and conditions of the trade. An enterprise may be concurrently bound by a set of different contracts that regulate the trading relations with its various clients and suppliers. This set is dynamic because new contracts are constantly being established, and previously established contracts end, are annulled, or revised.We argue that existent access control mechanisms cannot adequately support the large number of regulations embedded in disparate, evolving contracts. To deal with this problem we propose to use certified policies. A certified policy (CP) is obtained by expressing contract terms regarding access and control regulations in a formal, interpretable language, and by having them digitally signed by a proper authority. In this framework, an agent making a request to a server presents to the server such a CP, together with other relevant credentials. A valid certified policy can then be used as the authorization policy for the request in question.It is the thesis of this article that this approach would make several aspects of contract enforcement more manageable and more efficient: (a) deployment---certified policies may be stored on certificate repositories from where they can be retrieved as needed, (b) annulment---if a contract is annulled, the corresponding CP should be invalidated; the latter can be conveniently supported by certificate revocation, and (c) revision---revision of contract terms can be done by publishing a new certified policy and by revoking the old one. The proposed approach is practical in that it does not require any modification of the current certificate infrastructure and only minor modifications to servers.In this article, we propose a language for stating contract terms and present several formal examples of certified policies. We describe the implementation of the enforcement mechanism and present experimental performance results.", "authors": [{"name": "victoria ungureanu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100061334"}], "title": "Using certified policies to regulate E-commerce transactions", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "23\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "1463\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "rutgers university", "city": null, "Name": "victoria ungureanu"}]}, "Pages: 92-128": {"references": ["Krishna Bharat , Monika R.

To address such issues, highly configurable infrastructures are needed.In this article, we describe Seta2000, an infrastructure for the development of recommender systems that support personalized interactions with their users and are accessible from different types of devices (e.g., desktop computers and mobile phones). The Seta2000 infrastructure offers a built-in recommendation engine, based on a multi-agent architecture. Moreover, the infrastructure supports the integration of heterogeneous software and the development of agents that can be configured to offer specialized facilities within a recommender system, but also to dynamically enable and disable such facilities, depending on the requirements of the application domain. The Seta2000 infrastructure has been exploited to develop two prototypes: SeTA is an adaptive Web store personalizing the recommendation and presentation of products in the Web.

Recently, many XML storage models have been proposed to manage XML data. In order to assess an XML database's abilities to deal with XML queries, several benchmarks have also been proposed, including XMark and XMach. However, no reported studies using those benchmarks were found that can provide users with insights on the impacts of a variety of storage models on XML query performance. In this article, we report our first set of results on benchmarking a set of XML database implementations using two XML benchmarks. The selected implementations represent a wide range of approaches, including RDBMS-based systems with document-independent and document-dependent XML-relational schema mapping approaches, and XML native engines based on an Object-Oriented Model and the Document Object Model. Comprehensive experiments were conducted to study relative performance of different approaches and the important issues that affect XML query performance, such as path expression query processing, effectiveness of various partitioning, label-path, and indexing structures.", "authors": [{"name": "hongjun lu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451594025"}, {"name": "jeffrey xu yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81447600785"}, {"name": "guoren wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81416601794"}, {"name": "shihui zheng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452598086"}, {"name": "haifeng jiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452602730"}, {"name": "ge yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409596515"}, {"name": "aoying zhou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100264932"}], "title": "What makes the differences: benchmarking XML database implementations", "citations": [{"Name": "Erwin Leonardi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sourav S.

However, in an electronic negotiation setting in which the parties involved are often unknown to (and therefore lack information about) each other, this learning has to be accomplished with only the bid offers submitted during an ongoing negotiation. In this article, we consider such a scenario and develop learning algorithms for electronic agents that use a common negotiation tactic, namely, the time-dependent tactic (TDT), in which the values of the negotiating issues are dependent on the time elapsed in the negotiation. Learning algorithms for this tactic have not been proposed in the literature. Our approach is based on using the derivatives of the Taylor's series approximation of the TDT function in a three-phase algorithm that enumerates over a partial discretized version of the solution space. Computational results with our algorithms are encouraging.", "authors": [{"name": "wilson wai ho mok", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100247252"}, {"name": "r p sundarraj", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100061554"}], "title": "Learning algorithms for single-instance electronic negotiations using the time-dependent behavioral tactic", "citations": [{"Name": "Rahmatollah Beheshti ", "Country": "oman", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nasser Mozayani", "Country": "oman", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "HOMAN", "Country": "oman", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "a learning based negotiation method for holonic multi-agent systems", "Country": "oman", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Raymond Y.

The seminal papers of Kleinberg [1998, 1999] and Brin and Page [1998] introducedLink Analysis Ranking, where hyperlink structures are used to determine the relativeauthorityof a Web page and produce improved algorithms for the ranking of Web search results. In this article we work within the hubs and authorities framework defined by Kleinberg and we propose new families of algorithms. Two of the algorithms we propose use a Bayesian approach, as opposed to the usual algebraic and graph theoretic approaches. We also introduce a theoretical framework for the study of Link Analysis Ranking algorithms. The framework allows for the definition of specific properties of Link Analysis Ranking algorithms, as well as for comparing different algorithms. We study the properties of the algorithms that we define, and we provide an axiomatic characterization of the INDEGREE heuristic which ranks each node according to the number of incoming links. We conclude the article with an extensive experimental evaluation. We study the quality of the algorithms, and we examine how different structures in the graphs affect their performance.", "authors": [{"name": "allan borodin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100625769"}, {"name": "gareth o roberts", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100585891"}, {"name": "jeffrey s rosenthal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100271559"}, {"name": "panayiotis tsaparas", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100152625"}], "title": "Link analysis ranking: algorithms, theory, and experiments", "citations": [{"Name": "Xiaoxin Yin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jiawei Han ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Philip S.

Statistics cover the number and domain distribution of sites; the number, type and size distribution of text documents; and the linkage structure of this Web. We also show how crawling constraints and abnormal situations on the Web can influence the statistics.", "authors": [{"name": "daniel gomes", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100102620"}, {"name": "mario j silva", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100060665"}], "title": "Characterizing a national community web", "citations": [{"Name": "Lu\u00eds Costa", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Question answering beyond CLEF document collections", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Diana Santos ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nuno Cardoso", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Portuguese at CLEF 2005", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lulwah M.

One of the key problems in coordinated enroute Web caching is to compute the locations for storing copies of an object among the enroute caches so that some specified objectives are achieved. In this article, we address this problem for tree networks, and formulate it as a maximization problem. We consider this problem for both unconstrained and constrained cases. The constrained case includes constraints on the cost gain per node and on the number of object copies to be placed. We present dynamic programming-based solutions to this problem for different cases and theoretically show that the solutions are either optimal or convergent to optimal solutions. We derive efficient algorithms that produce these solutions. Based on our mathematical model, we also present a solution to coordinated enroute Web caching for autonomous systems as a natural extension of the solution for tree networks. We implement our algorithms and evaluate our model on different performance metrics through extensive simulation experiments. The implementation results show that our methods outperform the existing algorithms of either coordinated enroute Web caching for linear topology or object placement (replacement) at individual nodes only.", "authors": [{"name": "keqiu li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409597850"}, {"name": "hong shen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81327491417"}, {"name": "francis y l chin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452595690"}, {"name": "si qing zheng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452598080"}], "title": "Optimal methods for coordinated enroute web caching for tree networks", "citations": [{"Name": "Keqiu Li ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hong Shen ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Francis Y.

NEWS detects flash crowds from performance degradation in responses and mitigates flash crowds by admitting incoming requests adaptively. We evaluate NEWS performance with both simulations and testbed experiments. We first investigate a network-limited scenarion in simulations. We find that NEWS detects flash crowds within 20 seconds. By discarding 32&percent; of incoming requests, NEWS protects the target server and networks from overloading, reducing the response packet drop rate from 25&percent; to 2&percent;. For admitted requests, NEWS increases their response rate by two times. This performance is similar to the best static rate limiter deployed in the same scenario. We also investigate the impact of detection intervals on NEWS performance, showing it affects both detection delay and false alarm rate. We further consider a server memory-limited scenario in testbed experiments, confirming that NEWS is also effective in this case. We also examine the runtime cost of NEWS traffic monitoring in practice and find that it consumes little CPU time and relatively small memory. Finally, we show NEWS effectively protects bystander traffic from flash crowds.", "authors": [{"name": "xuan chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100107728"}, {"name": "john heidemann", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100132058"}], "title": "Flash crowd mitigation via adaptive admission control based on application-level observations", "citations": [{"Name": "Jean Botev ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Steffen Rothkugel", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ubiratam de Paula Junior ", "Country": "spain", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "L\u00facia M.

Web service standards, based on WSDL (Web Service Definition Language), have been adopted as process-to-process communication paradigms. However, the conceptual modeling of applications using Web services has not yet been addressed. Interaction with Web services is often specified at the level of the source code; thus, Web service interfaces are buried within a programmatic specification.In this article, we argue that Web services should be considered first-class citizens in the specification of Web applications. Thus, service-enabled Web applications should benefit from the high-level modeling and automatic code generation techniques that have long been advocated for Web application design and implementation. To this end, we extend a declarative model for specifying data-intensive Web applications in two directions: (i) high-level modeling of Web services and their interactions with the Web applications which use them, and (ii) modeling and specification of Web applications implementing new, complex Web services.Our approach is fully implemented within a CASE tool allowing the high-level modeling and automatic deployment of service-enabled Web applications.", "authors": [{"name": "ioana manolescu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100402995"}, {"name": "marco brambilla", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100555834"}, {"name": "stefano ceri", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100606078"}, {"name": "sara comai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100517618"}, {"name": "piero fraternali", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100158817"}], "title": "Model-driven design and deployment of service-enabled web applications", "citations": [{"Name": "Stefano Ceri ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marco Brambilla ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Emanuele Valle", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Design Abstractions for Innovative Web Applications: The Case of the SOA Augmented with Semantics", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marta Ruiz ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Vicente Pelechano ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "\u00d3scar Pastor", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Designing web services for supporting user tasks: a model driven approach", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marko Ribari\u0107 ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dragan Ga\u0161evi\u0107 ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Milan Milanovi\u0107 ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Adrian Giurca ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sergey Lukichev ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gerd Wagner", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Model-Driven Engineering of Rules for Web Services", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Roberto Acerbis ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Aldo Bongio ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marco Brambilla ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Stefano Butti", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marco Brambilla ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Stefano Butti ", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Piero Fraternali", "Country": "austria", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Oscar D\u00edaz ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Arantza Irastorza ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Maider Azanza ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Felipe M.

This is done by adding machine understandable content to Web resources. Such added content is called metadata, whose semantics is provided by referring to an ontology---a domain's conceptualization agreed upon by a community. The Semantic Web relies on the complex interaction of several technologies involving ontologies. Therefore, sophisticated Semantic Web applications typically comprise more than one software module. Instead of coming up with proprietary solutions, developers should be able to rely on a generic infrastructure for application development in this context. We call such an infrastructure Application Server for the Semantic Web whose design and development are based on existing Application Servers. However, we apply and augment their underlying concepts for use in the Semantic Web and integrate semantic technology within the server itself. The article discusses requirements and design issues of such a server, presents our implementation KAON SERVER and demonstrates its usefulness by a detailed scenario.", "authors": [{"name": "daniel oberle", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100285360"}, {"name": "steffen staab", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409593685"}, {"name": "rudi studer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100311749"}, {"name": "raphael volz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100324489"}], "title": "Supporting application development in the semantic web", "citations": [{"Name": "Yevgen Biletskiy ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Girish R.

For example, e-mail abuse is rampant because sending an e-mail has negligible cost for the sender. It has been suggested that such abuse may be discouraged by introducing an artificial cost in the form of a moderately expensive computation. Thus, the sender of an e-mail might be required to pay by computing for a few seconds before the e-mail is accepted. Unfortunately, because of sharp disparities across computer systems, this approach may be ineffective against malicious users with high-end systems, prohibitively slow for legitimate users with low-end systems, or both. Starting from this observation, we research moderately hard functions that most recent systems will evaluate at about the same speed. For this purpose, we rely on memory-bound computations. We describe and analyze a family of moderately hard, memory-bound functions, and we explain how to use them for protecting against abuses.", "authors": [{"name": "martin abadi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100547147"}, {"name": "mike burrows", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100440097"}, {"name": "mark manasse", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100505299"}, {"name": "ted wobber", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81336493783"}], "title": "Moderately hard, memory-bound functions", "citations": [{"Name": "Rick Wash ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jeffrey K.

Complex Web pages are constructed from simpler fragments. Fragments may recursively embed other fragments. Relationships between Web pages and fragments are represented by object dependence graphs. We present algorithms for efficiently detecting and updating Web pages affected after one or more fragments change. We also present algorithms for publishing sets of Web pages consistently; different algorithms are used depending upon the consistency requirements.Our publishing system provides an easy method for Web site designers to specify and modify inclusion relationships among Web pages and fragments.

In QURSED, aQFRis formally described by its query set specification (QSS) which captures the complex query and reportingcapabilitiesof theQFRand the associations of the query set specification with visual elements that implement these capabilities on a Web page. The design-time component of QURSED, called QURSED Editor, semi-automates the development of the query set specification and its association with visual elements by translating intuitive visual actions taken by a developer into appropriate specificationfragments. The run-time component of QURSED produces XQuery statements by synthesizing fragments from the query set specification that have been activated during the interaction of the end-user with theQFRand renders the query results in interactive reports as specified by theQSS. We describe the techniques and algorithms employed by QURSED with emphasis on how it accommodates the intricacies introduced by the semistructured nature of the underlying data. We present the formal model of the query set specification, as well as its generation via the QURSED Editor, and focus on the techniques and heuristics the Editor employs for translating visual designer input into meaningful specifications. We also present the algorithms QURSED employs for query generation and report generation.

The task of management is to allocate data across individual cache databases and to route queries to the appropriate databases for execution. The goal is to maximize effective cache capacity and to minimize synchronization cost. We propose an affinity-based management system for main memory database cLUsters (ALBUM). ALBUM executes each query in two stages in order to take advantage of thequery affinitythat is observed in a wide range of applications. We evaluate the data/query distribution strategy in ALBUM with a set of trace-based simulations. The results show that ALBUM reduces cache miss ratio by a factor of 1.7 to 9 over alternative strategies. We have implemented a prototype of ALBUM, and compare its performance to that of an existing infrastructure: a fully replicated database with large buffer cache. The results show that ALBUM outperforms the existing infrastructure with the same number of server machines by a factor of 2 to 7, and that ALBUM with only 1/3 to 1/2 of the server machines achieves the same throughput as the existing infrastructure.", "authors": [{"name": "minwen ji", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81543877156"}], "title": "Affinity-based management of main memory database clusters", "citations": [{"Name": "L\u00e1saro Camargos ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fernando Pedone ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marcin Wieloch", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Amitabha Bagchi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Amitabh Chaudhary ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michael T.

In this context, algorithms that use and exploit structural information about the Web perform better than generic methods in both efficiency and reliability.We present an extensive characterization of the graph structure of the Web, with a view to enabling high-performance applications that make use of this structure. In particular, we show that the Web emerges as the outcome of a number of essentially independent stochastic processes that evolve at various scales. A striking consequence of this scale invariance is that the structure of the Web is \"fractal\"---cohesive subregions display the same characteristics as the Web at large. An understanding of this underlying fractal nature is therefore applicable to designing data services across multiple domains and scales.We describe potential applications of this line of research to optimized algorithm design for Web-scale data analysis.", "authors": [{"name": "stephen dill", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100341035"}, {"name": "ravi kumar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100382445"}, {"name": "kevin s mccurley", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100286563"}, {"name": "sridhar rajagopalan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100428537"}, {"name": "d sivakumar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100106716"}, {"name": "andrew tomkins", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100269271"}], "title": "Self-similarity in the web", "citations": [{"Name": "Oliver Lehmberg ", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Robert Meusel ", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Christian Bizer", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Raffaele Quitadamo ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Franco Zambonelli", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marco Bressan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Luca Pretto", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mark R.

Server-driven consistency protocols appear particularly attractive for large-scale dynamic Web workloads because dynamically generated data can change rapidly and unpredictably. However, there have been few reports on engineering server-driven consistency for such workloads. This article reports our experience in engineering server-driven consistency for a sporting and event Web site hosted by IBM, one of the most popular sites on the Internet for the duration of the event. We also examine an e-commerce site for a national retail store. Our study focuses on scalability and cachability of dynamic content. To assess scalability, we measure both the amount of state that a server needs to maintain to ensure consistency and the bursts of load in sending out invalidation messages when a popular object is modified. We find that server-driven protocols can cap the size of the server's state to a given amount without significant performance costs, and can smooth the bursts of load with minimal impact on the consistency guarantees. To improve performance, we systematically investigate several design issues for which prior research has suggested widely different solutions, including whether servers should send invalidations to idle clients. Finally, we quantify the performance impact of caching dynamic data with server-driven consistency protocols and the benefits of server-driven consistency protocols for large-scale dynamic Web services. We find that (i) caching dynamically generated data can increase cache hit rates by up to 10&percnt;, compared to the systems that do not cache dynamically generated data; and (ii) server-driven consistency protocols can increase cache hit rates by a factor of 1.5-3 for large-scale dynamic Web services, compared to client polling protocols. We have implemented a prototype of a server-driven consistency protocol based on our findings by augmenting the popular Squid cache.", "authors": [{"name": "jian yin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81539856956"}, {"name": "lorenzo alvisi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100140407"}, {"name": "mike dahlin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100513966"}, {"name": "arun iyengar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100527643"}], "title": "Engineering web cache consistency", "citations": [{"Name": "Kam-Yiu Lam ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chris C.

Generating Web pages dynamically in dialog\r\nwith the client has the advantage of providing up-to-date and\r\ntailor-made information. The development of systems for\r\nconstructing such dynamic Web services has emerged as a whole new\r\nresearch area.The <bigwig> language is designed by analyzing its\r\napplication domain and identifying fundamental aspects of Web\r\nservices inspired by problems and solutions in existing Web service\r\ndevelopment languages. The core of the design consists of a\r\nsession-centered service model together with a flexible\r\ntemplate-based mechanism for dynamic Web page construction. Using\r\nspecialized program analyses, certain Web-specific properties are\r\nverified at compile time, for instance that only valid HTML 4.01 is\r\never shown to the clients. In addition, the design provides\r\nhigh-level solutions to form field validation, caching of dynamic\r\npages, and temporal-logic based concurrency control, and it\r\nproposes syntax macros for making highly domain-specific\r\nlanguages.The language is implemented via widely available Web\r\ntechnologies, such as Apache on the server-side and JavaScript and\r\nJava Applets on the client-side.

The modern Web architecture emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. In this article we introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style, developed as an abstract model of the Web architecture and used to guide our redesign and definition of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifiers. We describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. We then compare the abstract model to the currently deployed Web architecture in order to elicit mismatches between the existing protocols and the applications they are intended to support.", "authors": [{"name": "roy t fielding", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100283787"}, {"name": "richard n taylor", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452609528"}], "title": "Principled design of the modern Web architecture", "citations": [{"Name": "Rosa Alarc\u00f3n ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Erik Wilde", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Scott Rich", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alexandros Marinos ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Erik Wilde ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jiannan Lu", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Erik Wilde ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Robert J.

It leverages standard Internet technologies, notably XML, XPath, and XLink. xlinkit can be used as part of a consistency management scheme or in applications that require smart link generation, including portal construction and management of large document repositories.

Publius has the property that it is very difficult for any adversary to censor or modify the content. In addition, the identity of the publisher is protected once the content is posted.

The goal in solving this performance problem is to achieve minimal average response time for customer requests, and thus ultimately achieve maximal customer throughput. The article decouples the overall problem into two related but distinct mathematical subproblems, one static and one dynamic. We believe this natural decoupling is one of the major contributions of our article. Thestaticcomponent algorithm determines good assignments of sites to potentially overlapping servers. These cluster assignments, which, due to overhead, cannot be changed too frequently, have a major effect on achievable response time. Additionally, these assignments must be palatable to the sites themselves. Thedynamiccomponent algorithm is designed to handle real-time load balancing by routing customer requests from the network dispatcher to the servers. This algorithm must react to fluctuating customer request load while respecting the assignments of sites to servers determined by the static component.

The most common design and implementation techniques for each of these components are presented. For this presentation we draw from the literature and from our own experimental search engine testbed. Emphasis is on introducing the fundamental concepts and the results of several performance analyses we conducted to compare different designs.", "authors": [{"name": "arvind arasu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100338523"}, {"name": "junghoo cho", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100372160"}, {"name": "hector garcia-molina", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100308969"}, {"name": "andreas paepcke", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100130120"}, {"name": "sriram raghavan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81410594516"}], "title": "Searching the Web", "citations": [{"Name": "Nuno Cardoso ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "M\u00e1rio J.
