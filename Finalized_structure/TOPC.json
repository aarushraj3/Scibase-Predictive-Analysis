A popular and effective way to extend fork-join parallelism is to allow threads to create futures. A thread creates a future to hold the results of a computation, which may or may not be executed in parallel. That result is returned when some thread touches that future, blocking if necessary until the result is ready.Recent research has shown that although futures can, of course, enhance parallelism in a structured way, they can have a deleterious effect on cache locality. In the worst case, futures can incur \u03a9(PT\u221e+tT\u221e) deviations, which implies \u03a9 (CPT&infty;+CtT&infty;) additional cache misses, whereCis the number of cache lines,Pis the number of processors,tis the number of touches, andT\u221eis the computation span. Since cache locality has a large impact on software performance on modern multicores, this result is troubling.In this article, we show that if futures are used in a simple, disciplined way, then the situation is much better: if each future is touched only once, either by the thread that created it or by a later descendant of the thread that created it, then parallel executions with work stealing can incur at mostO(CPT2&infty;) additional cache misses\u2014a substantial improvement. This structured use of futures is characteristic of many (but not all) parallel applications.", "authors": [{"name": "maurice herlihy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100151794"}, {"name": "zhiyu liu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81552264056"}], "title": "Well-Structured Futures and Cache Locality", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": 0, "Downloads (6 weeks) ": 0, "Downloads (cumulative)": 0, "Citation Count": 0}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "brown university rhode island usa", "city": null, "Name": "maurice herlihy"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "brown university rhode island usa", "city": null, "Name": "zhiyu liu"}]}, "Article No.: 25": {"references": ["George Alm\u00e1si, Barnaby Dalton, Lawrence L.

It is based on the Asynchronous Partitioned Global Address Space (APGAS) programming model, supporting the same fine-grained concurrency mechanisms within and across shared-memory nodes.We demonstrate that X10 delivers solid performance at petascale by running (weak scaling) eight application kernels on an IBM Power--775 supercomputer utilizing up to 55,680 Power7 cores (for 1.7Pflop/s of theoretical peak performance). For the four HPC Class 2 Challenge benchmarks, X10 achieves 41&percnt; to 87&percnt; of the system\u2019s potential at scale (as measured by IBM\u2019s HPCC Class 1 optimized runs).

We have gathered 49 buggy concurrent software benchmarks, drawn from public code bases, which we callSCTBench. We applied a modified version of an existing concurrency testing tool to SCTBench, testing five controlled scheduling techniques: depth-first search, preemption bounding, delay bounding, a controlled random scheduler, and probabilistic concurrency testing (PCT). We attempt to answer several research questions: Which technique performs the best, in terms of bug finding ability? How effective are the two main schedule bounding techniques\u2014preemption bounding and delay bounding\u2014at finding bugs? What challenges are associated with applying concurrency testing techniques to existing code? Can we classify certain benchmarks as trivial or nontrivial? Overall, we found that PCT (with parameterd&equals; 3) was the most effective technique in terms of bug finding; it found all bugs found by the other techniques, plus an additional three, and it missed only one bug. Surprisingly, we found that the naive controlled random scheduler, which randomly chooses one thread to execute at each scheduling point, performs well, finding more bugs than preemption bounding and just two fewer bugs than delay bounding. Our findings confirm that delay bounding is superior to preemption bounding and that schedule bounding is superior to an unbounded depth-first search. The majority of bugs in SCTBench can be exposed using a small schedule bound (1--2), supporting previous claims, although one benchmark requires five preemptions. We found that the need to remove nondeterminism and control all synchronization (as is required forsystematicconcurrency testing) can be nontrivial. There were eight distinct programs that could not easily be included in out study, such as those that perform network and interprocess communication. We report various properties about the benchmarks tested, such as the fact that the bugs in 18 benchmarks were exposed 50&percnt; of the time when using random scheduling. We note that future work should not use the benchmarks that we classify as trivial when presenting new techniques, other than as a minimum baseline. We have made SCTBench and our tools publicly available for reproducibility and use in future work.", "authors": [{"name": "paul thomson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81549015856"}, {"name": "alastair f donaldson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81318493370"}, {"name": "adam betts", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314480874"}], "title": "Concurrency Testing Using Controlled Schedulers: An Empirical Study", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": 0, "Downloads (6 weeks) ": 0, "Downloads (cumulative)": 0, "Citation Count": 0}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "imperial college london", "affiliation_string": "imperial college london london uk", "city": "london", "Name": "paul thomson"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "imperial college london", "affiliation_string": "imperial college london london uk", "city": "london", "Name": "alastair f donaldson"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "imperial college london", "affiliation_string": "imperial college london london uk", "city": "london", "Name": "adam betts"}]}, "Article No.: 26": {"references": ["L Allison , T I Dix, A bit-string longest-common-subsequence algorithm, Information Processing Letters, v.23 n.6, p.305-310, Dec. 3, 1986\n", "Srinivas Aluru , Natsuhiko Futamura , Kishan Mehrotra, Parallel biological sequence comparison using prefix computations, Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, v.63 n.3, p.264-272, March 2003[doi>10.1016/S0743-7315(03)00010-8]\n", "Alberto Apostolico , Mikhail J.

The methods presented in this article provide additional parallelism allowing multiple stages to be computed in parallel despite dependencies among them. The correctness and the performance of the algorithm relies on rank convergence properties of matrix multiplication in the tropical semiring, formed with plus as the multiplicative operation and max as the additive operation.This article demonstrates the efficiency of the parallel algorithm by showing significant speedups on a variety of important dynamic programming problems. In particular, the parallel Viterbi decoder is up to 24\u00d7 faster (with 64 processors) than a highly optimized commercial baseline.", "authors": [{"name": "saeed maleki", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81496643855"}, {"name": "madanlal musuvathi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81488665482"}, {"name": "todd mytkowicz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100300026"}], "title": "Low-Rank Methods for Parallelizing Dynamic Programming Algorithms", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": 0, "Downloads (6 weeks) ": 0, "Downloads (cumulative)": 0, "Citation Count": 0}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of illinois at urbana-champaign", "city": null, "Name": "saeed maleki"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research", "city": null, "Name": "madanlal musuvathi"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research", "city": null, "Name": "todd mytkowicz"}]}, "Article No.: 27": {"references": ["Yucel Aydogan , Craig B.

Although users often treat such interconnects as replacements of nonblocking crossbar switches that can carry out any permutation communication without contention, the networking capability of such interconnects without a centralized controller in computer communication environments is not well understood. In this article, we investigate nonblocking two-level folded-Clos networks with deterministic single-path routing, but no centralized controller, and establish the nonblocking condition. The results indicate that nonblocking two-level folded-Clos networks without a centralized controller are much more expensive to construct than the traditional nonblocking networks in the telecommunication environment. Practical two-level folded-Clos based interconnects are blocking. For such interconnects, we establish the lower bound for worst-case contention for permutations with any deterministic single-path routing scheme, show that existing routing schemes perform poorly in terms of worst-case contention for permutations, present a routing scheme that achieves the theoretical optimal, and empirically compare the performance of existing schemes with the optimal routing scheme. The techniques developed for two-level folded-Clos networks are further extended for the general fat-trees of any heights.", "authors": [{"name": "xin yuan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332537520"}, {"name": "wickus nienaber", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81371594593"}, {"name": "santosh mahapatra", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490683860"}], "title": "On Folded-Clos Networks with Deterministic Single-Path Routing", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": 0, "Downloads (6 weeks) ": 0, "Downloads (cumulative)": 0, "Citation Count": 0}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "florida state university tallahassee fl", "city": "tallahassee", "Name": "xin yuan"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "florida state university tallahassee fl", "city": "tallahassee", "Name": "wickus nienaber"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "florida state university tallahassee fl", "city": "tallahassee", "Name": "santosh mahapatra"}]}, "Article No.: 24": {"references": ["Jose L.

On cache-coherent shared-memory processors, synchronization efficiency is ultimately limited by the performance of the underlying cache coherence protocol. This article studies how hardware support for message passing can improve synchronization performance. Considering the ubiquitous problem of mutual exclusion, we devise novel algorithms for (i) classic locking, where application threads obtain exclusive access to a shared resource prior to executing their critical sections (CSes), and (ii) delegation, where CSes are executed by special threads. For classic locking, ourHybLockalgorithm uses a mix of shared memory and hardware message passing, which introduces the idea of hybrid synchronization algorithms. For delegation, we proposemp-serverandHybComb: the former is a straightforward adaptation of the server approach to hardware message passing, whereas the latter is a novel hybrid combining algorithm. Evaluation on Tilera's TILE-Gx processor shows thatHybLockoutperforms the best known classic locks. Furthermore,mp-servercan execute contended CSes with unprecedented throughput, as stalls related to cache coherence are removed from the critical path.HybCombcan achieve comparable performance while avoiding the need to dedicate server cores. Consequently, our queue and stack implementations, based on the new synchronization algorithms, largely outperform their most efficient shared-memory-only counterparts.", "authors": [{"name": "darko petrovic", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81501662971"}, {"name": "thomas ropars", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384608300"}, {"name": "andre schiper", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100234296"}], "title": "Leveraging Hardware Message Passing for Efficient Thread Synchronization", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": 0, "Downloads (6 weeks) ": 0, "Downloads (cumulative)": 0, "Citation Count": 0}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "france", "university": "ecole polytechnique", "affiliation_string": "ecole polytechnique federale de lausanne epfl switzerland", "city": "palaiseau", "Name": "darko petrovic"}, {"country": "france", "university": "ecole polytechnique", "affiliation_string": "ecole polytechnique federale de lausanne epfl switzerland", "city": "palaiseau", "Name": "thomas ropars"}, {"country": "france", "university": "ecole polytechnique", "affiliation_string": "ecole polytechnique federale de lausanne epfl switzerland", "city": "palaiseau", "Name": "andre schiper"}]}, "Article No.: 28": {"references": ["Marco Aldinucci , Massimiliano Meneghin , Massimo Torquati, Efficient Smith-Waterman on Multi-core with FastFlow, Proceedings of the 2010 18th Euromicro Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Network-based Processing, p.195-199, February 17-19, 2010[doi>10.1109/PDP.2010.93]\n", "S.

Many implementations of biological sequence alignment algorithms have been proposed for multicores, GPUs, FPGAs and CellBEs. These implementations are platform-specific; porting them to other systems requires considerable programming effort. This article proposes and evaluates MASA, a flexible and customizable software architecture that enables the execution of biological sequence alignment applications with three variants (local, global, and semiglobal) in multiple hardware/software platforms with block pruning, which is able to reduce significantly the amount of data processed. To attain our flexibility goals, we also propose a generic version of block pruning and developed multiple parallelization strategies as building blocks, including a new asynchronous dataflow-based parallelization, which may be combined to implement efficient aligners in different platforms. We provide four MASA aligner implementations for multicores (OmpSs and OpenMP), GPU (CUDA), and Intel Phi (OpenMP), showing that MASA is very flexible. The evaluation of our generic block pruning strategy shows that it significantly outperforms the previously proposed block pruning, being able to prune up to 66.5&percnt; of the cells when using the new dataflow-based parallelization strategy.", "authors": [{"name": "edans f de o sandes", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658987330"}, {"name": "guillermo miranda", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87258621557"}, {"name": "xavier martorell", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100528207"}, {"name": "eduard ayguade", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100439790"}, {"name": "george teodoro", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309491574"}, {"name": "alba c m a de melo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323489100"}], "title": "MASA: A Multiplatform Architecture for Sequence Aligners with Block Pruning", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": 0, "Downloads (6 weeks) ": 0, "Downloads (cumulative)": 0, "Citation Count": 0}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Brazil", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "department of computer science university of brasilia brazil cep", "city": "brasilia", "Name": "edans f de o sandes"}, {"country": "spain", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "barcelona supercomputing center spain", "city": null, "Name": "guillermo miranda"}, {"country": "spain", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "barcelona supercomputing center and universitat politecnica de catalunya spain", "city": null, "Name": "xavier martorell"}, {"country": "spain", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "barcelona supercomputing center and universitat politecnica de catalunya spain", "city": null, "Name": "eduard ayguade"}, {"country": "Brazil", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "department of computer science university of brasilia brazil cep", "city": "brasilia", "Name": "george teodoro"}, {"country": "Brazil", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "department of computer science university of brasilia brazil cep", "city": "brasilia", "Name": "alba c m a de melo"}]}, "Article No.: 21": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2856513", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "james larus", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100277326"}, {"name": "sandhya dwarkadas", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100386786"}, {"name": "jose moreira", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81544454856"}, {"name": "andrew lumsdaine", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453640274"}], "title": "Introduction to the Special Issue on PPoPP\u201914", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": 0, "Downloads (6 weeks) ": 0, "Downloads (cumulative)": 0, "Citation Count": 0}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "james larus"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "sandhya dwarkadasuniversity of rochester"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "jose moreiraibm research"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "andrew lumsdaine"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2016"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 8": {"references": ["David A.

We compare two multicore thread-parallel adaptations of a state-of-the-art branch-and-bound algorithm for the maximum clique problem and provide a novel explanation as to why they are successful. We show that load balance is sometimes a problem but that the interaction of parallel search order and the most likely location of solutions within the search space is often the dominating consideration. We use this explanation to propose a new low-overhead, scalable work-splitting mechanism. Our approach uses explicit early diversity to avoid strong commitment to the weakest heuristic advice and late resplitting for balance. More generally, we argue that, for branch-and-bound, parallel algorithm design should not be performed independently of the underlying sequential algorithm.", "authors": [{"name": "ciaran mccreesh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658700793"}, {"name": "patrick prosser", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100170651"}], "title": "The Shape of the Search Tree for the Maximum Clique Problem and the Implications for Parallel Branch and Bound", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": 0, "Downloads (6 weeks) ": 0, "Downloads (cumulative)": 0, "Citation Count": 0}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of glasgow", "affiliation_string": "university of glasgow glasgow scotland", "city": "glasgow", "Name": "ciaran mccreesh"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "university of glasgow", "affiliation_string": "university of glasgow glasgow scotland", "city": "glasgow", "Name": "patrick prosser"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Saurabh Agarwal , Rahul Garg , Nisheeth K.

The resulting load imbalances from this nonuniformity are expected to arise from a variety of sources\u2014manufacturing discrepancies, dynamic power management, runtime component failure, OS jitter, software-mediated resiliency, and TLB/- cache performance variations, for example. It is well understood that existing algorithms with frequent points of bulk synchronization will perform relatively poorly in the presence of these sources of process nonuniformity. Thus, recasting classic bulk synchronous algorithms into more asynchronous, coarse-grained parallelism is a critical area of research for next-generation computing. We propose a class of parallel algorithms for explicit stencil computations that can tolerate these nonuniformities by decoupling per process communication and computation in order for each process to progress asynchronously while maintaining solution correctness. These algorithms are benchmarked with a 1D domain decomposed (\u201cslabbed\u201d) implementation of the 2D heat equation as a model problem, and are tested in the presence of simulated nonuniform process execution rates.

The formation problems we consider are the Gatheringproblem and the Chain-Formationproblem. In the Gatheringproblem, the robots have to gather in one (not predefined) point, while in the Chain-Formationproblem they have to form a connected communication chain of minimal length between two stationary base stations. Each robot may base its decisions where to move only on the current relative positions of neighboring robots (that are within its viewing range); that is, besides having a limited viewing range, the robots are oblivious (they do not use information from the past), have none or only very limited identities, and they do not have a common sense of direction.Variants of these problems (especially for the Gatheringproblem) have been studied extensively in different discrete time models. In contrast, our work focuses on a continuous time model; that is, the robots continuously sense the positions of other robots within their viewing range and continuously adapt their speed and direction according to some simple, local rules. Hereby, we assume that the robots have a maximum movement speed of one. We show that this idealized idea of continuous sensing allows us to solve the mentioned formation problems in linear time O(n) (which, given the maximum speed of one, immediately yields a maximum traveled distance of O(n)). Note that in the more classical discrete time models, the best known strategies need at least \u0398(n2) or even \u0398(n2logn) timesteps to solve these problems. For the Gatheringproblem, our analysis solves a problem left open by Gordon et al. [2004], where the authors could prove that gathering in a continuous model is possible in finite time, but were not able to give runtime bounds.Apart from these linear bounds, we also provide runtime bounds for both formation problems that relate the runtime of our strategies to the runtime of an optimal, global algorithm. Specifically, we show that our strategy for the Gatheringproblem is log OPT-competitive and the strategy for the Chain-Formationproblem is logn-competitive. Here, byc-competitive, we mean that our (local) strategy is asymptotically by at most a factor ofcslower than an optimal, global strategy.", "authors": [{"name": "bastian degener", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81421595026"}, {"name": "barbara kempkes", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453654754"}, {"name": "peter kling", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81481647666"}, {"name": "friedhelm meyer auf der heide", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81361607220"}], "title": "Linear and Competitive Strategies for Continuous Robot Formation Problems", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": 0, "Downloads (6 weeks) ": 0, "Downloads (cumulative)": 0, "Citation Count": 0}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of paderborn heinz nixdorf institute paderborn germany", "city": "paderborn", "Name": "bastian degener"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of paderborn heinz nixdorf institute paderborn germany", "city": "paderborn", "Name": "barbara kempkes"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of paderborn heinz nixdorf institute paderborn germany", "city": "paderborn", "Name": "peter kling"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of paderborn heinz nixdorf institute paderborn germany", "city": "paderborn", "Name": "friedhelm meyer auf der heide"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2716306", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "maurice herlihy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658714849"}], "title": "Guest Editor Introduction", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": 0, "Downloads (6 weeks) ": 0, "Downloads (cumulative)": 0, "Citation Count": 0}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "brown university", "city": null, "Name": "maurice herlihy"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Pedram Azad, Tilo Gockel, and Rudiger Dillmann. 2008.

Here we show how runtime observations of the resource requirements of tasks can be used to adapt resource allocations. Furthermore, we show how the optimum can be traded for a high degree of scalability by clustering applications in a distributed, hierarchical manner. To diminish the negative effects of unreliable cores, this article shows how self-organization can effectively restore the integrity of such a hierarchy when it is corrupted by a failing core.

In our model, we incorporate the importance of the due date of a job rather than the number of servers allocated to it at any given time. Each batch job is characterized by the work volume of total computing units (e.g., CPU hours) along with a bound on maximum degree of parallelism. Users specify, along with these job characteristics, their desired due date and a value for finishing the job by its deadline. Given this specification, the primary goal is to determine theschedulingof cloud computing instances under capacity constraints in order to maximize the social welfare (i.e., sum of values gained by allocated users). Our main result is a new (CC-k&cdot;ss-1)-approximation algorithm for this objective, whereCdenotes cloud capacity,kis the maximal bound on parallelized execution (in practical settings,k<C) andsis the slackness on the job completion time, that is, the minimal ratio between a specified deadline and the earliest finish time of a job. Our algorithm is based on utilizing dual fitting arguments over a strengthened linear program to the problem.Based on the new approximation algorithm, we construct truthful allocation and pricing mechanisms, in which reporting the true value and other properties of the job (deadline, work volume, and the parallelism bound) is a dominant strategy for all users. To that end, we extend known results for single-value settings to provide a general framework for transforming allocation algorithms into truthful mechanisms in domains of single-value and multi-properties. We then show that the basic mechanism can be extended under proper Bayesian assumptions to the objective of maximizing revenues, which is important for public clouds. We empirically evaluate the benefits of our approach through simulations on data-center job traces, and show that the revenues obtained under our mechanism are comparable with anidealfixed-price mechanism, which sets an on-demand price using oracle knowledge of users\u2019 valuations. Finally, we discuss how our model can be extended to accommodate uncertainties in job work volumes, which is a practical challenge in cloud settings.", "authors": [{"name": "navendu jain", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310487383"}, {"name": "ishai menache", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100627066"}, {"name": "joseph seffi naor", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351600927"}, {"name": "jonathan yaniv", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490693749"}], "title": "Near-Optimal Scheduling Mechanisms for Deadline-Sensitive Jobs in Large Computing Clusters", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": 0, "Downloads (6 weeks) ": 0, "Downloads (cumulative)": 0, "Citation Count": 0}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research redmond wa", "city": null, "Name": "navendu jain"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research redmond wa", "city": null, "Name": "ishai menache"}, {"country": "israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cs department technion israel", "city": null, "Name": "joseph seffi naor"}, {"country": "israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cs department technion israel", "city": null, "Name": "jonathan yaniv"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Arizona State University. 2011.

However, the virtual channel (VC) buffers in the NoC consume significant dynamic and leakage power. To improve the energy efficiency of the router design, it is advantageous to use small buffer sizes while still maintaining throughput of the network. This article proposes two new virtual channel allocation (VA) mechanisms, termedfixed VC assignment with dynamic VC allocation(FVADA) andadjustable VC assignment with dynamic VC allocation(AVADA). VCs are designated to output ports and allocated to packets according to such assignment. This can help to reduce the head-of-line blocking. Such VC-output port assignment can also be adjusted dynamically to accommodate traffic changes. Simulation results show that both mechanisms can improve network throughput by 41&percnt; on average. Real traffic evaluation shows a network latency reduction of up to 66&percnt;. In addition, AVADA can outperform the baseline in throughput with only half of the buffer size. Finally, we are able to achieve comparable or better throughput than a previous dynamic VC allocator while reducing its critical path delay by 57&percnt;. Hence, the proposed VA mechanisms are suitable for low-power, high-throughput, and high-frequency NoC designs.", "authors": [{"name": "yi xu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=89558629257"}, {"name": "bo zhao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436593999"}, {"name": "youtao zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100126819"}, {"name": "jun yang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81408596070"}], "title": "Simple Virtual Channel Allocation for High-Throughput and High-Frequency On-Chip Routers", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": 0, "Downloads (6 weeks) ": 0, "Downloads (cumulative)": 0, "Citation Count": 0}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of pittsburgh taipa macau china", "city": "pittsburgh", "Name": "yi xu"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of pittsburgh pittsburgh pa", "city": "pittsburgh", "Name": "bo zhao"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of pittsburgh pittsburgh pa", "city": "pittsburgh", "Name": "youtao zhang"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of pittsburgh pittsburgh pa", "city": "pittsburgh", "Name": "jun yang"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Ameer Ahmed Abbasi , Mohamed Younis, A survey on clustering algorithms for wireless sensor networks, Computer Communications, v.30 n.14-15, p.2826-2841, October, 2007[doi>10.1016/j.comcom.2007.05.024]\n", "S.

We investigate clustering from a game-theoretic approach, and consider the class ofhedonic clustering games. Here, aself-organizedclustering is obtained via decisions made by independent players, corresponding to the elements clustered. Being a hedonic setting, the utility of each player is determined by the identity of the other members of her cluster. This class of games seems to be quite robust, as it fits with rather different, yet commonly used, clustering criteria. Specifically, we investigate hedonic clustering games in two different models:fixed clustering, which subdivides intok-median andk-center, andcorrelation clustering. We provide a thorough analysis of these games, characterizing Nash equilibria, and proving upper and lower bounds on the price of anarchy and price of stability. For fixed clustering we focus on the existence of a Nash equilibrium, as it is a rather nontrivial issue in this setting. We study it both for general metrics and special cases, such as line and tree metrics. In the correlation clustering model, we study both minimization and maximization variants, and provide almost tight bounds on both the price of anarchy and price of stability.", "authors": [{"name": "moran feldman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81551789356"}, {"name": "liane lewin-eytan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100614866"}, {"name": "joseph seffi naor", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351600927"}], "title": "Hedonic Clustering Games", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": 0, "Downloads (6 weeks) ": 0, "Downloads (cumulative)": 0, "Citation Count": 0}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cs department technion haifa israel", "city": "haifa", "Name": "moran feldman"}, {"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "yahoo labs haifa israel", "city": "haifa", "Name": "liane lewin-eytan"}, {"country": "Israel", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "cs department technion haifa israel", "city": "haifa", "Name": "joseph seffi naor"}]}}, "date": {"month": "May", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 19": {"references": ["Susanne Albers. 2011.

Our results generalize and improve upon work by Chan et al. [2010], which considers a single speed-scalable processor. Using significantly different techniques, we can not only extend their model to multiprocessors but also prove an enhanced and tight competitive ratio for our algorithm.In our scheduling problem, jobs arrive over time and are preemptable. They have different workloads, values, and deadlines. The scheduler may decide not to finish a job but instead to suffer a loss equaling the job\u2019s value. However, to process a job\u2019s workload until its deadline the scheduler must invest a certain amount of energy. The cost of a schedule is the sum of lost values and invested energy. In order to finish a job, the scheduler has to determine which processors to use and set their speeds accordingly. A processor\u2019s energy consumption is power P\u03b1(s) integrated over time, where P\u03b1(s)&equals;s\u03b1is the power consumption when running at speeds. Since we consider the online variant of the problem, the scheduler has no knowledge about future jobs. This problem was introduced by Chan et al. [2010] for the case of a single processor. They presented an online algorithm that is \u03b1\u03b1+ 2e\u03b1-competitive.

However, implementing greedy algorithms in a distributed setting is challenging since the greedy choice is inherently sequential, and it is not clear how to take advantage of the extra processing power.Our main result is a powerful sampling technique that aids in parallelization of sequential algorithms. Armed with this primitive, we then adapt a broad class of greedy algorithms to the MapReduce paradigm; this class includes maximum cover and submodular maximization subject top-system constraint problems. Our method yields efficient algorithms that run in a logarithmic number of rounds while obtaining solutions that are arbitrarily close to those produced by the standard sequential greedy algorithm. We begin with algorithms for modular maximization subject to a matroid constraint and then extend this approach to obtain approximation algorithms for submodular maximization subject to knapsack orp-system constraints.", "authors": [{"name": "ravi kumar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81553745856"}, {"name": "benjamin moseley", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435600259"}, {"name": "sergei vassilvitskii", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81322509134"}, {"name": "andrea vattani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435599247"}], "title": "Fast Greedy Algorithms in MapReduce and Streaming", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": 0, "Downloads (6 weeks) ": 0, "Downloads (cumulative)": 0, "Citation Count": 0}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "google ca", "city": null, "Name": "ravi kumar"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "washington university in st louis mo", "city": "st louis", "Name": "benjamin moseley"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "google ca", "city": null, "Name": "sergei vassilvitskii"}, {"country": "Mali", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california at san diego", "city": "san", "Name": "andrea vattani"}]}, "Article No.: 20": {"references": ["Micah Adler , Eran Halperin , Richard M.

A cobra walk is a generalization of the well-studied \u201cstandard\u201d random walk, and is useful in modeling and understanding the Susceptible-Infected- Susceptible (SIS)-type of epidemic processes in networks. It can also be helpful in performing light-weight information dissemination in resource-constrained networks. A cobra walk is parameterized by abranching factork. The process starts from an arbitrary vertex, which is labeledactivefor step 1. In each step of a cobra walk, each active vertex chooseskrandom neighbors to become active for the next step (\u201cbranching\u201d). A vertex is active for stept+ 1 only if it is chosen by an active vertex in stept(\u201ccoalescing\u201d). This results in a stochastic process in the underlying network with properties that are quite different from both the standard random walk (which is equivalent to the cobra walk with branching factor 1) as well as other gossip-based rumor spreading mechanisms.We focus on thecover timeof the cobra walk, which is the number of steps for the walk to reach all the vertices, and derive almost-tight bounds for various graph classes. We show anO(log2n) high probability bound for the cover time of cobra walks on expanders, if either the expansion factor or the branching factor is sufficiently large; we also obtain anO(logn) high probability bound for thepartial cover time, which is the number of steps needed for the walk to reach at least a constant fraction of the vertices. We also show that the cover time of the cobra walk is, with high probability,O(nlogn) on anyn-vertex tree fork\u2265 2,\u00d5(n1/d) on ad-dimensional grid fork\u2265 2, andO(logn) on the complete graph.", "authors": [{"name": "chinmoy dutta", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100634453"}, {"name": "gopal pandurangan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350569331"}, {"name": "rajmohan rajaraman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81493655513"}, {"name": "scott roche", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82459102457"}], "title": "Coalescing-Branching Random Walks on Graphs", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": 0, "Downloads (6 weeks) ": 0, "Downloads (cumulative)": 0, "Citation Count": 0}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "chinmoy dutta"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "gopal panduranganuniversity of houston tx usa"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "rajmohan rajaramannortheastern university boston ma usa"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "scott roche", "city": null, "Name": "scott rochenortheastern university boston ma usa"}]}, "Article No.: 18": {"references": ["R.

We allow a current insider to have complete knowledge about the information system and to have the power to block any &epsiv;-fraction of its servers by a DoS attack, where &epsiv; can be chosen up to a constant. The task of the system is to serve any collection of lookup requests with at most one per nonblocked server in an efficient way despite this attack. Previously, scalable solutions were only known for DoS attacks of past insiders, where a past insider only has complete knowledge about some past time pointt0of the information system. Scheideler et al. [Awerbuch and Scheideler 2007; Baumgart et al. 2009] showed that in this case, it is possible to design an information system so that any information that was inserted or last updated aftert0is safe against a DoS attack. But their constructions would not work at all for a current insider. The key idea behind our IRIS system is to make extensive use of coding. More precisely, we present two alternative distributed coding strategies with an at most logarithmic storage overhead that can handle up to a constant fraction of blocked servers.", "authors": [{"name": "martina eikel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82458857457"}, {"name": "christian scheideler", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100489863"}], "title": "IRIS: A Robust Information System Against Insider DoS Attacks", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": 0, "Downloads (6 weeks) ": 0, "Downloads (cumulative)": 0, "Citation Count": 0}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of paderborn paderborn germany", "city": "paderborn", "Name": "martina eikel"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of paderborn paderborn germany", "city": "paderborn", "Name": "christian scheideler"}]}, "Article No.: 16": {"references": ["Baruch Awerbuch , Andrea Richa , Christian Scheideler, A jamming-resistant MAC protocol for single-hop wireless networks, Proceedings of the twenty-seventh ACM symposium on Principles of distributed computing, August 18-21, 2008, Toronto, Canada[doi>10.1145/1400751.1400759]\n", "Sanjoy K.

While most of the users are honest, some users may be malicious and attempt to obtain more than their fair share of the bandwidth. One possible strategy for attacking the system is to simulate multiple fake identities, each of which is given its own equal share of the bandwidth. Such an attack is often referred to as asybil attack. To counter such behavior, we proposeSybilCast, a protocol for multichannel wireless networks that limits the number of fake identities and, in doing so, ensures that each honest user gets at least a constant fraction of his or her fair share of the bandwidth. As a result, each honest user can complete his or her data download in asymptotically optimal time. A key aspect of this protocol is balancing the rate at which new identities are admitted and the maximum number of fake identities that can coexist while keeping the overhead low. Besides sybil attacks, our protocol can also tolerate spoofing and jamming.", "authors": [{"name": "seth gilbert", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100549132"}, {"name": "chaodong zheng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82458796957"}], "title": "SybilCast: Broadcast on the Open Airwaves", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": 0, "Downloads (6 weeks) ": 0, "Downloads (cumulative)": 0, "Citation Count": 0}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "singapore", "university": "national university of singapore", "affiliation_string": "national university of singapore singapore", "city": "singapore", "Name": "seth gilbert"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": "national university of singapore", "affiliation_string": "national university of singapore singapore", "city": "singapore", "Name": "chaodong zheng"}]}, "Article No.: 14e": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2809923", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "michael dinitz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81333488105"}, {"name": "torsten hoefler", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490653040"}], "title": "Introduction to the Special Issue on SPAA 2013", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": 0, "Downloads (6 weeks) ": 0, "Downloads (cumulative)": 0, "Citation Count": 0}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Belize", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "johns hopkins university", "city": "hopkins", "Name": "michael dinitz"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "eth zurich", "city": null, "Name": "torsten hoefler"}]}, "Article No.: 17": {"references": ["Kunal Agrawal, Charles E.

Each stage processes elements of a data stream, passing each processed data element to the next stage, and then taking on a new element before the subsequent stages have necessarily completed their processing. Pipeline parallelism is used especially in streaming applications that perform video, audio, and digital signal processing. Three out of 13 benchmarks in PARSEC, a popular software benchmark suite designed for shared-memory multiprocessors, can be expressed as pipeline parallelism.Whereas most concurrency platforms that support pipeline parallelism use a \u201cconstruct-and-run\u201d approach, this article investigates \u201con-the-fly\u201d pipeline parallelism, where the structure of the pipeline emerges as the program executes rather than being specifieda priori. On-the-fly pipeline parallelism allows the number of stages to vary from iteration to iteration and dependencies to be data dependent. We propose simple linguistics for specifying on-the-fly pipeline parallelism and describe a provably efficient scheduling algorithm, the Piperalgorithm, which integrates pipeline parallelism into a work-stealing scheduler, allowing pipeline and fork-join parallelism to be arbitrarily nested. The Piperalgorithm automatically throttles the parallelism, precluding \u201crunaway\u201d pipelines. Given a pipeline computation withT1work andT\u221espan (critical-path length), Piperexecutes the computation onPprocessors inTP\u2264T1/P+O(T\u221e+lgP) expected time. Piperalso limits stack space, ensuring that it does not grow unboundedly with running time.We have incorporated on-the-fly pipeline parallelism into a Cilk-based work-stealing runtime system. Our prototype Cilk-P implementation exploits optimizations such as \u201clazy enabling\u201d and \u201cdependency folding.\u201d We have ported the three PARSEC benchmarks that exhibit pipeline parallelism to run on Cilk-P. One of these,x264, cannot readily be executed by systems that support only construct-and-run pipeline parallelism. Benchmark results indicate that Cilk-P has low serial overhead and good scalability. Onx264, for example, Cilk-P exhibits a speedup of 13.87 over its respective serial counterpart when running on 16 processors.", "authors": [{"name": "i-ting angelina lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658726933"}, {"name": "charles e leiserson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331497630"}, {"name": "tao b schardl", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81464675067"}, {"name": "zhunping zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82458659257"}, {"name": "jim sukha", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81346489764"}], "title": "On-the-Fly Pipeline Parallelism", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": 0, "Downloads (6 weeks) ": 0, "Downloads (cumulative)": 0, "Citation Count": 0}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "mit csail", "city": null, "Name": "i-ting angelina lee"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "mit csail cambridge ma", "city": "cambridge", "Name": "charles e leiserson"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "mit csail cambridge ma", "city": "cambridge", "Name": "tao b schardl"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "mit csail cambridge ma", "city": "cambridge", "Name": "zhunping zhang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "intel corporation hudson ma", "city": null, "Name": "jim sukha"}]}}, "date": {"month": "October", "year": "2015"}}}, "Volume1": {"Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 15": {"references": ["David Abrahams , Aleksey Gurtovoy, C++ Template Metaprogramming: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques from Boost and Beyond (C++ in Depth Series), Addison-Wesley Professional, 2004\n", "Guenter Ahlers, Siegfried Grossmann, and Detlef Lohse. 2009.

Such computations are normally carried out on supercomputers, whose ever-growing scale induces a fast decline of the Mean Time To Failure (MTTF). This article proposes a new hybrid approach, based on Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance (ABFT), to help matrix factorizations algorithms survive fail-stop failures. We consider extreme conditions, such as the absence of any reliable node and the possibility of losing both data and checksum from a single failure. We will present a generic solution for protecting the right factor, where the updates are applied, of all above mentioned factorizations. For the left factor, where the panel has been applied, we propose a scalable checkpointing algorithm. This algorithm features high degree of checkpointing parallelism and cooperatively utilizes the checksum storage leftover from the right factor protection. The fault-tolerant algorithms derived from this hybrid solution is applicable to a wide range of dense matrix factorizations, with minor modifications. Theoretical analysis shows that the fault tolerance overhead decreases inversely to the scaling in the number of computing units and the problem size. Experimental results of LU and QR factorization on the Kraken (Cray XT5) supercomputer validate the theoretical evaluation and confirm negligible overhead, with- and without-errors. Applicability to tolerate multiple failures and accuracy after multiple recovery is also considered.", "authors": [{"name": "aurelien bouteiller", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100124827"}, {"name": "thomas herault", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100503359"}, {"name": "george bosilca", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81493649389"}, {"name": "peng du", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474679249"}, {"name": "jack dongarra", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100368092"}], "title": "Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance for Dense Matrix Factorizations, Multiple Failures and Accuracy", "citations": [{"Name": "Aurelien Bouteiller ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "George Bosilca ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jack J.

These codes are simulated on representative topologies such as 6-D Torus and multilevel directly connected network (similar to IBM PERCS in Power 775 and Dragonfly in Cray Aries).

However, most collective algorithms are designed to only use one link at a time. In this work, we present novel multiported algorithms for the scatter, gather, all-gather, and reduce-scatter operations. Our algorithms can be combined to create multiported reduce, all-reduce, and broadcast algorithms. Several of these algorithms involve a new technique where we relax the MPI message-ordering constraints to achieve high performance and restore the correctordering using an additional stage of redundant communication.According to our models, on ann-dimensional torus, our algorithms should allow for nearly a 2n-fold improvement in communication performance compared to known, single-ported torus algorithms. In practice, we have achieved nearly 6x better performance on a 32k-node 3-dimensional torus.", "authors": [{"name": "paul sack", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81320494468"}, {"name": "william gropp", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81547992156"}], "title": "Collective Algorithms for Multiported Torus Networks", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": 0, "Downloads (6 weeks) ": 0, "Downloads (cumulative)": 0, "Citation Count": 0}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of illinois at urbana-champaign", "city": null, "Name": "paul sack"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of illinois at urbana-champaign", "city": null, "Name": "william gropp"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["A.

This article presentslock cohorting, a general new technique for designing NUMA-aware locks that is as simple as it is powerful.Lock cohorting allows one to transform any spin-lock algorithm, with minimal nonintrusive changes,into a scalable NUMA-aware spin-lock. Our new cohorting technique allows us to easily create NUMA-aware versions of the TATAS-Backoff, CLH, MCS, and ticket locks, to name a few. Moreover, it allows us to derive a CLH-based cohort abortable lock, the first NUMA-aware queue lock to support abortability.We empirically compared the performance of cohort locks with prior NUMA-aware and classic NUMA-oblivious locks on a synthetic micro-benchmark, a real world key-value store application memcached, as well as the libc memory allocator. Our results demonstrate that cohort locks perform as well or better than known locks when the load is low and significantly out-perform them as the load increases.", "authors": [{"name": "david dice", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332496370"}, {"name": "virendra j marathe", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100087475"}, {"name": "nir shavit", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100074614"}], "title": "Lock Cohorting: A General Technique for Designing NUMA Locks", "citations": [{"Name": "Kishore Kumar Pusukuri ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rajiv Gupta ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Laxmi N.

In this work, we present sequential and distributed-memory parallel algorithms for tridiagonalizing full symmetric and symmetric band matrices that asymptotically reduce communication compared to previous approaches.The tridiagonalization of a symmetric band matrix is a key kernel in solving the symmetric eigenvalue problem for both full and band matrices. In order to preserve structure, tridiagonalization routines use annihilate-and-chase procedures that previously have suffered from poor data locality and high parallel latency cost. We improve both by reorganizing the computation and obtain asymptotic improvements. We also propose new algorithms for reducing a full symmetric matrix to band form in a communication-efficient manner.

We show that bottom-up traversals of the multiway Cartesian tree on the interleaved suffix array and longest common prefix array of a string can be used to answer certain string queries. By adding downward pointers in the tree (e.g. using a hash table), we can also generate suffix trees from suffix arrays on arbitrary alphabets in the same bounds. In conjunction with parallel suffix array algorithms, such as the skew algorithm, this gives a rather simple linear work parallel,O(n\u03b5) time (0<\u03b5<1), algorithm for generating suffix trees over an integer alphabet\u03a3{1, ...,n}, wherenis the length of the input string. It also gives a linear work parallel algorithm requiringO(log2n) time with high probability for constant-sized alphabets. More generally, given a sorted sequence of strings and the longest common prefix lengths between adjacent elements, the algorithm will generate a patricia tree (compacted trie) over the strings. Of independent interest, we describe a work-efficient parallel algorithm for solving the all nearest smaller values problem using Cartesian trees, which is much simpler than the work-efficient parallel algorithm described in previous work.We also present experimental results comparing the performance of the algorithm to existing sequential implementations and a second parallel algorithm that we implement. We present comparisons for the Cartesian tree algorithm on its own and for constructing a suffix tree. The results show that on a variety of strings our algorithm is competitive with the sequential version on a single processor and achieves good speedup on multiple processors. We present experiments for three applications that require only the Cartesian tree, and also for searching using the suffix tree.", "authors": [{"name": "julian shun", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81498652860"}, {"name": "guy e blelloch", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100282539"}], "title": "A simple parallel cartesian tree algorithm and its application to parallel suffix tree construction", "citations": [{"Name": "Osama G.

However these loops often contain data-dependent control-flow and array-access patterns. Traditional optimizations that rely on purely static analysis fail to generate parallel code in such cases.This article proposes an approach for automatic parallelization for distributed memory environments, using both static and runtime analysis. We formalize the computations that are targeted by this approach and develop algorithms to detect such computations. We also describe algorithms to generate a parallel inspector that performs a runtime analysis of control-flow and array-access patterns, and a parallel executor to take advantage of this information.

It deals with streaming data from multiple sources, going to multiple destinations, often requiring repeated application of one or more of several standard algorithmic kernels. These kernels, related to encryption, compression, XML Parsing and regular expression searching on the data, demand a high data processing rate and power efficiency. This suggests the use of hardware acceleration for key functions. However, robust general purpose processing support is necessary to orchestrate the flow of data between accelerators, as well as perform tasks that are not suited to acceleration. Further, these accelerators must be tightly integrated with the general purpose computation in order to keep invocation overhead and latency low. The accelerators must be easy for software to use, and the system must be flexible enough to support evolving networking standards.In this article, we describe and evaluate the architecture of IBM\u2019s PowerEN processor, with a focus on PowerEN\u2019s architectural enhancements and its on-chip hardware accelerators.PowerEN unites the throughput of application-specific accelerators with the programmability of general purpose cores on a single coherent memory architecture. Hardware acceleration improves throughput by orders of magnitude in some cases compared to equivalent computation on the general purpose cores. By offloading work to the accelerators, general purpose cores are freed to simultaneously work on computation less suited to acceleration.", "authors": [{"name": "timothy heil", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=89558620357"}, {"name": "anil krishna", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436595638"}, {"name": "nicholas lindberg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=89558867957"}, {"name": "farnaz toussi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548023490"}, {"name": "steven vanderwiel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548023491"}], "title": "Architecture and Performance of the Hardware Accelerators in IBM\u2019s PowerEN Processor", "citations": [{"Name": "Seyed A.

However, memory access patterns are critical performance limiting factors for today's multicore chips where performance is highly memory bound. Therefore diagnoses and selection of optimizations based only on measurements of the execution behavior of code segments are incomplete because they do not incorporate knowledge of memory access patterns and behaviors. This article presents a low-overhead tool (MACPO) that captures memory traces and computes metrics for the memory access behavior of source-level (C, C++, Fortran) data structures. MACPO explicitly targets the measurement and metrics important to performance optimization for multicore chips. The article also presents a complete process for integrating measurement and analyses of code execution with measurements and analyses of memory access patterns and behaviors for performance optimization, specifically targeting multicore chips and multichip nodes of clusters. MACPO uses more realistic cache models for computation of latency metrics than those used by previous tools. Evaluation of the effectiveness of adding memory access behavior characteristics of data structures to performance optimization was done on subsets of the ASCI, NAS and Rodinia parallel benchmarks and two versions of one application program from a domain not represented in these benchmarks. Adding characteristics of the behavior of data structures enabled easier diagnoses of bottlenecks and more accurate selection of appropriate optimizations than with only code centric behavior measurements. The performance gains ranged from a few percent to 38 percent.", "authors": [{"name": "ashay rane", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490692164"}, {"name": "james browne", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339491511"}], "title": "Enhancing Performance Optimization of Multicore/Multichip Nodes with Data Structure Metrics", "citations": [{"Name": "Madhu Hari ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shirley Moore", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": 0, "Downloads (6 weeks) ": 0, "Downloads (cumulative)": 0, "Citation Count": 0}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of texas at austin", "city": null, "Name": "ashay rane"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of texas at austin", "city": null, "Name": "james browne"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["NR Adiga , G Almasi , GS Almasi , Y Aridor , R Barik , D Beece , R Bellofatto , G Bhanot , R Bickford , M Blumrich , AA Bright , J Brunheroto , C Ca\u015fcaval , J Casta\u00f1os , W Chan , L Ceze , P Coteus , S Chatterjee , D Chen , G Chiu , TM Cipolla , P Crumley , KM Desai , A Deutsch , T Domany , MB Dombrowa , W Donath , M Eleftheriou , C Erway , J Esch , B Fitch , J Gagliano , A Gara , R Garg , R Germain , ME Giampapa , B Gopalsamy , J Gunnels , M Gupta , F Gustavson , S Hall , RA Haring , D Heidel , P Heidelberger , LM Herger , D Hoenicke , RD Jackson , T Jamal-Eddine , GV Kopcsay , E Krevat , MP Kurhekar , AP Lanzetta , D Lieber , LK Liu , M Lu , M Mendell , A Misra , Y Moatti , L Mok , JE Moreira , BJ Nathanson , M Newton , M Ohmacht , A Oliner , V Pandit , RB Pudota , R Rand , R Regan , B Rubin , A Ruehli , S Rus , RK Sahoo , A Sanomiya , E Schenfeld , M Sharma , E Shmueli , S Singh , P Song , V Srinivasan , BD Steinmacher-Burow , K Strauss , C Surovic , R Swetz , T Takken , RB Tremaine , M Tsao , AR Umamaheshwaran , P Verma , P Vranas , TJC Ward , M Wazlowski , W Barrett , C Engel , B Drehmel , B Hilgart , D Hill , F Kasemkhani , D Krolak , CT Li , T Liebsch , J Marcella , A Muff , A Okomo , M Rouse , A Schram , M Tubbs , G Ulsh , C Wait , J Wittrup , M Bae , K Dockser , L Kissel , MK Seager , JS Vetter , K Yates, An overview of the BlueGene/L Supercomputer, Proceedings of the 2002 ACM/IEEE conference on Supercomputing, p.1-22, November 16, 2002, Baltimore, Maryland\n", "Gene M.

Some prefetch engines allow users to change some of their parameters. But, the prefetcher is usually enabled in a default configuration during system bring-up, and dynamic reconfiguration of the prefetch engine is not an autonomic feature of current machines. Conceptually, however, it is easy to infer that commonly used prefetch algorithms---when applied in a fixed mode---will not help performance in many cases. In fact, they may actually degrade performance due to useless bus bandwidth consumption and cache pollution, which in turn, will also waste power. We present an adaptive prefetch scheme that dynamically modifies the prefetch settings in order to adapt to workloads' requirements. We use a commercial processor, namely the IBM POWER7 as a vehicle for our study. First we characterize---in terms of performance and power consumption---the prefetcher in that processor using microbenchmarks and SPEC CPU2006. We then present our adaptive prefetch mechanism showing performance improvements with respect to the default prefetch setting up to 2.7X and 1.3X for single-threaded and multiprogrammed workloads, respectively. Adaptive prefetching is also able to reduce power consumption in some cases. Finally, we also evaluate our mechanism with SPECjbb2005, improving both performance and power consumption.", "authors": [{"name": "victor jimenez", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81470642295"}, {"name": "francisco j cazorla", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100061338"}, {"name": "roberto gioiosa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309511362"}, {"name": "alper buyuktosunoglu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83458827257"}, {"name": "pradip bose", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81556030956"}, {"name": "francis p oconnell", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100394009"}, {"name": "bruce g mealey", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351608284"}], "title": "Adaptive Prefetching on POWER7: Improving Performance and Power Consumption", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": 0, "Downloads (6 weeks) ": 0, "Downloads (cumulative)": 0, "Citation Count": 0}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "barcelona supercomputing center and universitat politecnica de catalunya", "city": null, "Name": "victor jimenez"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "barcelona supercomputing center and spanish national research council", "city": null, "Name": "francisco j cazorla"}, {"country": "Iceland", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "pacific northwest national laboratory", "city": "northwest", "Name": "roberto gioiosa"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm t j watson research center", "city": null, "Name": "alper buyuktosunoglu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm t j watson research center", "city": null, "Name": "pradip bose"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm systems and technology group", "city": null, "Name": "francis p oconnell"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm systems and technology group", "city": null, "Name": "bruce g mealey"}]}}, "date": {"month": "September", "year": "2014"}}}}}}
