As data and access to them are not under the control of the data owner, there is a clear need to provide proper confidentiality protection. Such requirements concern the confidentiality not only of the stored data (content) but also of the specific accesses (or patterns of them) that users make on such data.In this article, we address these issues and propose an approach for guaranteeing content, access, and pattern confidentiality in a data outsourcing scenario. The proposed solution is based on the definition of ashuffle indexstructure, which adapts traditionalB+-trees and, by applying a combination of techniques (covers, caches, and shuffling), ensures confidentiality of the data and of queries over them, protecting each single access as well as sequences thereof. The proposed solution also supports update operations over the data, while making reads and writes not recognizable as such by the server. We show that the shuffle index exhibits a limited performance cost, thus resulting effectively usable in practice.", "authors": [{"name": "sabrina de capitani di vimercati", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474652286"}, {"name": "sara foresti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339499404"}, {"name": "stefano paraboschi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474663904"}, {"name": "gerardo pelosi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331501606"}, {"name": "pierangela samarati", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100191823"}], "title": "Shuffle Index: Efficient and Private Access to Outsourced Data", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "115\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "15\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "115\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universita degli studi di milano crema cr italy", "city": null, "Name": "sabrina de capitani di vimercati"}, {"country": "italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universita degli studi di milano crema cr italy", "city": null, "Name": "sara foresti"}, {"country": "Italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universita degli studi di bergamo dalmine bg italy", "city": "bergamo", "Name": "stefano paraboschi"}, {"country": "italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "politecnico di milano milano mi italy", "city": null, "Name": "gerardo pelosi"}, {"country": "italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "universita degli studi di milano crema cr italy", "city": null, "Name": "pierangela samarati"}]}, "Article No.: 18": {"references": ["Alok Aggarwal , Jeffrey,S.

WODS are promising building blocks for storage systems because they support both microwrites and large scans efficiently. Previous WODS-based file systems have shown promise but have been hampered in several ways, which BetrFS mitigates or eliminates altogether. For example, previous WODS-based file systems were implemented in user space using FUSE, which superimposes many reads on a write-intensive workload, reducing the effectiveness of the WODS. This article also contributes several techniques for exploiting write-optimization within existing kernel infrastructure. BetrFS dramatically improves performance of certain types of large scans, such as recursive directory traversals, as well as performance of arbitrary microdata operations, such as file creates, metadata updates, and small writes to files. BetrFS can make small, random updates within a large file 2 orders of magnitude faster than other local file systems. BetrFS is an ongoing prototype effort and requires additional data-structure tuning to match current general-purpose file systems on some operations, including deletes, directory renames, and large sequential writes. Nonetheless, many applications realize significant performance improvements on BetrFS. For instance, an in-place rsync of the Linux kernel source sees roughly 1.6--22 \u00d7 speedup over commodity file systems.", "authors": [{"name": "william jannen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81758661957"}, {"name": "jun yuan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658695090"}, {"name": "yang zhan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658693848"}, {"name": "amogh akshintala", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658694069"}, {"name": "john esmet", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81504688567"}, {"name": "yizheng jiao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658692601"}, {"name": "ankur mittal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658692500"}, {"name": "prashant pandey", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658693663"}, {"name": "phaneendra reddy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658694230"}, {"name": "leif walsh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81501660573"}, {"name": "michael a bender", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100458566"}, {"name": "martin farach-colton", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100286426"}, {"name": "rob johnson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81444594030"}, {"name": "bradley c kuszmaul", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100365470"}, {"name": "donald e porter", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100437540"}], "title": "BetrFS: Write-Optimization in a Kernel File System", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "154\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "23\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "154\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "stony brook university stony brook ny", "city": null, "Name": "william jannen"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "stony brook university stony brook ny", "city": null, "Name": "jun yuan"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "stony brook university stony brook ny", "city": null, "Name": "yang zhan"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "stony brook university stony brook ny", "city": null, "Name": "amogh akshintala"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "john esmet"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "jun yuanstony brook university stony brook ny", "city": null, "Name": "yizheng jiaostony brook university stony brook ny"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "stony brook university stony brook ny", "city": null, "Name": "michael a bender"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "rutgers university piscataway nj", "city": null, "Name": "martin farach-colton"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "stony brook university stony brook ny", "city": null, "Name": "rob johnson"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "massachusetts institute of technology cambridge ma", "city": "cambridge", "Name": "bradley c kuszmaul"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "stony brook university stony brook ny", "city": null, "Name": "donald e porter"}]}, "Article No.: 16": {"references": ["Ahmed Amer , Darrell D.

These observations not only confirm inferences from measurements, but resolve ambiguities that arise from the use of latency measurements alone.

Even though such systems are designed to withstand the failure of individual disks, failure of multiple disks poses a unique set of challenges. We empirically investigate disk failure data from a large number of production systems, specifically focusing on the impact of disk failures on RAID storage systems. Our data covers about one million SATA disks from six disk models for periods up to 5 years. We show how observed disk failures weaken the protection provided by RAID. The count ofreallocated sectorscorrelates strongly with impending failures.With these findings we designed RAIDShield, which consists of two components. First, we have built and evaluated an active defense mechanism that monitors the health of each disk and replaces those that are predicted to fail imminently. This proactive protection has been incorporated into our product and is observed to eliminate 88&percnt; of triple disk errors, which are 80&percnt; of all RAID failures. Second, we have designed and simulated a method of using the joint failure probability to quantify and predict how likely a RAID group is to face multiple simultaneous disk failures, which can identify disks that collectively represent a risk of failure even when no individual disk is flagged in isolation. We find in simulation that RAID-level analysis can effectively identify most vulnerable RAID-6 systems, improving the coverage to 98&percnt; of triple errors.We conclude with discussions of operational considerations in deploying RAIDShieldmore broadly and new directions in the analysis of disk errors. One interesting approach is to combine multiple metrics, allowing the values of different indicators to be used for predictions. Using newer field data that reports an additional metric,medium errors, we find that the relative efficacy of reallocated sectors and medium errors varies across disk models, offering an additional way to predict failures.", "authors": [{"name": "ao ma", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658695047"}, {"name": "rachel traylor", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658769277"}, {"name": "fred douglis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100470359"}, {"name": "mark chamness", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502811646"}, {"name": "guanlin lu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87358663657"}, {"name": "darren sawyer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81470648453"}, {"name": "surendar chandra", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100394236"}, {"name": "windsor hsu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658692921"}], "title": "RAIDShield: Characterizing, Monitoring, and Proactively Protecting Against Disk Failures", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "73\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "17\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "73\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "ao ma"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "rachel traylor"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "fred douglis"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "mark chamness"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "guanlin lu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "darren sawyer"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "surendar chandra"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "windsor hsu"}]}, "Article No.: 15": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2825000", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "jiri schindler", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100547632"}, {"name": "erez zadok", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81501651645"}], "title": "Introduction to the Special Issue on USENIX FAST 2015", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "90\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "16\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "90\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "jiri schindler"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "erez zadok"}]}}, "date": {"month": "November", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Ameen Akel , Adrian M.

To address this objective, we developed (i) a native management layer for NVRAM to eliminate redundancy between in-core and on-disk copies of the metadata, (ii) an expandable object format, (iii) a burst trie-based global name space with local name space caching, (iv) static address binding, and (v)minimallogging forundo-onlycrash recovery. We implemented HEAPO at commodity OS (Linux 2.6.32) and measured the performance. By eliminating metadata redundancy, HEAPO improved the speed of creating, attaching, and expanding an object by 1.3\u00d7, 4.5\u00d7, and 3.8\u00d7, respectively, compared to memory-mapped file-based persistent object store. Burst trie-based name space organization of HEAPO yielded 7.6\u00d7 better lookup performance compared to hashed B-tree-based name space of EXT4. We modified memcachedb to use HEAPO in maintaining its search structure. For hash table update, HEAPO-based memcachedb yielded 3.4\u00d7 performance improvement against original memcachedb implementation which uses mmap() over ramdisk approach to maintain the key-value store in memory.", "authors": [{"name": "taeho hwang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658668154"}, {"name": "jaemin jung", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81458642596"}, {"name": "youjip won", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100455351"}], "title": "HEAPO: Heap-Based Persistent Object Store", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "222\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "31\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "360\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "korea south", "university": "hanyang university", "affiliation_string": "hanyang university", "city": "soul", "Name": "taeho hwang"}, {"country": "korea south", "university": "hanyang university", "affiliation_string": "hanyang university", "city": "soul", "Name": "jaemin jung"}, {"country": "korea south", "university": "hanyang university", "affiliation_string": "hanyang university", "city": "soul", "Name": "youjip won"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["A.

To overcome these limitations, we proposed a novel space management and address mapping scheme for flash referred to as Z-MAP, which manages flash space at granularity of Zone. Each Zone consists of multiple numbers of flash blocks. Leveraging workload classification, Z-MAP explores Page-mapping Zone (Page Zone) to store random data and handle a large number of partial updates, and Block-mapping Zone (Block Zone) to store sequential data and lower the overall mapping table. Zones are dynamically allocated and a mapping scheme for a Zone is determined only when it is allocated. Z-MAP uses a small part of Flash memory or phase change memory as a streaming Buffer Zone to log data sequentially and migrate data into Page Zone or Block Zone based on workload classification. A two-level address mapping is designed to reduce the overall mapping table and address translation latency. Z-MAP classifies data before it is permanently stored into Flash memory so that different workloads can be isolated and garbage collection overhead can be minimized.Z-MAP has been extensively evaluated by trace-driven simulation and a prototype implementation on OpenSSD. Our benchmark results conclusively demonstrate that Z-MAP can achieve up to 76&percnt; performance improvement, 81&percnt; mapping table reduction, and 88&percnt; garbage collection overhead reduction compared to existing Flash Translation Layer (FTL) schemes.", "authors": [{"name": "qingsong wei", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474683541"}, {"name": "cheng chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658689697"}, {"name": "mingdi xue", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658688792"}, {"name": "jun yang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658689132"}], "title": "Z-MAP: A Zone-Based Flash Translation Layer with Workload Classification for Solid-State Drive", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "162\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "31\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "210\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "singapore", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "data storage institute a-star singapore", "city": null, "Name": "qingsong wei"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "data storage institute a-star singapore", "city": null, "Name": "cheng chen"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "data storage institute a-star singapore", "city": null, "Name": "mingdi xue"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "data storage institute a-star singapore", "city": null, "Name": "jun yang"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Bill Andrews. 2013.

However, inline deduplication degrades restore performance of the latest backup due to fragmentation, and complicates deletion of expired backups due to the sharing of data chunks. While out-of-line deduplication addresses the problems by forward-pointing existing duplicate chunks to those of the latest backup, it introduces additional I/Os of writing and removing duplicate chunks.We design and implementRevDedup, an efficient hybrid inline and out-of-line deduplication system for backup storage. It applies coarse-grained inline deduplication to remove duplicates of the latest backup, and then fine-grained out-of-line reverse deduplication to remove duplicates from older backups. Our reverse deduplication design limits the I/O overhead and prepares for efficient deletion of expired backups. Through extensive testbed experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that RevDedup can bring high performance to the backup, restore, and deletion operations, while maintaining high storage efficiency comparable to conventional inline deduplication.", "authors": [{"name": "yan-kit li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658663068"}, {"name": "min xu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658671749"}, {"name": "chun-ho ng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82659120857"}, {"name": "patrick p c lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323492922"}], "title": "Efficient Hybrid Inline and Out-of-Line Deduplication for Backup Storage", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "118\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "14\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "206\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "hong kong", "university": "university of hong kong", "affiliation_string": "the chinese university of hong kong", "city": "xianggangdao", "Name": "yan-kit li"}, {"country": "hong kong", "university": "university of hong kong", "affiliation_string": "the chinese university of hong kong", "city": "xianggangdao", "Name": "min xu"}, {"country": "hong kong", "university": "university of hong kong", "affiliation_string": "the chinese university of hong kong", "city": "xianggangdao", "Name": "chun-ho ng"}, {"country": "hong kong", "university": "university of hong kong", "affiliation_string": "the chinese university of hong kong", "city": "xianggangdao", "Name": "patrick p c lee"}]}}, "date": {"month": "February", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Nitin Agrawal , William J.

Unlike existing informed-based context-aware systems, Frog is a unifying informed-based framework that abstracts context-specific solutions as views, allowing applications to make view selections according to application behaviors. The framework can not only eliminate overheads induced by traditional context analysis, but also simplify the interactions between the context-based file systems and applications. Rather than propagating data through solution-specific interfaces, views in Frog can be selected by inserting their names in file path strings. With Frog in place, programmers can migrate an application from one solution to another by switching among views rather than changing programming interfaces. Since the data consistency issues are automatically enforced by the framework, file-system developers can focus their attention on context-specific solutions. We implement two prototypes to demonstrate the strengths and overheads of our design. Inspired by an observation that there are more than 50&percnt; of small files (<4KB) in a file system, we create a Bi-context Archiving Virtual File System (BAVFS) that utilizes conservative and aggressive prefetching for the contexts of random and sequential reads. To improve the performance of random read-and-write operations, the Bi-context Hybrid Virtual File System (BHVFS) combines theupdate-in-placeandupdate-out-of-placesolutions for read-intensive and write-intensive contexts. Our experimental results show that the benefits of Frog-based CBFSs outweigh the overheads introduced by integrating multiple context-specific solutions.", "authors": [{"name": "ji zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84459310457"}, {"name": "xunfei jiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82458795757"}, {"name": "xiao qin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81423594868"}, {"name": "wei-shinn ku", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435603475"}, {"name": "mohammed i alghamdi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100231744"}], "title": "Frog: A Framework for Context-Based File Systems", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "191\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "17\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "191\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "auburn university al", "city": null, "Name": "ji zhang"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "earlham college richmond in", "city": "richmond", "Name": "xunfei jiang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "auburn university al", "city": null, "Name": "xiao qin"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "auburn university al", "city": null, "Name": "wei-shinn ku"}, {"country": "saudi arabia", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "al-baha university al-baha city kingdom of saudi arabia", "city": null, "Name": "mohammed i alghamdi"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Charu C.

ImmortalGraph is a storage and execution engine designed and optimized specifically for temporal graphs. Locality is at the center of ImmortalGraph\u2019s design: temporal graphs are carefully laid out in both persistent storage and memory, taking into account data locality in both time and graph-structure dimensions. ImmortalGraph introduces the notion oflocality-aware batch schedulingin computation, so that common \u201cbulk\u201d operations on temporal graphs are scheduled to maximize the benefit of in-memory data locality. The design of ImmortalGraph explores an interesting interplay among locality, parallelism, and incremental computation in supporting common mining tasks on temporal graphs. The result is a high-performance temporal-graph system that is up to 5 times more efficient than existing database solutions for graph queries. The locality optimizations in ImmortalGraph offer up to an order of magnitude speedup for temporal iterative graph mining compared to a straightforward application of existing graph engines on a series of snapshots.", "authors": [{"name": "youshan miao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81501652714"}, {"name": "wentao han", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81500653491"}, {"name": "kaiwei li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81552581656"}, {"name": "ming wu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81340494187"}, {"name": "fan yang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81501661125"}, {"name": "lidong zhou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100264797"}, {"name": "vijayan prabhakaran", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100181112"}, {"name": "enhong chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323488612"}, {"name": "wenguang chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100108264"}], "title": "ImmortalGraph: A System for Storage and Analysis of Temporal Graphs", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "253\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "29\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "253\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "university of science and technology of china", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "youshan miao"}, {"country": "china", "university": "tsinghua university", "affiliation_string": "tsinghua university", "city": "peking", "Name": "wentao han"}, {"country": "china", "university": "tsinghua university", "affiliation_string": "tsinghua university", "city": "peking", "Name": "kaiwei li"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research asia", "city": null, "Name": "ming wu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research asia", "city": null, "Name": "fan yang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research asia", "city": null, "Name": "lidong zhou"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research silicon valley", "city": null, "Name": "vijayan prabhakaran"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "university of science and technology of china", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "enhong chen"}, {"country": "china", "university": "tsinghua university", "affiliation_string": "tsinghua university", "city": "peking", "Name": "wenguang chen"}]}, "Article No.: 12": {"references": ["Nitin Agrawal , William J.

Metadata is stored as blocks on the hard disk drive. Partial metadata update results in whole-block read or write, which significantly amplifies disk I/O. Furthermore, a huge performance gap between the CPU and disk aggravates this problem. In this article, a file system metadata accelerator (referred to as FSMAC) is proposed to optimize metadata access by efficiently exploiting the persistency and byte-addressability of Nonvolatile Memory (NVM). The FSMAC decouples data and metadata access path, putting data on disk and metadata in byte-addressable NVM at runtime. Thus, data is accessed in a block from I/O the bus and metadata is accessed in a byte-addressable manner from the memory bus. Metadata access is significantly accelerated and metadata I/O is eliminated because metadata in NVM is no longer flushed back to the disk periodically. A lightweight consistency mechanism combining fine-grained versioning and transaction is introduced in the FSMAC.

Evaluation results show that the FSMAC accelerates the file system up to 49.2 times for synchronized I/O and 7.22 times for asynchronized I/O.

Designs optimized for one dimension or workload often suffer in another. Therefore, it is important to study the trade-offs to enable adaptation to workloads and dimensions. As Flash SSD has emerged, hybrid drives have been studied more closely. However, hybrids are mainly designed for high throughput, efficient energy consumption, or improving endurance\u2014leaving quantitative study on the trade-offs unexplored. Past endurance studies also lack a concrete model to help study the trade-offs. Last, previous designs are often based on inflexible policies that cannot adapt easily to changing conditions.We designed and developedGreenDM, a versatile hybrid drive that combines Flash-based SSDs with traditional HDDs. The SSD can be used as cache or as primary storage for hot data. We present our endurance model together with GreenDM to study these trade-offs. GreenDM presents a block interface and requires no modifications to existing software. GreenDM offers tunable parameters to enable the system to adapt to many workloads. We have designed, developed, and carefully evaluated GreenDM with a variety of workloads using commodity SSD and HDD drives.

We developed an accurate energy consumption model for SSDs that computes aggregate, as well as component-specific, energy consumption of SSDs in sub-msec time scale. In our study, we used five different FTLs (page mapping, DFTL, block mapping, and two different hybrid mappings) and four different channel configurations (two, four, eight, and 16 channels) under seven different workloads (from large-scale enterprise systems to small-scale desktop applications) in a combinatorial manner. For each combination of the aforementioned parameters, we examined the energy consumption for individual hardware components of an SSD (microcontroller, DRAM, NAND flash, and host interface). The following are some of our findings. First, DFTL is the most energy-efficient address-mapping scheme among the five FTLs we tested due to its good write amplification and small DRAM footprint. Second, a significant fraction of energy is being consumed by idle flash chips waiting for the completion of NAND operations in the other channels. FTL should be designed to fully exploit the internal parallelism so that energy consumption by idle chips is minimized. Third, as a means to increase the internal parallelism, increasing way parallelism (the number of flash chips in a channel) is more effective than increasing channel parallelism in terms of peak energy consumption, performance, and hardware complexity. Fourth, in designing high-performance and energy-efficient SSDs, channel switching delay, way switching delay, and page write latency need to be incorporated in an integrated manner to determine the optimal configuration of internal parallelism.", "authors": [{"name": "seokhei cho", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81486643851"}, {"name": "changhyun park", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87258622057"}, {"name": "youjip won", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100455351"}, {"name": "sooyong kang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100494380"}, {"name": "jaehyuk cha", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81540174556"}, {"name": "sungroh yoon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82258983957"}, {"name": "jongmoo choi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81381601077"}], "title": "Design Tradeoffs of SSDs: From Energy Consumption\u2019s Perspective", "citations": [{"Name": "Yongseok Oh ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Eunjae Lee ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Choulseung Hyun ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jongmoo Choi ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Donghee Lee ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sam H.

However, in most cases, the authors did not analyze the reliability of their solutions. According to research conducted by Google and the IDEMA standard, frequently setting the disk status to standby mode will increase the disk\u2019s Annual Failure Rate and reduce its lifespan. To resolve the issue, we propose an evaluation function called E3SaRC (Economic Evaluation of Energy Saving with Reliability Constraint), which considers the cost of hardware failure when applying energy-saving schemes. We also present an adaptive write cache mechanism called CacheRAID. The mechanism tries to mitigate the random access problems that implicitly exist in RAID techniques and thereby reduce the energy consumption of RAID disks. CacheRAID also addresses the issue of system reliability by applying a control mechanism to the spin-down algorithm. Our experimental results show that the CacheRAID storage system can reduce the power consumption of the conventional software RAID 5 system by 65&percnt; to 80&percnt;. Moreover, according to the E3SaRC measurement, the overall saved cost of CacheRAID is the largest among the systems that we compared.", "authors": [{"name": "tseng-yi chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81501643638"}, {"name": "hsin-wen wei", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81551979456"}, {"name": "tsung-tai yeh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474641005"}, {"name": "tsan-sheng hsu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81381604556"}, {"name": "wei-kuan shih", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451597733"}], "title": "An Energy-Efficient and Reliable Storage Mechanism for Data-Intensive Academic Archive Systems", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "197\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "13\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "210\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national tsing hua university hsinchu taiwan", "city": null, "Name": "tseng-yi chen"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "tamkang university", "affiliation_string": "tamkang university", "city": "taibei", "Name": "hsin-wen wei"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "purdue university", "city": null, "Name": "tsung-tai yeh"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "academia sinica", "city": null, "Name": "tsan-sheng hsu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national tsing hua university hsinchu taiwan", "city": null, "Name": "wei-kuan shih"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Simona Boboila , Peter Desnoyers, Performance models of flash-based solid-state drives for real workloads, Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE 27th Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies, p.1-6, May 23-27, 2011[doi>10.1109/MSST.2011.5937227]\n", "Tyler Cossentine and Ramon Lawrence. 2013.

Recently, the implementation of database systems using an NAND flash-based storage system has become an important research topic. In particular, the external sorting is an important operation in database systems. With the very distinctive characteristics of flash memory, the typical external sorting system that adopts a clustered sorting process can result in performance degradation and reduce the reliability of flash memory. In this article, we will propose an unclustered sorting method that considers the unique characteristics of flash memory, and we then propose a decision rule to exploit the advantages of both clustered and unclustered sorting. The decision rule can separate records according to their record length, sort them appropriately by the clustered and unclustered sorting, and merge the sorted results. The experimental results show that the proposed method can improve performance in an NAND flash-based storage system (i.e., solid-state drive).", "authors": [{"name": "chin-hsien wu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100663203"}, {"name": "kuo-yi huang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658692855"}], "title": "Data Sorting in Flash Memory", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "192\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "20\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "203\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "taiwan", "university": "national taiwan university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "national taiwan university of science and technology keelung rd taipei taiwan", "city": "taibei", "Name": "chin-hsien wu"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "national taiwan university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "national taiwan university of science and technology keelung rd taipei taiwan", "city": "taibei", "Name": "kuo-yi huang"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Anant Agarwal , John Hennessy , Mark Horowitz, Cache performance of operating system and multiprogramming workloads, ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS), v.6 n.4, p.393-431, Nov. 1988[doi>10.1145/48012.48037]\n", "M.

Consequently, to effectively exploit the underlying hardware resources, for example, CPU cycles, storage bandwidth and the like, whenever an IO request is issued to such device, the requesting thread is switched out in favor of another thread that may be ready to execute. Recent advances in nonvolatile storage technologies and multicore CPUs make both of these assumptions increasingly questionable, and an unconditional context switch is no longer desirable. In this article, we propose a novel mechanism called SmartCon, which intelligently decides whether to service a given IO request in interrupt-driven manner or busy-wait--based manner based on not only the device characteristics but also dynamic parameters such as IO latency, CPU utilization, and IO size. We develop an analytic performance model to project the performance of SmartCon for forthcoming devices. We implement SmartCon mechanism on Linux 2.6 and perform detailed evaluation using three different IO devices: Ramdisk, low-end SSD, and high-end SSD. We find that SmartCon yields up to a 39&percnt; performance gain over the mainstream block device approach for Ramdisk, and up to a 45&percnt; gain for PCIe-based SSD and SATA-based SSDs. We examine the detailed behavior of TLB, L1, L2 cache and show that SmartCon achieves significant improvement in all cache misbehaviors.", "authors": [{"name": "jongmin gim", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375617592"}, {"name": "taeho hwang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658668154"}, {"name": "youjip won", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100455351"}, {"name": "krishna kant", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658694628"}], "title": "SmartCon: SmartCon: Smart Context Switching for Fast Storage Devices", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "229\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "18\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "248\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "texas am university", "city": null, "Name": "jongmin gim"}, {"country": "korea south", "university": "hanyang university", "affiliation_string": "hanyang university", "city": "soul", "Name": "taeho hwang"}, {"country": "korea south", "university": "hanyang university", "affiliation_string": "hanyang university", "city": "soul", "Name": "youjip won"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "temple university", "city": null, "Name": "krishna kant"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["R.

Flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs) are widely used as a new cache tier on top of hard disk drives (HDDs) to speed up data-intensive applications. However, the endurance problem of flash memory remains a concern and is getting worse with the adoption of MLC and TLC flash. In this article, we propose a novel cache management algorithm for flash-based disk cache named Lazy Adaptive Replacement Cache (LARC). LARC adopts the idea of selective caching to filter out seldom accessed blocks and prevent them from entering cache. This avoids cache pollution and preserves popular blocks in cache for a longer period of time, leading to a higher hit rate. Meanwhile, by avoiding unnecessary cache replacements, LARC reduces the volume of data written to the SSD and yields an SSD-friendly access pattern. In this way, LARC improves the performance and endurance of the SSD at the same time. LARC is self-tuning and incurs little overhead. It has been extensively evaluated by both trace-driven simulations and synthetic benchmarks on a prototype implementation. Our experiments show that LARC outperforms state-of-art algorithms for different kinds of workloads and extends SSD lifetime by up to 15.7 times.", "authors": [{"name": "sai huang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658987586"}, {"name": "qingsong wei", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474683541"}, {"name": "dan feng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81381599962"}, {"name": "jianxi chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81343490205"}, {"name": "cheng chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658689697"}], "title": "Improving Flash-Based Disk Cache with Lazy Adaptive Replacement", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "55\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "40\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "55\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "wuhan national lab for optoelectronics and school of computer huazhong university of science and technology wuhan china", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "sai huang"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "data storage institute aaststar agency for science technology and research innovis singapore", "city": null, "Name": "qingsong wei"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "wuhan national lab for optoelectronics and school of computer huazhong university of science and technology wuhan china", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "dan feng"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "wuhan national lab for optoelectronics and school of computer huazhong university of science and technology wuhan china", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "jianxi chen"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "data storage institute aaststar agency for science technology and research innovis singapore", "city": null, "Name": "cheng chen"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Nitin Agrawal , Vijayan Prabhakaran , Ted Wobber , John D.

Further, with the increasing trend toward multiple-die, multiple-plane architectures and high-speed interfaces, flash memory systems are expected to continue to scale and cheapen, resulting in their broader proliferation. However, when designing NAND-based devices, making decisions about the optimal system configuration is nontrivial, because flash is sensitive to a number of parameters and suffers from inherent latency variations, and no available tools suffice for studying these nuances. The parameters include the architectures, such as multidie and multiplane, diverse node technologies, bit densities, and cell reliabilities. Therefore, we introduce NANDFlashSim, a high-fidelity, latency-variation-aware, and highly configurable NAND-flash simulator, which implements a detailed timing model for 16 state-of-the-art NAND operations. Using NANDFlashSim, we notably discover the following. First, regardless of the operation, reads fail to leverage internal parallelism. Second, MLC provides lower I/O bus contention than SLC, but contention becomes a serious problem as the number of dies increases. Third, many-die architectures outperform many-plane architectures for disk-friendly workloads. Finally, employing a high-performance I/O bus or an increased page size does not enhance energy savings.

We propose a series of methods to derive groupings from data that have predictive value, informing layout decisions for data on disk.Unlike previous grouping work, we focus on dynamically identifying groupings in data that can be gathered from active systems in real time with minimal impact using spatiotemporal locality. We outline several techniques we have developed and discuss how we select particular techniques for particular workloads and application domains. Our statistical and machine-learning-based grouping algorithms answer questions such as \u201cWhat can a grouping be based on?\u201d and \u201cIs a given grouping meaningful for a given application?\u201d We design our models to be flexible and require minimal domain information so that our results are as broadly applicable as possible.

Most recent solutions to this problem allow clients to read and update (i.e., insert, modify, or delete) stored data blocks while trying to lower the overhead associated with verifying the integrity of the stored data. In this work, we develop a novel scheme, performance of which favorably compares with the existing solutions. Our solution additionally enjoys a number of new features, such as a natural support for operations on ranges of blocks, revision control, and support for multiple user access to shared content. The performance guarantees that we achieve stem from a novel data structure called abalanced update treeand removing the need for interaction during update operations in addition to communicating the updates themselves.", "authors": [{"name": "yihua zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83458958257"}, {"name": "marina blanton", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81500642625"}], "title": "Efficient Dynamic Provable Possession of Remote Data via Update Trees", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "46\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "23\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "46\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Mauritius", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of notre dame notre dame in", "city": "notre dame", "Name": "yihua zhang"}, {"country": "Mauritius", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of notre dame notre dame in", "city": "notre dame", "Name": "marina blanton"}]}}, "date": {"month": "February", "year": "2016"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Abutalib Aghayev , Peter Desnoyers, Skylight: a window on shingled disk operation, Proceedings of the 13th USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies, p.135-149, February 16-19, 2015, Santa Clara, CA\n", "Ahmed Amer , Darrell D.

To ensure consistency of such storage systems, memory writes need to be transactional and are carefully moved across the boundary between thevolatileCPU cache and thepersistentmain memory. Unfortunately, cache management in the CPU cache is hardware-controlled. Legacy transaction mechanisms, which are designed for disk-based storage systems, are inefficient in ordered data persistence of transactions in persistent memory. In this article, we propose theBlurred Persistencemechanism to reduce the transaction overhead of persistent memory by blurring the volatility-persistence boundary.Blurred Persistenceconsists of two techniques. First,Execution in Logexecutes a transaction in the log to eliminate duplicated data copies for execution. It allows persistence of the volatile uncommitted data, which are detectable with reorganized log structure. Second,Volatile Checkpoint with Bulk Persistenceallows the committed data to aggressively stay volatile by leveraging the data durability in the log, as long as the commit order across threads is kept. By doing so, it reduces the frequency of forced persistence and improves cache efficiency. Evaluations show that our mechanism improves system performance by 56.3&percnt; to 143.7&percnt; for a variety of workloads.", "authors": [{"name": "youyou lu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87259687557"}, {"name": "jiwu shu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100206550"}, {"name": "long sun", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658712816"}], "title": "Blurred Persistence: Efficient Transactions in Persistent Memory", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "133\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "29\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "133\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "china", "university": "tsinghua university", "affiliation_string": "tsinghua university beijing china", "city": "peking", "Name": "youyou lu"}, {"country": "china", "university": "tsinghua university", "affiliation_string": "tsinghua university beijing china", "city": "peking", "Name": "jiwu shu"}, {"country": "china", "university": "tsinghua university", "affiliation_string": "tsinghua university beijing china", "city": "peking", "Name": "long sun"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2853993", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "peter desnoyers", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658975414"}, {"name": "james hughes", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658975155"}], "title": "Introduction to the Special Issue onMSST2015", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "49\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "15\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "49\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "peter desnoyers"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "james hughes"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Amir G. 2011.

Creating and managing them efficiently, while maintaining flexibility and low overhead, has been a constant struggle. Although the current state-of-the-art mechanism\u2014hierarchical reference counting\u2014performs reasonably well for traditional small-file workloads, these workloads are increasingly vanishing from the enterprise data center, replaced instead with virtual machine and database workloads. These workloads center around a few very large files, violating the assumptions that allow hierarchical reference counting to operate efficiently. To better cope with these workloads, we introduce Generational Chain Trees (GCTrees), a novel method of space management that uses concepts of block lineage across snapshots rather than explicit reference counting. As a proof of concept, we create a prototype file system\u2014gcext4, a modified version of ext4 that uses GCTrees as a basis for snapshots and copy-on-write. In evaluating this prototype empirically, we find that although they have a somewhat higher overhead for traditional workloads, GCTrees have dramatically lower overhead than hierarchical reference counting for large-file workloads, improving by a factor of 34 or more in some cases. Furthermore, gcext4 performs comparably to ext4 across all workloads, showing that GCTrees impose minor cost for their benefits.", "authors": [{"name": "chris dragga", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502723130"}, {"name": "douglas j santry", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452617575"}], "title": "GCTrees: Garbage Collecting Snapshots", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "38\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "16\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "38\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "chris dragga"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "douglas j santry"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Ian F.

With today\u2019s big data and data analytics applications, some of these huge archives become active in the sense that all stored data can be accessed at any time. Running and evolving these archives is a constant tradeoff between performance, capacity, and price. We present the LoneStar RAID, a disk-based storage architecture, which focuses on high reliability, low energy consumption, and cheap reads. It is designed for MAID systems with up to hundreds of disk drives per server and is optimized for \u201cwrite once, read sometimes\u201d workloads. We use dedicated data and parity disks, and export the data disks as individually accessible buckets. By intertwining disk groups into a two-dimensional RAID and improving single-disk reliability with intradisk redundancy, the system achieves an elastic fault tolerance that can at least recover all 3-disk failures. Furthermore, we integrate a cache to offload parity updates and a journal to track the RAID\u2019s state. The LoneStar RAID scheme provides a mean time to data loss (MTTDL) that competes with today\u2019s erasure codes and is optimized to require only a minimal set of running disk drives.", "authors": [{"name": "matthias grawinkel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490668455"}, {"name": "lars nagel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442605025"}, {"name": "andre brinkmann", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100032957"}], "title": "LoneStar RAID: Massive Array of Offline Disks for Archival Systems", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "82\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "25\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "82\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "johannes gutenberg university mainz", "city": null, "Name": "matthias grawinkel"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "johannes gutenberg university mainz", "city": null, "Name": "lars nagel"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "johannes gutenberg university mainz", "city": null, "Name": "andre brinkmann"}]}}, "date": {"month": "February", "year": "2016"}}}, "Volume6": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Article No.: 16": {"references": ["Anvin, H.

This article presents a complete treatment of a class of RAID-6 codes, calledminimum density RAID-6 codes, that have an optimal blend of performance properties. There are two families of minimal density RAID-6 codes: Blaum-Roth codes and Liberation codes, and a separate special-purpose code called the Liber8tion code. The first of these have been known since the late 1990's, while the latter two are new constructions. In this article, we motivate, demonstrate, and evaluate the minimum density codes, comparing them to EVENODD and RDP codes, which represent the state-of-the-art in RAID-6.

Despite the promising physical characteristics of storage-class memory, its scale is an order of magnitude smaller than the current storage device scale. This fact makes it less than desirable for use as an independent storage device. We carefully analyze in-memory and on-disk file system objects in a log-structured file system, and exploit memory and storage aspects of the storage-class memory to overcome the drawbacks of the current log-structured file system. FRASH provides a hybrid view storage-class memory. It harbors an in-memory data structure as well as a on-disk structure. It provides nonvolatility to key data structures which have been maintained in-memory in a legacy log-structured file system. This approach greatly improves the mount latency and effectively resolves the robustness issue. By maintaining on-disk structure in storage-class memory, FRASH provides byte-addressability to the file system object and metadata for page, and subsequently greatly improves the I/O performance compared to the legacy log-structured approach. While storage-class memory offers byte granularity, it is still far slower than its DRAM counter part. We develop a copy-on-mount technique to overcome the access latency difference between main memory and storage-class memory. Our file system was able to reduce the mount time by 92&percnt; and file system I/O performance was increased by 16&percnt;.", "authors": [{"name": "jaemin jung", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81458642596"}, {"name": "youjip won", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100455351"}, {"name": "eunki kim", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81461655549"}, {"name": "hyungjong shin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81461641456"}, {"name": "byeonggil jeon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81458641965"}], "title": "FRASH: Exploiting storage class memory in hybrid file system for hierarchical storage", "citations": [{"Name": "Taeho Hwang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jaemin Jung ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Youjip Won", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jongmin Gim ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Taeho Hwang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Youjip Won ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Krishna Kant", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Haris Volos ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andres Jaan Tack ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michael M.

It has been so successful that NCQ has become the standard in SATA 2 protocol specification, and the great majority of disk vendors have adopted it for their recent disks. However, there is a possibility that the technology may lead to an information gap between the OS and a disk drive. A NCQ-enabled disk tries to optimize throughput without realizing the intention of an OS, whereas the OS does its best under the assumption that the disk will do as it is told without specific knowledge regarding the details of the disk mechanism. Let us call thisexpectation discord, which may cause serious problems such as request starvations or performance anomaly.

For these reasons, MEMS-based storage devices are suitable for battery-powered mobile systems such as PDAs. For deployment in such systems, MEMS-based storage devices must consume little energy. This work mainly targets reducing the energy consumption of this class of devices.We derive the operation modes of a MEMS-based storage device and systemically devise a policy in each mode for energy saving. Three types of policies are presented: power management, shutdown, and data-layout policy. Combined, these policies reduce the total energy consumed by a MEMS-based storage device. A MEMS-based storage device that enforces these policies comes close to Flash with respect to energy consumption and response time. However, enhancement on the device level is still needed; we present some suggestions to resolve this issue.", "authors": [{"name": "mohammed g khatib", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81381596300"}, {"name": "pieter h hartel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100346443"}], "title": "Optimizing MEMS-based storage devices for mobile battery-powered systems", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "20\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "390\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "netherlands", "university": "university of twente", "affiliation_string": "university of twente", "city": "enschede", "Name": "mohammed g khatib"}, {"country": "netherlands", "university": "university of twente", "affiliation_string": "university of twente", "city": "enschede", "Name": "pieter h hartel"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2010"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 8": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/1837915.1837916", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "randal burns", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100421114"}, {"name": "kimberly keeton", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100335285"}], "title": "Guest editorial: FAST'10", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "8\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "170\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Belize", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "johns hopkins university", "city": "hopkins", "Name": "randal burns"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "hewlett-packard labs", "city": null, "Name": "kimberly keeton"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Miriam Allalouf , Yuriy Arbitman , Michael Factor , Ronen I.

While there is some research into power-aware storage stack components, there are no systematic studies evaluating each component's impact separately. Various factors like workloads, hardware configurations, and software configurations impact the performance and energy efficiency of the system. This article evaluates the file system's impact on energy consumption and performance. We studied several popular Linux file systems, with various mount and format options, using the FileBench workload generator to emulate four server workloads: Web, database, mail, and fileserver, on two different hardware configurations. The file system design, implementation, and available features have a significant effect on CPU/disk utilization, and hence on performance and power. We discovered that default file system options are often suboptimal, and even poor. In this article we show that a careful matching of expected workloads and hardware configuration to a single software configuration\u2014the file system\u2014can improve power-performance efficiency by a factor ranging from 1.05 to 9.4 times.", "authors": [{"name": "priya sehgal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81421602258"}, {"name": "vasily tarasov", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81421595530"}, {"name": "erez zadok", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100256303"}], "title": "Optimizing energy and performance for server-class file system workloads", "citations": [{"Name": "Jim Summers ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tim Brecht ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Derek Eager ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bernard Wong", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Richard P.

Similar to a quBit (quantum bit), the particular representation of the logical data displayed by a quFile is not determined until the moment it is needed. The representation returned by a quFile is specified by a data-specific policy that can take context into account such as the application requesting the data, the device on which data is accessed, screen size, and battery status. We demonstrate the generality of the quFile abstraction by using it to implement six case studies: resource management, copy-on-write versioning, data redaction, resource-aware directories, application-aware adaptation, and platform-specific encoding. Most quFile policies were expressed using less than one hundred lines of code. Our experimental results show that, with caching and other performance optimizations, quFiles add less than 1&percnt; overhead to application-level file system.", "authors": [{"name": "kaushik veeraraghavan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332533410"}, {"name": "jason flinn", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100027306"}, {"name": "edmund b nightingale", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100272413"}, {"name": "brian noble", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100587990"}], "title": "quFiles: The right file at the right time", "citations": [{"Name": "Ji Zhang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xunfei Jiang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiao Qin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wei-Shinn Ku ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mohammed I.

We introduce I/O Deduplication, a storage optimization that utilizes content similarity for improving I/O performance by eliminating I/O operations and reducing the mechanical delays during I/O operations. I/O Deduplication consists of three main techniques:content-based caching, dynamic replica retrieval, andselective duplication. Each of these techniques is motivated by our observations with I/O workload traces obtained from actively-used production storage systems, all of which revealed surprisingly high levels of content similarity for both stored and accessed data. Evaluation of a prototype implementation using these workloads showed an overall improvement in disk I/O performance of 28 to 47&percnt; across these workloads. Further breakdown also showed that each of the three techniques contributed significantly to the overall performance improvement.", "authors": [{"name": "ricardo koller", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375600712"}, {"name": "raju rangaswami", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100519051"}], "title": "I/O Deduplication: Utilizing content similarity to improve I/O performance", "citations": [{"Name": "Zhe Zhang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Han Chen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hui Lei", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wen Xia ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hong Jiang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dan Feng ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yu Hua", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Cheng Li ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Philip Shilane ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fred Douglis ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hyong Shim ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Stephen Smaldone ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Grant Wallace", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Suganthi Dewakar ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sethuraman Subbiah ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gokul Soundararajan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mike Wilson ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mark W.

Membrane allows an operating system to tolerate a broad class of file system failures, and does so while remaining transparent to running applications; upon failure, the file system restarts, its state is restored, and pending application requests are serviced as if no failure had occurred. Membrane provides transparent recovery through a lightweight logging and checkpoint infrastructure, and includes novel techniques to improve performance and correctness of its fault-anticipation and recovery machinery. We tested Membrane with ext2, ext3, and VFAT. Through experimentation, we show that Membrane induces little performance overhead and can tolerate a wide range of file system crashes. More critically, Membrane does so with little or no change to existing file systems, thus improving robustness to crashes without mandating intrusive changes to existing file-system code.", "authors": [{"name": "swaminathan sundararaman", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332530444"}, {"name": "sriram subramanian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81458643806"}, {"name": "abhishek rajimwale", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81458657180"}, {"name": "andrea c arpaci-dusseau", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100272384"}, {"name": "remzi h arpaci-dusseau", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100272389"}, {"name": "michael m swift", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100240419"}], "title": "Membrane: Operating system support for restartable file systems", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "43\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "15\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "484\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wisconsin-madison", "city": null, "Name": "swaminathan sundararaman"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wisconsin-madison", "city": null, "Name": "sriram subramanian"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wisconsin-madison", "city": null, "Name": "abhishek rajimwale"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wisconsin-madison", "city": null, "Name": "andrea c arpaci-dusseau"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wisconsin-madison", "city": null, "Name": "remzi h arpaci-dusseau"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wisconsin-madison", "city": null, "Name": "michael m swift"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Nitin Agrawal , Vijayan Prabhakaran , Ted Wobber , John D.

Instead of using traditional layers of abstraction, our layers of abstraction are designed for directly accessing flash memory devices. DFS has two main novel features. First, it lays out its files directly in a very large virtual storage address space provided by FusionIO's virtual flash storage layer. Second, it leverages the virtual flash storage layer to perform block allocations and atomic updates. As a result, DFS performs better and is much simpler than a traditional Unix file system with similar functionalities. Our microbenchmark results show that DFS can deliver 94,000 I/O operations per second (IOPS) for direct reads and 71,000 IOPS for direct writes with the virtualized flash storage layer on FusionIO's ioDrive. For direct access performance, DFS is consistently better than ext3 on the same platform, sometimes by 20&percnt;. For buffered access performance, DFS is also consistently better than ext3, and sometimes by over 149&percnt;. Our application benchmarks show that DFS outperforms ext3 by 7&percnt; to 250&percnt; while requiring less CPU power.", "authors": [{"name": "william k josephson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319494225"}, {"name": "lars a bongo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100370097"}, {"name": "kai li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384607933"}, {"name": "david flynn", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81467657486"}], "title": "DFS: A file system for virtualized flash storage", "citations": [{"Name": "Adam H.

LSEs are a critical factor in data reliability, since a single LSE can lead to data loss when encountered during RAID reconstruction after a disk failure or in systems without redundancy. LSEs happen at a significant rate in the field [Bairavasundaram et al. 2007], and are expected to grow more frequent with new drive technologies and increasing drive capacities. While two approaches, data scrubbing and intra-disk redundancy, have been proposed to reduce data loss due to LSEs, none of these approaches has been evaluated on real field data.This article makes two contributions. We provide an extended statistical analysis of latent sector errors in the field, specifically from the view point of how to protect against LSEs. In addition to providing interesting insights into LSEs, we hope the results (including parameters for models we fit to the data) will help researchers and practitioners without access to data in driving their simulations or analysis of LSEs. Our second contribution is an evaluation of five different scrubbing policies and five different intra-disk redundancy schemes and their potential in protecting against LSEs. Our study includes schemes and policies that have been suggested before, but have never been evaluated on field data, as well as new policies that we propose based on our analysis of LSEs in the field.", "authors": [{"name": "bianca schroeder", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100252395"}, {"name": "sotirios damouras", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81464671952"}, {"name": "phillipa gill", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339501207"}], "title": "Understanding latent sector errors and how to protect against them", "citations": [{"Name": "Alexander Thomasian ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yujie Tang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yang Hu", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "28\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "364\n", "Citation Count": "5\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "canada", "university": "university of toronto", "affiliation_string": "university of toronto canada", "city": "toronto", "Name": "bianca schroeder"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of toronto", "affiliation_string": "university of toronto canada", "city": "toronto", "Name": "sotirios damouras"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of toronto", "affiliation_string": "university of toronto canada", "city": "toronto", "Name": "phillipa gill"}]}}, "date": {"month": "September", "year": "2010"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Mohamed Aboutabl , Ashok Agrawala , Jean-Dominique Decotignie, Temporally determinate disk access (extended abstract): an experimental approach, Proceedings of the 1998 ACM SIGMETRICS joint international conference on Measurement and modeling of computer systems, p.280-281, June 22-26, 1998, Madison, Wisconsin, USA[doi>10.1145/277851.277950]\n", "Bruce Allen, Monitoring hard disks with smart, Linux Journal, v.2004 n.117, p.9, January 2004\n", "Dave Anderson , Jim Dykes , Erik Riedel, More Than an Interface---SCSI vs. ATA, Proceedings of the 2nd USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies, March 31-31, 2003, San Francisco, CA\n", "Lakshmi N.

It consists of 2--4 heads, thousands of sectors per track, several hundred thousands of tracks, and tens of zones. The beginnings of adjacent tracks are placed with a certain angular offset. Sectors are placed on the tracks and accessed in some order. Angular offset and sector placement order vary widely subject to vendors and models. The success of an efficient file and storage subsystem design relies on the proper understanding of the underlying storage device characteristics. The characterization of hard disk drives has been a subject of intense research for more than a decade. The scale and complexity of state-of-the-art hard disk drive technology calls for a new way of extracting and analyzing the characteristics of the hard disk drive. In this work, we develop a novel disk characterization suite, DIG (Disk Geometry Analyzer), which allows us to rapidly extract and characterize the key performance metrics of the modern hard disk drive. Development of this tool is accompanied by thorough examination of four off-the-shelf hard disk drives. DIG consists of three key ingredients:O(1) a track boundary detection algorithm;O(logn) a zone boundary detection algorithm; and hybrid sampling based seek time profiling. We particularly focus on addressing the scalability aspect of disk characterization. With DIG, we are able to extract key metrics of hard disk drives, for example, track sizes, zone information, sector geometry and so on, within 3--20 minutes. DIG allows us to determine the sector layout mechanism of the underlying hard disk drive, for example, hybrid serpentine, cylinder serpentine, and surface serpentine, and to a build complete sector map from LBN to the three dimensional space of (Cylinder, Head, Sector). Examining the hard disk drives with DIG, we made a number of important observations. In modern hard disk drives, head switch overhead is far greater than track switch overhead. It seems that hard disk drive vendors put greater emphasis on reducing the number of head switches for data access. Most disk vendors use surface serpentine, cylinder serpentine, or hybrid serpentine schemes in laying sectors on the platters. The legacy seek time model, which takes the form ofa+b&sqrt;dleaves much to be desired for use in modern hard disk drives especially for short seeks (less than 5000 tracks). We compare the performance of the DIG against the existing state-of-the-art disk profiling algorithm. Compared to the existing state-of-the-art disk characterization algorithm, the DIG algorithm significantly decreases the time to extract comprehensive sector geometry information from 1920 minutes to 7 minutes and 1927 minutes to 180 minutes in best and worst case scenarios, respectively.", "authors": [{"name": "jongmin gim", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375617592"}, {"name": "youjip won", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100455351"}], "title": "Extract and infer quickly: Obtaining sector geometry of modern hard disk drives", "citations": [{"Name": "Balgeun Yoo ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Youjip Won ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jongmoo Choi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sungroh Yoon ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Seokhei Cho ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sooyong Kang", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dongwoo Kang ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jongmoo Choi ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Namsu Lee ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Donghee Lee ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sewoog Kim ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sam H.

It becomes increasingly important for storage systems to be able to select the matched caching policy dynamically under varying workloads. This article proposes SOPA, a cache framework to adaptively select the matched policy and perform policy switches in storage systems. SOPA encapsulates the functions of a caching policy into a module, and enables online policy switching by policy reconstruction. SOPA then selects the policy matched with the workload dynamically by collecting and analyzing access traces. To reduce the decision-making cost, SOPA proposes an asynchronous decision making process. The simulation experiments show that no single caching policy performed well under all of the different workloads. With SOPA, a storage system could select the appropriate policy for different workloads. The real-system evaluation results show that SOPA reduced the average response time by up to 20.3&percnt; and 11.9&percnt; compared with LRU and ARC, respectively.", "authors": [{"name": "yang wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81466644893"}, {"name": "jiwu shu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100206550"}, {"name": "guangyan zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81326494173"}, {"name": "wei xue", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100142594"}, {"name": "weimin zheng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81326494227"}], "title": "SOPA: Selecting the optimal caching policy adaptively", "citations": [{"Name": "Bogdan Nicolae ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Pierre Riteau ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kate Keahey", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "22\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "551\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "china", "university": "tsinghua university", "affiliation_string": "tsinghua university beijing china", "city": "peking", "Name": "yang wang"}, {"country": "china", "university": "tsinghua university", "affiliation_string": "tsinghua university beijing china", "city": "peking", "Name": "jiwu shu"}, {"country": "china", "university": "tsinghua university", "affiliation_string": "tsinghua university beijing china", "city": "peking", "Name": "guangyan zhang"}, {"country": "china", "university": "tsinghua university", "affiliation_string": "tsinghua university beijing china", "city": "peking", "Name": "wei xue"}, {"country": "china", "university": "tsinghua university", "affiliation_string": "tsinghua university beijing china", "city": "peking", "Name": "weimin zheng"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["David G.

In particular, the bit error rate (BER) of an SSD climbs as it receives more writes. As a result, RAID arrays composed from SSDs are subject to correlated failures. By balancing writes evenly across the array, RAID schemes can wear out devices at similar times. When a device in the array fails towards the end of its lifetime, the high BER of the remaining devices can result in data loss. We propose Diff-RAID, a parity-based redundancy solution that creates an age differential in an array of SSDs. Diff-RAID distributes parity blocks unevenly across the array, leveraging their higher update rate to age devices at different rates. To maintain this age differential when old devices are replaced by new ones, Diff-RAID reshuffles the parity distribution on each drive replacement. We evaluate Diff-RAID's reliability by using real BER data from 12 flash chips on a simulator and show that it is more reliable than RAID-5, in some cases by multiple orders of magnitude. We also evaluate Diff-RAID's performance using a software implementation on a 5-device array of 80 GB Intel X25-M SSDs and show that it offers a trade-off between throughput and reliability.", "authors": [{"name": "mahesh balakrishnan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81300285301"}, {"name": "asim kadav", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81443593854"}, {"name": "vijayan prabhakaran", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100181112"}, {"name": "dahlia malkhi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100572892"}], "title": "Differential RAID: Rethinking RAID for SSD reliability", "citations": [{"Name": "Yi Wang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Luis Angel D.

Typically, running benchmarks on such large disk setups is a frequent source of frustration for file-system evaluators; the scale alone acts as a strong deterrent against using larger, albeit realistic, benchmarks. To address this problem, we develop David: a system that makes it practical to run large benchmarks using modest amount of storage or memory capacities readily available on most computers. David creates a \u201ccompressed\u201d version of the original file-system image by omitting all file data and laying out metadata more efficiently; an online storage model determines the runtime of the benchmark workload on the original uncompressed image. David works under any file system, as demonstrated in this article with ext3 and btrfs. We find that David reduces storage requirements by orders of magnitude; David is able to emulate a 1-TB target workload using only an 80 GB available disk, while still modeling the actual runtime accurately. David can also emulate newer or faster devices, for example, we show how David can effectively emulate a multidisk RAID using a limited amount of memory.", "authors": [{"name": "nitin agrawal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310492162"}, {"name": "leo arulraj", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81482657982"}, {"name": "andrea c arpaci-dusseau", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100272384"}, {"name": "remzi h arpaci-dusseau", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81479645467"}], "title": "Emulating goliath storage systems with David", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "21\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "272\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "nec laboratories america", "city": null, "Name": "nitin agrawal"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wisconsin--madison", "city": null, "Name": "leo arulraj"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wisconsin--madison", "city": null, "Name": "andrea c arpaci-dusseau"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wisconsin--madison", "city": null, "Name": "remzi h arpaci-dusseau"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["Elvira Albert , Samir Genaim , Miguel G\u00f3mez-Zamalloa Gil, Live heap space analysis for languages with garbage collection, Proceedings of the 2009 international symposium on Memory management, June 19-20, 2009, Dublin, Ireland[doi>10.1145/1542431.1542450]\n", "Andrea C.

To design economically attractive and environmentally friendly parallel I/O systems, we propose an energy-aware prefetching strategy (PRE-BUD) for parallel I/O systems with disk buffers. We introduce a new architecture that provides significant energy savings for parallel I/O systems using buffer disks while maintaining high performance. There are two buffer disk configurations: (1) adding an extra buffer disk to accommodate prefetched data, and (2) utilizing an existing disk as the buffer disk. PRE-BUD is not only able to reduce the number of power-state transitions, but also to increase the length and number of standby periods. As such, PRE-BUD conserves energy by keeping data disks in the standby state for increased periods of time. Compared with the first prefetching configuration, the second configuration lowers the capacity of the parallel disk system. However, the second configuration is more cost-effective and energy-efficient than the first one. Finally, we quantitatively compare PRE-BUD with both disk configurations against three existing strategies. Empirical results show that PRE-BUD is able to reduce energy dissipation in parallel disk systems by up to 50 percent when compared against a non-energy aware approach. Similarly, our strategy is capable of conserving up to 30 percent energy when compared to the dynamic power management technique.", "authors": [{"name": "adam manzanares", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350582642"}, {"name": "xiao qin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81423594868"}, {"name": "xiaojun ruan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350569753"}, {"name": "shu yin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81440613330"}], "title": "PRE-BUD: Prefetching for energy-efficient parallel I/O systems with buffer disks", "citations": [{"Name": "Maen M.

During the archiving process, there are many submissions which are actually unchanged files that do not need to be re-archived. In this system, instead of comparing the entire files, only digests of the files are compared. Strong cryptographic hash functions with a low probability of collision can be used as digests. We propose a fast algorithm to check if a certain hash, that is, a corresponding file, is already stored in the system. The algorithm is based on dividing the whole domain of hashes into equally sized regions, and on the existence of a pointer array, which has exactly one pointer for each region. Each pointer points to the location of the first stored hash from the corresponding region and has a null value if no hash from that region exists. The entire structure can be stored in random access memory or, alternatively, on a dedicated hard disk. A statistical performance analysis has been performed that shows that in certain cases FHFEC performs nearly optimally. Extensive simulations have confirmed these analytical results. The performance of FHFEC has been compared to the performance of a binary search (BIS) and B+tree, which are commonly used in file systems and databases for table indices. The results show that FHFEC significantly outperforms both of them.", "authors": [{"name": "saso tomazic", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81324494328"}, {"name": "vesna pavlovic", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81486644501"}, {"name": "jasna milovanovic", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81486654540"}, {"name": "jaka sodnik", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81324493834"}, {"name": "anton kos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81486652313"}, {"name": "sara stancin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81486657250"}, {"name": "veljko milutinovic", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81430621159"}], "title": "Fast file existence checking in archiving systems", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "26\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "255\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "slovenia", "university": "university of ljubljana", "affiliation_string": "university of ljubljana ljubljana slovenia", "city": "ljubljana", "Name": "saso tomazic"}, {"country": "serbia", "university": "university of belgrade", "affiliation_string": "university of belgrade beograd serbia", "city": "belgrade", "Name": "vesna pavlovic"}, {"country": "serbia", "university": "university of belgrade", "affiliation_string": "university of belgrade beograd serbia", "city": "belgrade", "Name": "jasna milovanovic"}, {"country": "slovenia", "university": "university of ljubljana", "affiliation_string": "university of ljubljana ljubljana slovenia", "city": "ljubljana", "Name": "jaka sodnik"}, {"country": "slovenia", "university": "university of ljubljana", "affiliation_string": "university of ljubljana ljubljana slovenia", "city": "ljubljana", "Name": "anton kos"}, {"country": "slovenia", "university": "university of ljubljana", "affiliation_string": "university of ljubljana ljubljana slovenia", "city": "ljubljana", "Name": "sara stancin"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["Mary Baker , Satoshi Asami , Etienne Deprit , John Ouseterhout , Margo Seltzer, Non-volatile memory for fast, reliable file systems, Proceedings of the fifth international conference on Architectural support for programming languages and operating systems, p.10-22, October 12-15, 1992, Boston, Massachusetts, USA[doi>10.1145/143365.143380]\n", "Bennett, A.

This work was motivated by the modular designs of operating system components such as bus and device drivers. A filter-driver-layered caching design is proposed to resolve the performance gap among file systems and to improve their performance with the considerations of flash memory characteristics. An efficient hybrid tree structure is presented to organize and manipulate the intervals of cached writes. Algorithms are proposed in the merging, padding, and removing of the data of writes. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated with some analysis study of FAT-formatted and NTFS-formatted USB flash disks. The proposed cohesive caching policy was implemented as a filter driver in Windows XP/Vista for performance evaluation. In the experiments, a ten-fold or larger performance improvement was usually achieved when the cache size was only 64KB. Other substantial improvements were also observed in the experiments. For example, the proposed design enabled FAT-formatted and NTFS-formatted flash-memory devices to copy Linux image files 93&percnt; and 14&percnt; faster than conventional flash drives, respectively.", "authors": [{"name": "yuan-hao chang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81444592853"}, {"name": "ping-yi hsu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81486648441"}, {"name": "yung-feng lu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81312482888"}, {"name": "tei-wei kuo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452594769"}], "title": "A driver-layer caching policy for removable storage devices", "citations": [{"Name": "Bogdan Nicolae ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Pierre Riteau ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kate Keahey", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "43\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "477\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "taiwan", "university": "national taipei university of technology", "affiliation_string": "national taipei university of technology taiwan republic of china", "city": "taibei", "Name": "yuan-hao chang"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "national taiwan university", "affiliation_string": "national taiwan university taiwan republic of china", "city": "taibei", "Name": "ping-yi hsu"}, {"country": "china", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national taichung institute of technology taiwan republic of china", "city": null, "Name": "yung-feng lu"}, {"country": "taiwan", "university": "national taiwan university", "affiliation_string": "national taiwan university taiwan republic of china", "city": "taibei", "Name": "tei-wei kuo"}]}}, "date": {"month": "June", "year": "2011"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Mary Baker , Mehul Shah , David S.

Data redundancy and/or coding are used to enhance data availability, for instance, Row-diagonal parity (RDP) and EVENODD codes, which are widely used in RAID-6 storage systems, provide data availability with up totwo disk failures. To reduce the probability of data unavailability, whenever a single disk fails, disk recovery will be carried out. We find that the conventional recovery schemes of RDP and EVENODD codes for a single failed disk only use one parity disk. However, there are two parity disks in the system, and both can be used for single disk failure recovery. In this article, we propose a hybrid recovery approach that uses both parities for single disk failure recovery, and we design efficient recovery schemes for RDP code (RDOR-RDP) and EVENODD code (RDOR-EVENODD). Our recovery scheme has the following attractive properties: (1) \u201cread optimality\u201d in the sense that our scheme issues the smallest number of disk reads to recover a single failed disk and it reduces approximately 1/4 of disk reads compared with conventional schemes; (2) \u201cload balancing property\u201d in that all surviving disks will be subjected to the same (or almost the same) amount of additional workload in rebuilding the failed disk.We carry out performance evaluation to quantify the merits of RDOR-RDP and RDOR-EVENODD on some widely used disks with DiskSim. The offline experimental results show that RDOR-RDP and RDOR-EVENODD outperform the conventional recovery schemes of RDP and EVENODD codes in terms of total recovery time and recovery workload on individual surviving disk. However, the improvements are less than the theoretical value (approximately 25&percnt;), as RDOR-RDP and RDOR-EVENODD change the disk access pattern from purely sequential to a more random one compared with their conventional schemes.", "authors": [{"name": "liping xiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81464646658"}, {"name": "yinlong xu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81414608497"}, {"name": "john c s lui", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350583141"}, {"name": "qian chang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81464649359"}, {"name": "yubiao pan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490669601"}, {"name": "runhui li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490651597"}], "title": "A Hybrid Approach to Failed Disk Recovery Using RAID-6 Codes: Algorithms and Performance Evaluation", "citations": [{"Name": "Yuchong Hu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Henry C.

While many techniques are available for capturing the I/O behavior of individual application trial runs and specific components of the storage system, continuous characterization of a production system remains a daunting challenge for systems with hundreds of thousands of compute cores and multiple petabytes of storage. As a result, these storage systems are often designed without a clear understanding of the diverse computational science workloads they will support.In this study, we outline a methodology for scalable, continuous, systemwide I/O characterization that combines storage device instrumentation, static file system analysis, and a new mechanism for capturing detailed application-level behavior. This methodology allows us to identify both system-wide trends and application-specific I/O strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology by performing a multilevel, two-month study of Intrepid, a 557-teraflop IBM Blue Gene/P system. During that time, we captured application-level I/O characterizations from 6,481 unique jobs spanning 38 science and engineering projects. We used the results of our study to tune example applications, highlight trends that impact the design of future storage systems, and identify opportunities for improvement in I/O characterization methodology.", "authors": [{"name": "philip carns", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100577823"}, {"name": "kevin harms", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81447596737"}, {"name": "william allcock", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100028396"}, {"name": "charles bacon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332488740"}, {"name": "samuel lang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81440592355"}, {"name": "robert latham", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100545103"}, {"name": "robert ross", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339524985"}], "title": "Understanding and Improving Computational Science Storage Access through Continuous Characterization", "citations": [{"Name": "Michael P.

In this case, the only way to assure durability of the data is to add redundancy using either replication or erasure codes. Erasure codes are able to provide the same reliability as replication requiring much less storage space. Erasure coding breaks the data into blocks that are encoded and then stored on different nodes. However, when storage nodes permanently abandon the system, new redundant blocks must be created, which is referred to as repair. For \u201cclassical\u201d erasure codes, generating a new block requires the transmission of k blocks over the network, resulting in a high repair traffic. Recently, two new classes of erasure codes, Regenerating Codes and Hierarchical Codes, have been proposed that significantly reduce the repair traffic. Regenerating Codes reduce the amount of data uploaded by each peer involved in the repair, while Hierarchical Codes reduce the number of nodes participating in the repair. In this article we propose to combine these two codes to devise a new class of erasure codes called ER-Hierarchical Codes that combine the advantages of both.", "authors": [{"name": "zhen huang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490641747"}, {"name": "ernst biersack", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100135979"}, {"name": "yuxing peng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81322503358"}], "title": "Reducing Repair Traffic in P2P Backup Systems: Exact Regenerating Codes on Hierarchical Codes", "citations": [{"Name": "Zhen Huang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jinbang Chen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yisong Lin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Pengfei You ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yuxing Peng", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Minimizing data redundancy for high reliable cloud storage systems", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bahman Javadi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Derrick Kondo ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alexandru Iosup ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dick Epema", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "30\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "308\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "philippines", "university": "national university", "affiliation_string": "national university of defense technology", "city": "manila", "Name": "zhen huang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "ernst biersack"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ernst biersack", "city": null, "Name": "yuxing pengnational university of defense technology"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2027066.2027067", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "andre brinkmann", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82259273757"}, {"name": "david pease", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490658156"}], "title": "Guest Editorial", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "11\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "116\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "andre brinkmann"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "david pease"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["Anderson, E.2001.

However, SLA is not an effective performance interface for users to specify their required I/O service quality for two major reasons. First, for users it is difficult to determine appropriate latency and throughput bounds to ensure their required application performance without resource over-provisioning. Second, for storage system administrators it is a challenge to estimate a user\u2019s real resource demand because the specified SLA measures are not consistently correlated with the user\u2019s resource demand. This makes resource provisioning and scheduling less informative and can greatly reduce system efficiency.We propose the concept of reference storage system (RSS), which can be a storage system chosen by users and whose performance can be measured offline and mimicked online, as a performance interface between applications and storage servers. By designating an RSS to represent I/O performance requirement, a user can expect the performance received from a shared storage server servicing his I/O workload is not worse than the performance received from the RSS servicing the same workload. The storage system is responsible for implementing the RSS interface. The key enabling techniques are a machine learning model that derives request-specific performance requirements and an RSS-centric scheduling that efficiently allocates resource among requests from different users. The proposed scheme, named asYouChoose, supports the user-chosen performance interface through efficiently implementing and migrating virtual storage devices in a host storage system. Our evaluation based on trace-driven simulations shows thatYouChoosecan precisely implement the RSS performance interface, achieve a strong performance assurance and isolation, and improve the efficiency of a consolidated storage system consisting of different types of storage devices.", "authors": [{"name": "xuechen zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81440611695"}, {"name": "yuehai xu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81482648485"}, {"name": "song jiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331494953"}], "title": "YouChoose: Choosing your Storage Device as a Performance Interface to Consolidated I/O Service", "citations": [{"Name": "Dimitris Skourtis ", "Country": "netherlands", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shinpei Kato ", "Country": "netherlands", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Scott Brandt", "Country": "netherlands", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "27\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "328\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "wayne state university", "city": null, "Name": "xuechen zhang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "wayne state university", "city": null, "Name": "yuehai xu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "wayne state university", "city": null, "Name": "song jiang"}]}}, "date": {"month": "October", "year": "2011"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Atul Adya , William J.

However,manageddisk storage is still expensive. To further lower the cost, redundancy can be eliminated with the use of interfile and intrafile data compression. However, it is not clear what the optimal strategy for compressing data is, given the diverse collections of data.To create a scalable archival storage system that efficiently stores diverse data, we present PRESIDIO, a framework that selects from different space-reduction efficent storage methods (ESMs) to detect similarity and reduce or eliminate redundancy when storing objects. In addition, the framework uses a virtualized content addressable store (VCAS) that hides from the user the complexity of knowing which space-efficient techniques are used, including chunk-based deduplication or delta compression. Storing and retrieving objects are polymorphic operations independent of their content-based address. A new technique, harmonic super-fingerprinting, is also used for obtaining successively more accurate (but also more costly) measures of similarity to identify the existing objects in a very large data set that are most similar to an incoming new object.The PRESIDIO design, when reported earlier, had comprehensively introduced for the first time the notion of deduplication, which is now being offered as a service in storage systems by major vendors. As an aid to the design of such systems, we evaluate and present various parameters that affect the efficiency of a storage system using empirical data.", "authors": [{"name": "lawrence l you", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100560421"}, {"name": "kristal t pollack", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100439527"}, {"name": "darrell d e long", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81342502665"}, {"name": "k gopinath", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100624506"}], "title": "PRESIDIO: A Framework for Efficient Archival Data Storage", "citations": [{"Name": "Yan Li ", "Country": "israel", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ethan L.

Host system can achieve these benefits at the price of significant performance degradation, especially for small disk writes. We present new block-level techniques to address the performance problem of write-through caching disks. Our techniques are strongly motivated by some interesting results when the disk-level caching is turned off. By extending the conventional request merging, request bridging increases the request size and amortizes the inherent delays in the disk drive across more bytes of data. Like sector interleaving, request interleaving rearranges requests to prevent the disk head from missing the target sector position in close proximity, and thus reduces disk latency. We have evaluated our block-level approach using a variety of I/O workloads and shown that it increases disk I/O throughput by up to about 50%. For some real-world workloads, the disk performance is comparable or even superior to that of using the write-back disk cache. In practice, our simple yet effective solutions achieve better tradeoffs between data reliability and disk performance when applied to write-through caching disks.", "authors": [{"name": "dong in shin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309505247"}, {"name": "young jin yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81321500726"}, {"name": "hyeong s kim", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310487181"}, {"name": "hyeonsang eom", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100244647"}, {"name": "heon young yeom", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100161375"}], "title": "Request Bridging and Interleaving: Improving the Performance of Small Synchronous Updates under Seek-Optimizing Disk Subsystems", "citations": [{"Name": "David T.

The first scheme is the established, widely used, disk scrubbing scheme, which operates by periodically accessing disk drives to detect media-related unrecoverable errors. These errors are subsequently corrected by rebuilding the sectors affected. The second scheme is the recently proposed intradisk redundancy scheme, which uses a further level of redundancy inside each disk, in addition to the RAID redundancy across multiple disks. A new model is developed to evaluate the extent to which disk scrubbing reduces the unrecoverable sector errors. The probability of encountering unrecoverable sector errors is derived analytically under very general conditions regarding the characteristics of the read/write process of uniformly distributed random workloads and for a broad spectrum of disk scrubbing schemes, which includes the deterministic and random scrubbing schemes. We show that the deterministic scrubbing scheme is the most efficient one. We also derive closed-form expressions for the percentage of unrecoverable sector errors that the scrubbing scheme detects and corrects, the throughput performance, and the minimum scrubbing period achievable under operation with random, uniformly distributed I/O requests. Our results demonstrate that the reliability improvement due to disk scrubbing depends on the scrubbing frequency and the load of the system, and, for heavy-write workloads, may not reach the reliability level achieved by a simple interleaved parity-check (IPC)-based intradisk redundancy scheme, which is insensitive to the load. In fact, for small unrecoverable sector error probabilities, the IPC-based intradisk redundancy scheme achieves essentially the same reliability as that of a system operating without unrecoverable sector errors. For heavy loads, the reliability achieved by the scrubbing scheme can be orders of magnitude less than that of the intradisk redundancy scheme. Finally, the I/O and throughput performances are evaluated by means of analysis and event-driven simulation.", "authors": [{"name": "ilias iliadis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100203289"}, {"name": "robert haas", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100472455"}, {"name": "xiao-yu hu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351596310"}, {"name": "evangelos eleftheriou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100250134"}], "title": "Disk Scrubbing Versus Intradisk Redundancy for RAID Storage Systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Ilias Iliadis ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Vinodh Venkatesan", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mingqiang Li ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Patrick P.

Existing reliability methods, such as checksums, redundancy, or transactional updates, merely ensure that the corruption is reliably preserved. Typical workarounds, based on using backups or repairing the file system, are painfully slow. Worse, the recovery may result in further corruption.We present Recon, a system that protects file system metadata from buggy file system operations. Our approach leverages file systems that provide crash consistency using transactional updates. We define declarative statements called consistency invariants for a file system. These invariants must be satisfied by each transaction being committed to disk to preserve file system integrity. Recon checks these invariants at commit, thereby minimizing the damage caused by buggy file systems.The major challenges to this approach are specifying invariants and interpreting file system behavior correctly without relying on the file system code. Recon provides a framework for file-system specific metadata interpretation and invariant checking. We show the feasibility of interpreting metadata and writing consistency invariants for the Linux ext3 file system using this framework. Recon can detect random as well as targeted file-system corruption at runtime as effectively as the offline e2fsck file-system checker, with low overhead.", "authors": [{"name": "daniel fryer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490692697"}, {"name": "kuei sun", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502694452"}, {"name": "rahat mahmood", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502734791"}, {"name": "tinghao cheng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502654019"}, {"name": "shaun benjamin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502724231"}, {"name": "ashvin goel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367590708"}, {"name": "angela demke brown", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100014446"}], "title": "Recon: Verifying file system consistency at runtime", "citations": [{"Name": "Kuei (Jack) Sun ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daniel Fryer ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Angela Demke Brown ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ashvin Goel", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Anjo Vahldiek-Oberwagner ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Eslam Elnikety ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Aastha Mehta ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Deepak Garg ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Peter Druschel ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rodrigo Rodrigues ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Johannes Gehrke ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ansley Post", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Data loss recovery for power failure in flash memory storage systems", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "55\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "13\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "310\n", "Citation Count": "5\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "canada", "university": "university of toronto", "affiliation_string": "university of toronto", "city": "toronto", "Name": "daniel fryer"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of toronto", "affiliation_string": "university of toronto", "city": "toronto", "Name": "kuei sun"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of toronto", "affiliation_string": "university of toronto", "city": "toronto", "Name": "rahat mahmood"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of toronto", "affiliation_string": "university of toronto", "city": "toronto", "Name": "tinghao cheng"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of toronto", "affiliation_string": "university of toronto", "city": "toronto", "Name": "shaun benjamin"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of toronto", "affiliation_string": "university of toronto", "city": "toronto", "Name": "ashvin goel"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of toronto", "affiliation_string": "university of toronto", "city": "toronto", "Name": "angela demke brown"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Alphonso Labs.

Flash storage (the type most commonly used today) draws little power, and its performance is thought to exceed that of the network subsystem. In this article, we present evidence that storage performance does indeed affect the performance of several common applications such as Web browsing, maps, application install, email, and Facebook. For several Android smartphones, we find that just by varying the underlying flash storage, performance over WiFi can typically vary between 100&percnt; and 300&percnt; across applications; in one extreme scenario, the variation jumped to over 2000&percnt;. With a faster network (set up over USB), the performance variation rose even further. We identify the reasons for the strong correlation between storage and application performance to be a combination of poor flash device performance, random I/O from application databases, and heavy-handed use of synchronous writes. Based on our findings, we implement and evaluate a set of pilot solutions to address the storage performance deficiencies in smartphones.", "authors": [{"name": "hyojun kim", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100661528"}, {"name": "nitin agrawal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310492162"}, {"name": "cristian ungureanu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100061329"}], "title": "Revisiting storage for smartphones", "citations": [{"Name": "Hao Luo ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lei Tian ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hong Jiang", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lide Zhang ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "David R.

Replicating across a wide area network (WAN) is a promising alternative, but fast network connections are expensive or impractical in many remote locations, so improved compression is needed to make WAN replication truly practical. We present a new technique for replicating backup datasets across a WAN that not only eliminates duplicate regions of files (deduplication) but also compresses similar regions of files with delta compression, which is available as a feature of EMC Data Domain systems.Our main contribution is an architecture that adds stream-informed delta compression to already existing deduplication systems and eliminates the need for new, persistent indexes. Unlike techniques based on knowing a file's version or that use a memory cache, our approach achieves delta compression across all data replicated to a server at any time in the past. From a detailed analysis of datasets and statistics from hundreds of customers using our product, we achieve an additional 2X compression from delta compression beyond deduplication and local compression, which enables customers to replicate data that would otherwise fail to complete within their backup window.", "authors": [{"name": "phlip shilane", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81482656617"}, {"name": "mark huang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502641289"}, {"name": "grant wallace", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81539611956"}, {"name": "windsor hsu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502767080"}], "title": "WAN-optimized replication of backup datasets using stream-informed delta compression", "citations": [{"Name": "Yong Cui ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zeqi Lai ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xin Wang ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ningwei Dai ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Congcong Miao", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michael Mckeown ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jonathan Balkind ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "David Wentzlaff", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "49\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "285\n", "Citation Count": "7\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "backup recovery systems division emc corporation", "city": null, "Name": "phlip shilane"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "backup recovery systems division emc corporation", "city": null, "Name": "mark huang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "backup recovery systems division emc corporation", "city": null, "Name": "grant wallace"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "backup recovery systems division emc corporation", "city": null, "Name": "windsor hsu"}]}}, "date": {"month": "November", "year": "2012"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Nitin Agrawal , Vijayan Prabhakaran , Ted Wobber , John D.

The benefits of SSD's over HDD's include better durability, higher performance, and lower power consumption, but due to certain physical characteristics of NAND flash, which comprise SSD's, there are some challenging areas of improvement and further research. We focus on the layout and management of the small amount of RAM that serves as a cache between the SSD and the system that uses it. Of the techniques that have previously been proposed to manage this cache, we identify several sources of inefficient cache space management due to the way pages are clustered in blocks and the limited replacement policy. We find that in many traces hot pages reside in otherwise cold blocks, and that the spatial locality of most clusters can be fully exploited in a limited time period, so we develop a hybrid page/block architecture along with an advanced replacement policy, called BPAC, or Block-Page Adaptive Cache, to exploit both temporal and spatial locality. Our technique involves adaptively partitioning the SSD on-disk cache to separately hold pages with high temporal locality in a page list and clusters of pages with low temporal but high spatial locality in a block list. In addition, we have developed a novel mechanism for flash-based SSD's to characterize the spatial locality of the disk I/O workload and an approach to dynamically identify the set of low spatial locality clusters. We run trace-driven simulations to verify our design and find that it outperforms other popular flash-aware cache schemes under different workloads. For instance, compared to a popular flash aware cache algorithm BPLRU, BPAC reduces the number of cache evictions by up to 79.6&percnt; and 34&percnt; on average.", "authors": [{"name": "guanying wu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490665283"}, {"name": "xubin he", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451597976"}, {"name": "ben eckart", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81442619533"}], "title": "An adaptive write buffer management scheme for flash-based SSDs", "citations": [{"Name": "Dong Hyun Kang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Changwoo Min ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Young Ik Eom", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bogdan Nicolae ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Pierre Riteau ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kate Keahey", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xunfei Jiang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Maen M.

However, a single flash-based SSD cannot satisfy the capacity, performance and reliability requirements of the modern storage systems that support increasingly demanding data-intensive computing applications. Applying RAID schemes to SSDs to meet these requirements, while a logical and viable solution, faces many challenges. In this article, we propose a Hybrid Parity-based Disk Array architecture (short for HPDA), which combines a group of SSDs and two hard disk drives (HDDs) to improve the performance and reliability of SSD-based storage systems. In HPDA, the SSDs (data disks) and part of one HDD (parity disk) compose a RAID4 disk array. Meanwhile, a second HDD and the free space of the parity disk are mirrored to form a RAID1-style write buffer that temporarily absorbs the small write requests and acts as a surrogate set during recovery when a disk fails. The write data is reclaimed to the data disks during the lightly loaded or idle periods of the system. Reliability analysis shows that the reliability of HPDA, in terms of MTTDL (Mean Time To Data Loss), is better than that of either pure HDD-based or SSD-based disk array. Our prototype implementation of HPDA and the performance evaluations show that HPDA significantly outperforms either HDD-based or SSD-based disk array.", "authors": [{"name": "bo mao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81363599926"}, {"name": "hong jiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81361606829"}, {"name": "suzhen wu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81416600508"}, {"name": "lei tian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339532328"}, {"name": "dan feng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81381599962"}, {"name": "jianxi chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81343490205"}, {"name": "lingfang zeng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332537675"}], "title": "HPDA: A hybrid parity-based disk array for enhanced performance and reliability", "citations": [{"Name": "Xunfei Jiang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Maen M.

In practice, error-correcting codes use small finite fields to achieve high-throughput encoding and decoding. Conversely, cryptographic systems employ considerably larger finite fields to achieve high levels of security. We focus on developing efficient software implementations of arithmetic operations in reasonably large finite fields as needed by secure storage applications.In this article, we study several arithmetic operation implementations for finite fields ranging fromGF(232) toGF(2128). We implement multiplication and division in these finite fields by making use of precomputed tables in smaller fields, and several techniques of extending smaller field arithmetic into larger field operations. We show that by exploiting known techniques, as well as new optimizations, we are able to efficiently support operations over finite fields of interest. We perform a detailed evaluation of several techniques, and show that we achieve very practical performance for both multiplication and division.Finally, we show how these techniques find applications in the implementation of HAIL, a highly available distributed cloud storage layer. Using the newly implemented arithmetic operations inGF(264), HAIL improves its performance by a factor of two, while simultaneously providing a higher level of security.", "authors": [{"name": "jianqiang luo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81416603119"}, {"name": "kevin d bowers", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81447596807"}, {"name": "alina oprea", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100383298"}, {"name": "lihao xu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309488575"}], "title": "Efficient software implementations of large finite fieldsGF(2n) for secure storage applications", "citations": [{"Name": "James S.

This article introduces Friendstore, a system that provides inexpensive and reliable backup by giving users the choice to store backup data only on nodes they trust (typically those owned by friends and colleagues). Because it is built on trusted nodes, Friendstore is not burdened by the complexity required to cope with potentially malicious participants. Friendstore only needs to detect and repair accidental data loss and to ensure balanced storage exchange. The disadvantage of using only trusted nodes is that Friendstore cannot achieve perfect storage utilization.Friendstore is designed for a heterogeneous environment where nodes have very different access link speeds and available disk spaces. To ensure long-term data reliability, a node with limited upload bandwidth refrains from storing more data than its calculated maintainable capacity. A high bandwidth node might be limited by its available disk space. We introduce a simple coding scheme, called XOR(1,2), which doubles a node's ability to store backup information in the same amount of disk space at the cost of doubling the amount of data transferred during restore. Analysis and simulations using long-term node activity traces show that a node can reliably back up tens of gigabytes of data even with low upload bandwidth.", "authors": [{"name": "nguyen tran", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100264957"}, {"name": "frank chiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81325488204"}, {"name": "jinyang li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409597334"}], "title": "Efficient cooperative backup with decentralized trust management", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "47\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "361\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "canada", "university": "york university", "affiliation_string": "new york university", "city": "toronto", "Name": "nguyen tran"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "york university", "affiliation_string": "new york university", "city": "toronto", "Name": "frank chiang"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "york university", "affiliation_string": "new york university", "city": "toronto", "Name": "jinyang li"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Lakshmi N.

Horizontal code has the ability to adapt to the arbitrary size of a disk array but its high computational complexity is a major shortcoming. In contrast, the computational complexity of vertical code (e.g. X-code) often achieves the theoretical optimality, but vertical code is limited to using a prime number as the size of the disk array In this article, we propose a novel efficient RAID-6 code for arbitrary size of disk array: generalized X-code. We move the redundant elements along their calculation diagonals in X-code onto two specific disks and change two data elements into redundant elements in order to realize our new code. The generalized X-code achieves optimal encoding and updating complexity and low decoding complexity; in addition, it has the ability to adapt to arbitrary size of disk array. Furthermore, we also provide a method for generalizing horizontal code to achieve optimal encoding and updating complexity while keeping the code's original ability to adapt to arbitrary size of disk array.", "authors": [{"name": "xianghong luo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548005457"}, {"name": "jiwu shu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548005458"}], "title": "Generalized X-code: An efficient RAID-6 code for arbitrary size of disk array", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "24\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "261\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "china", "university": "tsinghua university", "affiliation_string": "tsinghua university china", "city": "peking", "Name": "xianghong luo"}, {"country": "china", "university": "tsinghua university", "affiliation_string": "tsinghua university china", "city": "peking", "Name": "jiwu shu"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["Abd-El-Malek, M., Wachs, M., Cipar, J., Sanghi, K., Ganger, G.

By packaging their FS implementation in a virtual machine (VM), separate from the VM that runs user applications, they can avoid the need to port the file system to each operating system (OS) and OS version. A small FS-agnostic proxy, maintained by the core OS developers, connects the FSVA to whatever OS the user chooses. This article describes an FSVA design that maintains FS semantics for unmodified FS implementations and provides desired OS and virtualization features, such as a unified buffer cache and VM migration. Evaluation of prototype FSVA implementations in Linux and NetBSD, using Xen as the virtual machine manager (VMM), demonstrates that the FSVA architecture is efficient, FS-agnostic, and able to insulate file system implementations from OS differences that would otherwise require explicit porting.", "authors": [{"name": "michael abd-el-malek", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548005462"}, {"name": "matthew wachs", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314492599"}, {"name": "james cipar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332493787"}, {"name": "karan sanghi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548005463"}, {"name": "gregory r ganger", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100209281"}, {"name": "garth a gibson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548005464"}, {"name": "michael k reiter", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81387594159"}], "title": "File system virtual appliances: Portable file system implementations", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "55\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "369\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university", "city": null, "Name": "michael abd-el-malek"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university", "city": null, "Name": "matthew wachs"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university", "city": null, "Name": "james cipar"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university", "city": null, "Name": "karan sanghi"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university", "city": null, "Name": "gregory r ganger"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university and panasas inc", "city": null, "Name": "garth a gibson"}, {"country": "Hong Kong", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of north carolina at chapel hill", "city": "north", "Name": "michael k reiter"}]}}, "date": {"month": "September", "year": "2012"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Nitin Agrawal , William J.

Driven by the increase in cost efficiency of hard drives, and the rise of the Internet, content archives have become a means of providing the public with fast, cheap access to long-term data. Unfortunately, designers of purpose-built archival systems are either forced to rely on workload behavior obtained from a narrow, anachronistic view of archives as simply cheap tertiary storage, or extrapolate from marginally related enterprise workload data and traditional library access patterns.To close this knowledge gap and provide relevant input for the design of effective long-term data storage systems, we studied the workload behavior of several systems within this expanded archival storage space. Our study examined several scientific and historical archives, covering a mixture of purposes, media types, and access models---that is, public versus private. Our findings show that, for more traditional private scientific archival storage, files have become larger, but update rates have remained largely unchanged. However, in the public content archives we observed, we saw behavior that diverges from the traditional \u201cwrite-once, read-maybe\u201d behavior of tertiary storage. Our study shows that the majority of such data is modified---sometimes unnecessarily---relatively frequently, and that indexing services such as Google and internal data management processes may routinely access large portions of an archive, accounting for most of the accesses. Based on these observations, we identify areas for improving the efficiency and performance of archival storage systems.", "authors": [{"name": "ian f adams", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81467648857"}, {"name": "mark w storer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81342512636"}, {"name": "ethan l miller", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339517516"}], "title": "Analysis of Workload Behavior in Scientific and Historical Long-Term Data Repositories", "citations": [{"Name": "Ian F.

In particular, Multi-Level Cell (MLC) flash memory, which provides a lower cost and higher density solution, has occupied the largest part of NAND flash-memory market share. However, MLC flash memory also introduces new challenges: (1) Pages in a block must be written sequentially. (2) Information to indicate a page being obsoleted cannot be recorded in its spare area due to the limitation on the number of partial programming. Since most of applications access NAND flash memory under FAT file system, this article designs an MLC Flash Translation Layer (MFTL) for flash-memory storage systems which takes constraints of MLC flash memory and access behaviors of FAT file system into consideration. A series of trace-driven simulations was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. Although MFTL is designed for MLC flash memory and FAT file system, it is applicable to SLC flash memory and other file systems as well. Our experiment results show that the proposed MFTL could achieve a good performance for various access patterns even on SLC flash memory.", "authors": [{"name": "jen-wei hsieh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351600039"}, {"name": "chung-hsien wu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474659549"}, {"name": "ge-ming chiu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100341844"}], "title": "MFTL: A Design and Implementation for MLC Flash Memory Storage Systems", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "60\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "524\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "taiwan", "university": "national taiwan university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "national taiwan university of science and technology taiwan", "city": "taibei", "Name": "jen-wei hsieh"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "chung-hsien wu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "chung-hsien wu", "city": null, "Name": "ge-ming chiunational taiwan university of science and technology taiwan"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Adaptec, Inc.2009.

We presentZBD, a block-layer driver that transparently compresses and decompresses data as they flow between the file-system and storage devices. Our system provides support for variable-size blocks, metadata caching, and persistence, as well as block allocation and cleanup.ZBDtargets maintaining high performance, by mitigating compression and decompression overheads that can have a significant impact on performance by leveraging modern multicore CPUs through explicit work scheduling. We present two case-studies for compression. First, we examine how our approach can be used to increase the capacity of SSD-based caches, thus increasing their cost-effectiveness. Then, we examine howZBDcan improve the efficiency of online disk-based storage systems.We evaluate our approach in the Linux kernel on a commodity server with multicore CPUs, using PostMark, SPECsfs2008, TPC-C, and TPC-H. Preliminary results show that transparent online block-level compression is a viable option for improving effective storage capacity, it can improve I/O performance up to 80&percnt; by reducing I/O traffic and seek distance, and has a negative impact on performance, up to 34&percnt;, only when single-thread I/O latency is critical. In particular, for SSD-based caching, our results indicate that, in line with current technology trends, compressed caching trades off CPU utilization for performance and enhances SSD efficiency as a storage cache up to 99&percnt;.", "authors": [{"name": "yannis klonatos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81460656015"}, {"name": "thanos makatos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81460657220"}, {"name": "manolis marazakis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100337981"}, {"name": "michail d flouris", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100059952"}, {"name": "angelos bilas", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100146272"}], "title": "Transparent Online Storage Compression at the Block-Level", "citations": [{"Name": "Xingbo Wu ", "Country": "israel", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zili Shao ", "Country": "israel", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Song Jiang", "Country": "israel", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "41\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "481\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "greece", "university": "university of crete", "affiliation_string": "foundation for research and technology -- hellas and university of crete", "city": "rethimnon", "Name": "yannis klonatos"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "foundation for research and technology -- hellas", "city": null, "Name": "thanos makatos"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "foundation for research and technology -- hellas", "city": null, "Name": "manolis marazakis"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "foundation for research and technology -- hellas", "city": null, "Name": "michail d flouris"}, {"country": "greece", "university": "university of crete", "affiliation_string": "foundation for research and technology -- hellas and university of crete", "city": "rethimnon", "Name": "angelos bilas"}]}}, "date": {"month": "May", "year": "2012"}}}, "Volume10": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Article No.: 16": {"references": ["AMPLab. 2013.

Due to the large amount of data they must migrate during elastic resizing, state of the art designs usually have to make painful trade-offs among performance, elasticity, and agility.This article describes the state of the art in elastic storage and a new system, called SpringFS, that can quickly change its number of active servers, while retaining elasticity and performance goals. SpringFS uses a novel technique, termedbounded write offloading, that restricts the set of servers where writes to overloaded servers are redirected. This technique, combined with the read offloading and passive migration policies used in SpringFS, minimizes the work needed before deactivation or activation of servers. Analysis of real-world traces from Hadoop deployments at Facebook and various Cloudera customers and experiments with the SpringFS prototype confirm SpringFS\u2019s agility, show that it reduces the amount of data migrated for elastic resizing by up to two orders of magnitude, and show that it cuts the percentage of active servers required by 67--82&percnt;, outdoing state-of-the-art designs by 6--120&percnt;.", "authors": [{"name": "lianghong xu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81484651051"}, {"name": "james cipar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332493787"}, {"name": "elie krevat", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100656097"}, {"name": "alexey tumanov", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81484658089"}, {"name": "nitin gupta", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81460649332"}, {"name": "michael a kozuch", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100209870"}, {"name": "gregory r ganger", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100209281"}], "title": "Agility and Performance in Elastic Distributed Storage", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "112\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "262\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university", "city": null, "Name": "lianghong xu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university", "city": null, "Name": "james cipar"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university", "city": null, "Name": "elie krevat"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university", "city": null, "Name": "alexey tumanov"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university", "city": null, "Name": "nitin gupta"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "intel labs", "city": null, "Name": "michael a kozuch"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "carnegie mellon university", "city": null, "Name": "gregory r ganger"}]}, "Article No.: 15": {"references": ["Ameen Akel , Adrian M.

But whether the technology in its current state will be a commercially and technically viable alternative to entrenched technologies such as flash-based SSDs remains undecided. To address this, it is important to consider PCM SSD devices not just from a device standpoint, but also from a holistic perspective.This article presents the results of our performance study of a recent all-PCM SSD prototype. The average latency for a 4KiB random read is 6.7\u03bcs, which is about 16\u00d7 faster than a comparable eMLC flash SSD. The distribution of I/O response times is also much narrower than flash SSD for both reads and writes. Based on the performance measurements and real-world workload traces, we explore two typical storage use cases: tiering and caching. We report that the IOPS/$ of a tiered storage system can be improved by 12--66&percnt; and the aggregate elapsed time of a server-side caching solution can be improved by up to 35&percnt; by adding PCM.Our results show that (even at current price points) PCM storage devices show promising performance as a new component in enterprise storage systems.", "authors": [{"name": "hyojun kim", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87259573657"}, {"name": "sangeetha seshadri", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339527107"}, {"name": "clement l dickey", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350598851"}, {"name": "lawrence chiu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81416605873"}], "title": "Evaluating Phase Change Memory for Enterprise Storage Systems: A Study of Caching and Tiering Approaches", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "171\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "290\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm almaden research", "city": null, "Name": "hyojun kim"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm almaden research", "city": null, "Name": "sangeetha seshadri"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm almaden research", "city": null, "Name": "clement l dickey"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm almaden research", "city": null, "Name": "lawrence chiu"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Lakshmi N.

However, traditional erasure codes employ device-level redundancy to protect against sector failures, and hence incur significant space overhead. Recent sector-disk (SD) codes are available only for limited configurations. By making a relaxed but practical assumption, we construct a general family of erasure codes calledSTAIR codes, which efficiently and provably tolerate both device and sector failures without any restriction on the size of a storage array and the numbers of tolerable device failures and sector failures. We propose theupstairs encodinganddownstairs encodingmethods, which provide complementary performance advantages for different configurations. We conduct extensive experiments on STAIR codes in terms of space saving, encoding/decoding speed, and update cost. We demonstrate that STAIR codes not only improve space efficiency over traditional erasure codes, but also provide better computational efficiency than SD codes based on our special code construction.

When such corruption occurs, offline check and recovery tools must be used, but they are error prone and cause significant downtime. Previously we showed that a runtime checker for the Ext3 file system can verify that metadata updates are consistent, helping detect corruption in metadata blocks at transaction commit time. However, corruption can still occur when a bug in the file system\u2019s transactional mechanism loses, misdirects, or corrupts writes. We show that a runtime checker must enforce the atomicity and durability properties of the file system on every write, in addition to checking transactions at commit time, to provide the strong guarantee that every block write will maintain file system consistency.We identify the invariants that need to be enforced on journaling and shadow paging file systems to preserve the integrity of committed transactions. We also describe the key properties that make it feasible to check these invariants for a file system. Based on this characterization, we have implemented runtime checkers for Ext3 and Btrfs. Our evaluation shows that both checkers detect data corruption effectively, and they can be used during normal operation with low overhead.", "authors": [{"name": "daniel fryer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490692697"}, {"name": "mike qin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658649107"}, {"name": "jack sun", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490657947"}, {"name": "kah wai lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87358873357"}, {"name": "angela demke brown", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100014446"}, {"name": "ashvin goel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367590708"}], "title": "Checking the Integrity of Transactional Mechanisms", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "53\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "121\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "canada", "university": "university of toronto", "affiliation_string": "university of toronto", "city": "toronto", "Name": "daniel fryer"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of toronto", "affiliation_string": "university of toronto", "city": "toronto", "Name": "mike qin"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of toronto", "affiliation_string": "university of toronto", "city": "toronto", "Name": "jack sun"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of toronto", "affiliation_string": "university of toronto", "city": "toronto", "Name": "kah wai lee"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of toronto", "affiliation_string": "university of toronto", "city": "toronto", "Name": "angela demke brown"}, {"country": "canada", "university": "university of toronto", "affiliation_string": "university of toronto", "city": "toronto", "Name": "ashvin goel"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/2670792", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "bianca schroeder", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100252395"}, {"name": "eno thereska", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100503356"}], "title": "Introduction to the Special Issue on USENIX FAST 2014", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "38\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "96\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "bianca schroeder"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "eno thereska"}]}}, "date": {"month": "October", "year": "2014"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Lakshmi N.

However, it reduces the performance benefit of buffer caching as journaling accounts for a bulk of the storage writes in real system environments. To relieve this problem, we present a novel buffer cache architecture that subsumes the functionality of caching and journaling by making use of nonvolatile memory such as PCM or STT-MRAM. Specifically, our buffer cache supports what we call the in-place commit scheme. This scheme avoids logging, but still provides the same journaling effect by simply altering the state of the cached block to frozen. As a frozen block still provides the functionality of a cache block, we show that in-place commit does not degrade cache performance. We implement our scheme on Linux 2.6.38 and measure the throughput and execution time of the scheme with various file I/O benchmarks. The results show that our scheme improves the throughput and execution time by 89&percnt; and 34&percnt; on average, respectively, compared to the existing Linux buffer cache with ext4 without any loss of reliability.", "authors": [{"name": "eunji lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435606651"}, {"name": "hyokyung bahn", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100385889"}, {"name": "sam h noh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87259240557"}], "title": "A Unified Buffer Cache Architecture that Subsumes Journaling Functionality via Nonvolatile Memory", "citations": [{"Name": "Andromachi Hatzieleftheriou ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Stergios V.

While consistency checkers such as fsck can detect corruption and repair a damaged image, they are generally created as an afterthought, to be run only at rare intervals. Thus, checkers operate slowly, causing significant downtime for large scale storage systems.We address this dilemma by treating the checker as a key component of the overall file system, rather than a peripheral add-on. To this end, we present a modified ext3 file system,rext3, to directly support the fast file-system checker,ffsck. Rext3 colocates and self-identifies its metadata blocks, removing the need for costly seeks and tree traversals during checking. These modifications allow ffsck to scan and repair the file system at rates approaching the full sequential bandwidth of the underlying device. In addition, we demonstrate that rext3 generally performs competitively with ext3 and exceeds it in handling random reads and large writes. Finally, we apply our principles to FreeBSD\u2019s FFS file system and its checker, doing so in a lightweight fashion that preserves the file-system layout while still providing some of the performance gains from ffsck.", "authors": [{"name": "ao ma", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87259606757"}, {"name": "chris dragga", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502723130"}, {"name": "andrea c arpaci-dusseau", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100272384"}, {"name": "remzi h arpaci-dusseau", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81479645467"}, {"name": "marshall kirk mckusick", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100459026"}], "title": "Ffsck: The Fast File-System Checker", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "93\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "13\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "305\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wisconsin madison and emc corporation", "city": "madison", "Name": "ao ma"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wisconsin madison", "city": null, "Name": "chris dragga"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wisconsin madison", "city": null, "Name": "andrea c arpaci-dusseau"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wisconsin madison", "city": null, "Name": "remzi h arpaci-dusseau"}]}}, "date": {"month": "January", "year": "2014"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 11": {"references": ["S.

By storing requested data into the buffer cache, subsequent requests can be directly serviced without accessing slow disk storage. Meanwhile, high-speed storage media like PCM (phase-change memory) have emerged recently, and one may wonder if the traditional buffer cache will be still effective for these high-speed storage media. This article answers the question by showing that the buffer cache is still effective in such environments due to the software overhead and the bimodal data access characteristics. Based on this observation, we present a new buffer cache management scheme appropriately designed for the system where the speed gap between cache and storage is narrow. To this end, we analyze the condition that caching will be effective and find the characteristics of access patterns that can be exploited in managing buffer cache for high performance storage like PCM.", "authors": [{"name": "eunji lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435606651"}, {"name": "hyokyung bahn", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100385889"}], "title": "Caching Strategies for High-Performance Storage Media", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "124\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "19\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "353\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "philippines", "university": "national university", "affiliation_string": "seoul national university", "city": "manila", "Name": "eunji lee"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Aayush Gupta , Youngjae Kim , Bhuvan Urgaonkar, DFTL: a flash translation layer employing demand-based selective caching of page-level address mappings, Proceedings of the 14th international conference on Architectural support for programming languages and operating systems, March 07-11, 2009, Washington, DC, USA[doi>10.1145/1508244.1508271]\n", "Nitin Agrawal , Vijayan Prabhakaran , Ted Wobber , John D.

Low-latency and high-IOPS solid-state drives (SSDs) cache data in front of high-capacity disks. However, most existing SSDs are designed to be a drop-in disk replacement, and hence are mismatched for use as a cache.This article describesFlashTier, a system architecture built upon asolid-state cache(SSC), which is a flash device with an interface designed for caching. Management software at the operating system block layer directs caching. The FlashTier design addresses three limitations of using traditional SSDs for caching. First, FlashTier provides a unified logical address space to reduce the cost of cache block management within both the OS and the SSD. Second, FlashTier provides a new SSC block interface to enable a warm cache with consistent data after a crash. Finally, FlashTier leverages cache behavior to silently evict data blocks during garbage collection to improve performance of the SSC.We first implement an SSC simulator and a cache manager in Linux to perform an in-depth evaluation and analysis of FlashTier's design techniques. Next, we develop a prototype of SSC on the OpenSSD Jasmine hardware platform to investigate the benefits and practicality of FlashTier design. Our prototyping experiences provide insights applicable to managing modern flash hardware, implementing other SSD prototypes and new OS storage stack interface extensions.Overall, we find that FlashTier improves cache performance by up to 168&percnt; over consumer-grade SSDs and up to 52&percnt; over high-end SSDs. It also improves flash lifetime for write-intensive workloads by up to 60&percnt; compared to SSD caches with a traditional flash interface.", "authors": [{"name": "mohit saxena", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81467646657"}, {"name": "michael m swift", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658737196"}], "title": "Design and Prototype of a Solid-State Cache", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "116\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "12\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "380\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wisconsin-madison", "city": null, "Name": "mohit saxena"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of wisconsin-madison", "city": null, "Name": "michael m swift"}]}, "Article No.: 12": {"references": ["John Bent , Garth Gibson , Gary Grider , Ben McClelland , Paul Nowoczynski , James Nunez , Milo Polte , Meghan Wingate, PLFS: a checkpoint filesystem for parallel applications, Proceedings of the Conference on High Performance Computing Networking, Storage and Analysis, November 14-20, 2009, Portland, Oregon[doi>10.1145/1654059.1654081]\n", "Tonglin Li , Xiaobing Zhou , Kevin Brandstatter , Dongfang Zhao , Ke Wang , Anupam Rajendran , Zhao Zhang , Ioan Raicu, ZHT: A Light-Weight Reliable Persistent Dynamic Scalable Zero-Hop Distributed Hash Table, Proceedings of the 2013 IEEE 27th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing, p.775-787, May 20-24, 2013[doi>10.1109/IPDPS.2013.110]\n", "John Buford. 2013.

The most flexible approach is to use storage pools that can be expanded and scaled down by adding or removing storage devices. To make this approach usable, it is necessary to provide a solution to locate data items in such a dynamic environment. This article presents and evaluates the Random Slicing strategy, which incorporates lessons learned from table-based, rule-based, and pseudo-randomized hashing strategies and is able to provide a simple and efficient strategy that scales up to handle exascale data. Random Slicing keeps a small table with information about previous storage system insert and remove operations, drastically reducing the required amount of randomness while delivering a perfect load distribution.", "authors": [{"name": "alberto miranda", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81501666083"}, {"name": "sascha effert", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81312482939"}, {"name": "yangwook kang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548033577"}, {"name": "ethan l miller", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339517516"}, {"name": "ivan popov", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81501670079"}, {"name": "andre brinkmann", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100032957"}, {"name": "tom friedetzky", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331492349"}, {"name": "toni cortes", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100254734"}], "title": "Random Slicing: Efficient and Scalable Data Placement for Large-Scale Storage Systems", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "149\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "11\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "342\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Aruba", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "barcelona supercomputing center barcelona spain", "city": "barcelona", "Name": "alberto miranda"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "sascha effert"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "yangwook kanguniversity of california santa cruz ca"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ethan l millerjohannes gutenberg-university mainz germany", "city": "mainz", "Name": "ethan l milleruniversity of california santa cruz ca"}, {"country": "United Kingdom", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "andre brinkmanndurham university durham england uk", "city": "england", "Name": "andre brinkmannjohannes gutenberg-university mainz germany"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": null, "Name": "toni cortes"}]}}, "date": {"month": "July", "year": "2014"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 8": {"references": ["Agarwal, R. and Marrow, M. 2010.

These writes are performed in units ofpages, while space is reclaimed in units of multipageerase blocks, necessitating copying of any remaining valid pages in the block before reclamation. The efficiency of this cleaning process greatly affects performance under random workloads; in particular, in SSDs, the write bottleneck is typically internal media throughput, andwrite amplificationdue to additional internal copying directly reduces application throughput.We present the first nearly-exact closed-form solution for write amplification under greedy cleaning for uniformly-distributed random traffic, validate its accuracy via simulation, and show that its inaccuracies are negligible for reasonable block sizes and overprovisioning ratios. In addition, we also present the first models which predict performance degradation for both LRW (least-recently-written) cleaning and greedy cleaning under simple nonuniform traffic conditions; simulation results show the first model to be exact and the second to be accurate within 2&percnt;. We extend the LRW model to arbitrary combinations of random traffic and demonstrate its use in predicting cleaning performance for real-world workloads.Using these analytic models, we examine the strategy of separating \u201chot\u201d and \u201ccold\u201d data, showing that for our traffic model, such separation eliminates any loss in performance due to nonuniform traffic. We then show how a system which segregates hot and cold data into different block pools may shift free space between these pools in order to achieve improved performance, and how numeric methods may be used with our model to find the optimum operating point, which approaches a write amplification of 1.0 for increasingly skewed traffic. We examine online methods for achieving this optimal operating point and show a control strategy based on our model which achieves high performance for a number of real-world block traces.", "authors": [{"name": "peter desnoyers", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81300011101"}], "title": "Analytic Models of SSD Write Performance", "citations": [{"Name": "Stephanie N.

However, the performance of restore operations from a deduplicated backup can be significantly lower than that without deduplication. The main reason lies in the fact that a file or block is split into multiple small data chunks that are often located in different disks after deduplication, which can cause a subsequent read operation to invoke many disk IOs involving multiple disks and thus degrade the read performance significantly. While this problem has been by and large ignored in the literature thus far, we argue that the time is ripe for us to pay significant attention to it in light of the emerging cloud storage applications and the increasing popularity of the VM platform in the cloud. This is because, in a cloud storage or VM environment, a simple read request on the client side may translate into a restore operation if the data to be read or a VM suspended by the user was previously deduplicated when written to the cloud or the VM storage server, a likely scenario considering the network bandwidth and storage capacity concerns in such an environment.To address this problem, in this article, we propose SAR, an SSD (solid-state drive)-Assisted Read scheme, that effectively exploits the high random-read performance properties of SSDs and the unique data-sharing characteristic of deduplication-based storage systems by storing in SSDs the unique data chunks with high reference count, small size, and nonsequential characteristics. In this way, many read requests to HDDs are replaced by read requests to SSDs, thus significantly improving the read performance of the deduplication-based storage systems in the cloud. The extensive trace-driven and VM restore evaluations on the prototype implementation of SAR show that SAR outperforms the traditional deduplication-based and flash-based cache schemes significantly, in terms of the average response times.", "authors": [{"name": "bo mao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81363599926"}, {"name": "hong jiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87658705057"}, {"name": "suzhen wu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81416600508"}, {"name": "yinjin fu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87658916757"}, {"name": "lei tian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=86158849757"}], "title": "Read-Performance Optimization for Deduplication-Based Storage Systems in the Cloud", "citations": [{"Name": "Yan-Kit Li ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Min Xu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chun-Ho Ng ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Patrick P.

It uses two-parameter Weibull distributions that allows the distributions to take on many different shapes, modeling increasing, decreasing, or constant occurrence rates. This article focuses on the statistical basis of the equation. It also presents time-based distributions of the four processes based on an extensive analysis of field data collected over several years from 10,000s of commercially available systems with 100,000s of disk drives.

In these kinds of server environments, HDD-based storage usually becomes the bottleneck of the overall system, but it is not enough to merely replace the devices with faster ones in order to exploit their high performance. In other words, proper optimizations are needed to fully utilize their performance gains. In this work, we first adopted a DRAM-based SSD as a fast backend-storage in the existing SAN environment, and found significant performance degradation compared to its own capabilities, especially in the case of small-sized random I/O pattern, even though a high-speed network was used. We have proposed three optimizations to solve this problem: (1) removing software overhead in the SAN I/O path; (2) increasing parallelism in the procedures for handling I/O requests; and (3) adopting the temporal merge mechanism to reduce network overheads. We have implemented them as a prototype and found that our approaches make substantial performance improvements by up to 39&percnt; and 280&percnt; in terms of both the latency and bandwidth, respectively.", "authors": [{"name": "jae woo choi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82659091457"}, {"name": "dong in shin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87658657257"}, {"name": "young jin yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81321500726"}, {"name": "hyeonsang eom", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100244647"}, {"name": "heon young yeom", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100161375"}], "title": "Towards High-Performance SAN with Fast Storage Devices", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "84\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "13\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "369\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "philippines", "university": "national university", "affiliation_string": "seoul national university", "city": "manila", "Name": "jae woo choi"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "", "city": null, "Name": "dong in shin"}, {"country": "philippines", "university": "national university", "affiliation_string": "dong in shinseoul national university", "city": "manila", "Name": "young jin yuseoul national university"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2014"}}}, "Volume3": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Article No.: 2": {"references": ["Bayer, R. and McCreight, E. 1972.

Serious difficulties arise when trying to use b-trees and shadowing in a single system.This article is about a set of b-tree algorithms that respects shadowing, achieves good concurrency, and implements cloning (writeable snapshots). Our cloning algorithm is efficient and allows the creation of a large number of clones.We believe that using our b-trees would allow shadowing file systems to better scale their on-disk data structures.", "authors": [{"name": "ohad rodeh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100123377"}], "title": "B-trees, shadowing, and clones", "citations": [{"Name": "Hillel Avni ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nir Shavit ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Adi Suissa", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chris Dragga ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Douglas J.

Such management involves regular movement of database objects across storage nodes in an attempt to balance the I/O bandwidth utilization across disk drives. Achieving such balance is critical for avoiding I/O bottlenecks and thereby maximizing the utilization of the storage system. However, manual management of the aforesaid task, apart from increasing administrative costs, encumbers the greater risks of untimely and erroneous operations. We address the preceding concerns with STORM, an automated approach that combines low-overhead information gathering of database access and storage usage patterns with efficient analysis to generate accurate and timely hints for the administrator regarding data movement operations. STORM's primary objective is minimizing the volume of data movement required (to minimize potential down-time or reduction in performance) during the reconfiguration operation, with the secondary constraints of space and balanced I/O-bandwidth-utilization across the storage devices. We analyze and evaluate STORM theoretically, using a simulation framework, as well as experimentally. We show that the dynamic data layout reconfiguration problem is NP-hard and we present a heuristic that provides an approximate solution inO(Nlog(N/M) &plus; (N/M)2) time, whereMis the number of storage devices andNis the total number of database objects residing in the storage devices. A simulation study shows that the heuristic converges to an acceptable solution that is successful in balancing storage utilization with an accuracy that lies within 7&percnt; of the ideal solution. Finally, an experimental study demonstrates that the STORM approach can improve the overall performance of the TPC-C benchmark by as much as 22&percnt;, by reconfiguring an initial random, but evenly distributed, placement of database objects.", "authors": [{"name": "kaushik dutta", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100634452"}, {"name": "raju rangaswami", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100519051"}, {"name": "sajib kundu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81346488914"}], "title": "Workload-based generation of administrator hints for optimizing database storage utilization", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "15\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "642\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "philippines", "university": "national university", "affiliation_string": "florida international university miami fl", "city": "manila", "Name": "kaushik dutta"}, {"country": "philippines", "university": "national university", "affiliation_string": "florida international university miami fl", "city": "manila", "Name": "raju rangaswami"}, {"country": "philippines", "university": "national university", "affiliation_string": "florida international university miami fl", "city": "manila", "Name": "sajib kundu"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["Aguilera, M. and Fr\u00f8lund, S. 2003.

But we believe Niobe is significantly morepracticalfor large-scale enterprise storage than previously published protocols. In particular, Niobe is simple, flexible, has rigorously proven yet simply stated consistency guarantees, and exhibits excellent performance. Niobe has been deployed as the backend for a commercial Internet service; its consistency properties have been proved formally from first principles, and further verified using the TLA &plus; specification language.

In such a shared service, requests from different users have different associated performance objectives and utilities, in accordance with the negotiated service-level agreements (SLAs). Service providers typically provision resources only for average workload intensity, so it becomes important to handle workload surges in a way that maximizes the utility of the served requests.We capture the performance objectives and utilities associated with these multiclass diverse workloads in a unified framework and formulate the disk scheduling problem as a reward maximization problem. We map the reward maximization problem to a minimization problem on graphs and, by novel use of graph-theoretic techniques, design a scheduling algorithm that is computationally efficient and optimal in the class of seek-optimizing algorithms. Comprehensive experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other disk schedulers under all loads, with the performance improvement approaching 100&percnt; under certain high load conditions. In contrast to existing schedulers, the proposed scheduler is extensible to new performance objectives (workload type) and utilities by simply altering the reward functions associated with the requests.", "authors": [{"name": "akshat verma", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100404488"}, {"name": "rohit jain", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100114095"}, {"name": "sugata ghosal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81337489512"}], "title": "A utility-based unified disk scheduling framework for shared mixed-media services", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "8\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "369\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "India", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm india research lab new delhi india", "city": "delhi", "Name": "akshat verma"}, {"country": "India", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm india research lab new delhi india", "city": "delhi", "Name": "rohit jain"}, {"country": "India", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm india research lab new delhi india", "city": "delhi", "Name": "sugata ghosal"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Abadi, D.

In such systems, both incoming data and intermediate results may need to be stored to enable analyses at unknown future times. The quantity of data of potential use would dominate even the largest storage system. Thus, a mechanism is needed to keep the data most likely to be used. One recently introduced approach is to employ retention value functions, which effectively assign each data object a value that changes over time in a prespecified way &lsqb;Douglis et al.2004&rsqb;. Storage space for data entering the system is reclaimed automatically by deleting data of the lowest current value. In such large systems, there will naturally be multiple file systems available, each with different properties. Choosing the right file system for a given incoming stream of data presents a challenge. In this article we provide a novel and effective scheme for optimizing the placement of data within a distributed storage subsystem employing retention value functions. The goal is to keep the data of highest overall value, while simultaneously balancing the read load to the file system. The key aspects of such a scheme are quite different from those that arise in traditional file assignment problems. We further motivate this optimization problem and describe a solution, comparing its performance to other reasonable schemes via simulation experiments.", "authors": [{"name": "kirsten hildrum", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339504302"}, {"name": "fred douglis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100470359"}, {"name": "joel l wolf", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100335048"}, {"name": "philip s yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350576309"}, {"name": "lisa fleischer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100325898"}, {"name": "akshay katta", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81346488815"}], "title": "Storage optimization for large-scale distributed stream-processing systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Joel Wolf ", "Country": "belgium", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nikhil Bansal ", "Country": "belgium", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kirsten Hildrum ", "Country": "belgium", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sujay Parekh ", "Country": "belgium", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Deepak Rajan ", "Country": "belgium", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rohit Wagle ", "Country": "belgium", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kun-Lung Wu ", "Country": "belgium", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lisa Fleischer", "Country": "belgium", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Archan Misra ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Marion Blount ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Anastasios Kementsietsidis ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daby Sow ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Min Wang", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Advances and Challenges for Scalable Provenance in Stream Processing Systems", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rohit Khandekar ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kirsten Hildrum ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sujay Parekh ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Deepak Rajan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Joel Wolf ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kun-Lung Wu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Henrique Andrade ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bu\u011fra Gedik", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rohit Khandekar ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kirsten Hildrum ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sujay Parekh ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Deepak Rajan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Joel Wolf ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kun-Lung Wu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Henrique Andrade ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bu\u011fra Gedik", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "24\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "6260\n", "Citation Count": "5\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm t j watson research center yorktown heights ny", "city": null, "Name": "kirsten hildrum"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm t j watson research center yorktown heights ny", "city": null, "Name": "fred douglis"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm t j watson research center yorktown heights ny", "city": null, "Name": "joel l wolf"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm t j watson research center yorktown heights ny", "city": null, "Name": "philip s yu"}, {"country": "Jamaica", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "dartmouth college hanover nh", "city": "hanover", "Name": "lisa fleischer"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "amazon corporation seattle wa", "city": "seattle", "Name": "akshay katta"}]}}, "date": {"month": "February", "year": "2008"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Alemany, J. and Thathachar, J.

Because many systems are nonstoppable when their storage capacity and I/O bandwidth need increasing, an efficient and online mechanism to add more disks to striped volumes is very important. In this article, it is presented and proved that during data redistribution caused by scaling a round-robin striped volume, there is always a reordering window where data consistency can be maintained while changing the order of data movements. Furthermore, by exploiting the reordering window characteristic, SLAS is proposed to scale round-robin striped volumes, which reduces the cost of data redistribution effectively. First, SLAS applies a new mapping management solution based on a sliding window to support data redistribution without loss of scalability; second, it uses lazy updates of mapping metadata to decrease the number of metadata writes required by data redistribution; third, it changes the order of data chunk movements to aggregate reads/writes of data chunks. Our results from detailed simulations using real-system workloads show that, compared with the traditional approach, SLAS can reduce redistribution duration by up to 40.79&percnt; with similar maximum response time of foreground I/Os. Finally, our discussion indicates that the SLAS approach works for both disk addition and disk removal to/from striped volumes.", "authors": [{"name": "guangyan zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81326494173"}, {"name": "jiwu shu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100206550"}, {"name": "wei xue", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100142594"}, {"name": "weimin zheng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81326494227"}], "title": "SLAS: An efficient approach to scaling round-robin striped volumes", "citations": [{"Name": "Weimin Zheng ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Guangyan Zhang", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "J.

Z-RAID improves the performance of traditional RAID by utilizing the zoning property of modern disks which provides multiple zones with different data transfer rates within a disk. Z-RAID levels 1, 5, and 6 are introduced to enhance the effective data transfer rate of RAID levels 1, 5, and 6, respectively, by constraining the placement of data blocks in multizone disks. We apply the Z-RAID to a practical and popular application, streaming media server, that requires a high-data transfer rate as well as a high reliability. The analytical and experimental results demonstrate the superiority of Z-RAID to conventional RAID. Z-RAID provides a higher effective data transfer rate in normal mode with no disadvantage.

More than 110,000 disks are covered by this data, some for an entire lifetime of five years. The data includes drives with SCSI and FC, as well as SATA interfaces. The mean time-to-failure (MTTF) of those drives, as specified in their datasheets, ranges from 1,000,000 to 1,500,000 hours, suggesting a nominal annual failure rate of at most 0.88&percnt;.We find that in the field, annual disk replacement rates typically exceed 1&percnt;, with 2--4&percnt; common and up to 13&percnt; observed on some systems. This suggests that field replacement is a fairly different process than one might predict based on datasheet MTTF.We also find evidence, based on records of disk replacements in the field, that failure rate is not constant with age, and that rather than a significant infant mortality effect, we see a significant early onset of wear-out degradation. In other words, the replacement rates in our data grew constantly with age, an effect often assumed not to set in until after a nominal lifetime of 5 years.Interestingly, we observe little difference in replacement rates between SCSI, FC, and SATA drives, potentially an indication that disk-independent factors such as operating conditions affect replacement rates more than component-specific ones. On the other hand, we see only one instance of a customer rejecting an entire population of disks as a bad batch, in this case because of media error rates, and this instance involved SATA disks.Time between replacement, a proxy for time between failure, is not well modeled by an exponential distribution and exhibits significant levels of correlation, including autocorrelation and long-range dependence.", "authors": [{"name": "bianca schroeder", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100252395"}, {"name": "garth a gibson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339501408"}], "title": "Understanding disk failure rates: What does an MTTF of 1,000,000 hours mean to you?", "citations": [{"Name": "Alma Riska ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Erik Riedel", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Daniel A.

We study the most widely used class of prefetching algorithms known assequential prefetching. There are two problems that plague the state-of-the-art sequential prefetching algorithms: (i)cache pollution, which occurs when prefetched data replaces more useful prefetched or demand-paged data, and (ii)prefetch wastage, which happens when prefetched data is evicted from the cache before it can be used.A sequential prefetching algorithm can have a fixed or adaptive degree of prefetch and can be either synchronous (when it can prefetch only on a miss) or asynchronous (when it can also prefetch on a hit). To capture these distinctions we define four classes of prefetching algorithms: fixed synchronous (FS), fixed asynchronous (FA), adaptive synchronous (AS), and adaptive asynchronous (AsynchA). We find that the relatively unexplored class of AsynchA algorithms is in fact the most promising for sequential prefetching. We provide a first formal analysis of the criteria necessary for optimal throughput when using an AsynchA algorithm in a cache shared by multiple steady sequential streams. We then provide a simple implementation called AMP (adaptive multistream prefetching) which adapts accordingly, leading to near-optimal performance for any kind of sequential workload and cache size.Our experimental setup consisted of an IBM xSeries 345 dual processor server running Linux using five SCSI disks. We observe that AMP convincingly outperforms all the contending members of the FA, FS, and AS classes for any number of streams and over all cache sizes. As anecdotal evidence, in an experiment with 100 concurrent sequential streams and varying cache sizes, AMP surpasses the FA, FS, and AS algorithms by 29--172&percnt;, 12--24&percnt;, and 21--210&percnt;, respectively, while outperforming OBL by a factor of 8. Even for complex workloads like SPC1-Read, AMP is consistently the best-performing algorithm. For the SPC2 video-on-demand workload, AMP can sustain at least 25&percnt; more streams than the next best algorithm. Furthermore, for a workload consisting of short sequences, where optimality is more elusive, AMP is able to outperform all the other contenders in overall performance.Finally, we implemented AMP in the state-of-the-art enterprise storage system, the IBM system storage DS8000 series. We demonstrated that AMP dramatically improves performance for common sequential and batch processing workloads and delivers up to a twofold increase in the sequential read capacity.", "authors": [{"name": "binny s gill", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330491258"}, {"name": "luis angel d bathen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319488453"}], "title": "Optimal multistream sequential prefetching in a shared cache", "citations": [{"Name": "Patrick Anthony La Fratta ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Peter M.

Applications such as SETI&commat;home, Folding&commat;home, and Freenet are now in wide use and provide a variety of services, including data processing and content distribution. However, while several research projects have proposed contributory applications that support peer-to-peer storage systems, their adoption has been comparatively limited. We believe that a key barrier to the adoption of contributory storage systems is that contributing a large quantity of local storage interferes with the principal user of the machine.To overcome this barrier, we introduce the Transparent File System (TFS). TFS provides background tasks with large amounts of unreliable storage\u2014all of the currently available space\u2014without impacting the performance of ordinary file access operations. We show that TFS allows a peer-to-peer contributory storage system to provide 40&percnt; more storage at twice the performance when compared to a user-space storage mechanism. We analyze the impact of TFS on replication in peer-to-peer storage systems and show that TFS does not appreciably increase the resources needed for file replication.", "authors": [{"name": "james cipar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332493787"}, {"name": "mark d corner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81410595346"}, {"name": "emery d berger", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100228645"}], "title": "Contributing storage using the transparent file system", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "18\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "508\n", "Citation Count": "1\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of massachusetts amherst ma", "city": null, "Name": "james cipar"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of massachusetts amherst ma", "city": null, "Name": "mark d corner"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of massachusetts amherst ma", "city": null, "Name": "emery d berger"}]}, "Article No.: 13": {"references": ["Michael Abd-El-Malek , William V.

For a typical data center, storage accounts for 27&percnt; of energy consumption. Conventional server-class RAIDs cannot easily reduce power because loads are balanced to use all disks, even for light loads.We have built the power-aware RAID (PARAID), which reduces energy use of commodity server-class disks without specialized hardware. PARAID uses a skewed striping pattern to adapt to the system load by varying the number of powered disks. By spinning disks down during light loads, PARAID can reduce power consumption, while still meeting performance demands, by matching the number of powered disks to the system load. Reliability is achieved by limiting disk power cycles and using different RAID encoding schemes. Based on our five-disk prototype, PARAID uses up to 34&percnt; less power than conventional RAIDs while achieving similar performance and reliability.", "authors": [{"name": "charles weddle", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81414616075"}, {"name": "mathew oldham", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81414615546"}, {"name": "jin qian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339523297"}, {"name": "an-i andy wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384595010"}, {"name": "peter reiher", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100172039"}, {"name": "geoff kuenning", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100529705"}], "title": "PARAID: A gear-shifting power-aware RAID", "citations": [{"Name": "Tseng-Yi Chen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tsung-Tai Yeh ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hsin-Wen Wei ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yu-Xun Fang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wei-Kuan Shih ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tsan-sheng Hsu", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kevin M.

CATS offers a simple web services interface that allows clients to read and write opaque objects of variable size. This interface is similar to the one offered by existing commercial Internet storage services. CATS extends the functionality of commercial Internet storage services by offering support for strong accountability.A CATS server annotates read and write responses with evidence of correct execution, and offers audit and challenge interfaces that enable clients to verify that the server is faithful. A faulty server cannot conceal its misbehavior, and evidence of misbehavior is independently verifiable by any participant. CATS clients are also accountable for their actions on the service. A client cannot deny its actions, and the server can prove the impact of those actions on the state views it presented to other clients.Experiments with a CATS prototype evaluate the cost of accountability under a range of conditions and expose the primary factors influencing the level of assurance and the performance of a strongly accountable storage server. The results show that strong accountability is practical for network storage systems in settings with strong identity and modest degrees of write-sharing. We discuss how the accountability concepts and techniques used in CATS generalize to other classes of network services.", "authors": [{"name": "aydan r yumerefendi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310492132"}, {"name": "jeffrey s chase", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100059540"}], "title": "Strong accountability for network storage", "citations": [{"Name": "Chen Wang ", "Country": "mexico", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Surya Nepal ", "Country": "mexico", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shiping Chen ", "Country": "mexico", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "John Zic", "Country": "mexico", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Cooperative Data Management Services Based on Accountable Contract", "Country": "mexico", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Proceedings of the OTM 2008 Confederated International Conferences", "Country": "mexico", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "CoopIS", "Country": "mexico", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "DOA", "Country": "mexico", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "GADA", "Country": "mexico", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "IS", "Country": "mexico", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Carlos Molina-Jimenez ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nick Cook ", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Santosh Shrivastava", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "On the Feasibility of Bilaterally Agreed Accounting of Resource Consumption", "Country": "australia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Paul T.

We find significant temporal trends relating to the popularity of certain file types, the origin of file content, the way the namespace is used, and the degree of variation among file systems, as well as more pedestrian changes in size and capacities. We give examples of consequent lessons for designers of file systems and related software.", "authors": [{"name": "nitin agrawal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81537675256"}, {"name": "william j bolosky", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100166163"}, {"name": "john r douceur", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100470363"}, {"name": "jacob r lorch", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100346855"}], "title": "A five-year study of file-system metadata", "citations": [{"Name": "Yousuke Watanabe ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kenichi Otagiri ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Haruo Yokota", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Anjo Vahldiek-Oberwagner ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Eslam Elnikety ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Aastha Mehta ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Deepak Garg ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Peter Druschel ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rodrigo Rodrigues ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Johannes Gehrke ", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ansley Post", "Country": "france", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michael Vrable ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Stefan Savage ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Geoffrey M.

To achieve high disk throughput, disk drives must be accessed with large IOs to amortize disk access overhead. Large IOs imply an increased requirement of expensive DRAM, and, consequently, greater overall system cost. MEMS-based storage, an emerging storage technology, is predicted to offer a price-performance point between those of DRAM and disk drives. In this study, we propose storage architectures that use the relatively inexpensive MEMS-based storage devices as an intermediate layer (between DRAM and disk drives) for temporarily staging large disk IOs at a significantly lower cost. We present data layout mechanisms and synchronized IO scheduling algorithms for the real-time storage and retrieval of streaming data within such an augmented storage system. Analytical evaluation suggests that MEMS-augmented storage hierarchies can reduce the cost and improve the throughput of streaming servers significantly.", "authors": [{"name": "raju rangaswami", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100519051"}, {"name": "zoran dimitrijevic", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100002967"}, {"name": "edward chang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81344489120"}, {"name": "klaus schauser", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100173101"}], "title": "Building MEMS-based storage systems for streaming media", "citations": [{"Name": "Mohammed G.

Databases, on the other hand, have long provided transactions. Transactions are useful because they provide atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID). Many applications could make use of these semantics, but databases have a wide variety of nonstandard interfaces. For example, applications like mail servers currently perform elaborate error handling to ensure atomicity and consistency, because it is easier than using a DBMS. A transaction-oriented programming model eliminates complex error-handling code because failed operations can simply be aborted without side effects. We have designed a file system that exports ACID transactions to user-level applications, while preserving the ubiquitous and convenient POSIX interface. In our prototype ACID file system, called Amino, updated applications can protect arbitrary sequences of system calls within a transaction. Unmodified applications operate without any changes, but each system call is transaction protected. We also built a recoverable memory library with support for nested transactions to allow applications to keep their in-memory data structures consistent with the file system. Our performance evaluation shows that ACID semantics can be added to applications with acceptable overheads. When Amino adds atomicity, consistency, and isolation functionality to an application, it performs close to Ext3. Amino achieves durability up to 46&percnt; faster than Ext3, thanks to improved locality.", "authors": [{"name": "charles p wright", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330500224"}, {"name": "richard spillane", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331504942"}, {"name": "gopalan sivathanu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100040525"}, {"name": "erez zadok", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100256303"}], "title": "Extending ACID semantics to the file system", "citations": [{"Name": "Khaled Alghathbar ", "Country": "turkey", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alaaeldin M.

Unfortunately, spatial locality of cached blocks is largely ignored, and only temporal locality is considered in current system buffer cache managements. Thus, disk performance for workloads without dominant sequential accesses can be seriously degraded. To address this problem, we propose a scheme calledDULO(DUalLOcality) which exploits both temporal and spatial localities in the buffer cache management. Leveraging the filtering effect of the buffer cache, DULO can influence the I/O request stream by making the requests passed to the disk more sequential, thus significantly increasing the effectiveness of I/O scheduling and prefetching for disk performance improvements.We have implemented a prototype of DULO in Linux 2.6.11. The implementation shows that DULO can significantly increases disk I/O throughput for real-world applications such as a Web server, TPC benchmark, file system benchmark, and scientific programs.

First, FastScale minimizes data migration, while maintaining a uniform data distribution. It moves only enough data blocks from old disks to fill an appropriate fraction of new disks. Second, FastScale optimizes data migration with access aggregation and lazy checkpoint. Access aggregation enables data migration to have a larger throughput due to a decrement of disk seeks. Lazy checkpoint minimizes the number of metadata writes without compromising data consistency. Using several real system disk traces, we evaluate the performance of FastScale through comparison with SLAS, one of the most efficient existing scaling approaches. The experiments show that FastScale can reduce redistribution time by up to 86.06&percnt; with smaller application I/O latencies. The experiments also illustrate that the performance of RAID-0 scaled using FastScale is almost identical to, or even better than, that of the round-robin RAID-0.", "authors": [{"name": "guangyan zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81326494173"}, {"name": "weimin zheng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81326494227"}, {"name": "keqin li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452603817"}], "title": "Design and Evaluation of a New Approach to RAID-0 Scaling", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "32\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "181\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "china", "university": "tsinghua university", "affiliation_string": "tsinghua university", "city": "peking", "Name": "guangyan zhang"}, {"country": "china", "university": "tsinghua university", "affiliation_string": "tsinghua university", "city": "peking", "Name": "weimin zheng"}, {"country": "china", "university": "tsinghua university", "affiliation_string": "state university of new york and tsinghua university", "city": "peking", "Name": "keqin li"}]}, "Article No.: 14": {"references": ["Micah Adler , Michael Mitzenmacher, Towards Compressing Web Graphs, Proceedings of the Data Compression Conference, p.203, March 27-29, 2001\n", "Roger S.

Provenance provides new functionality in a variety of areas, including experimental documentation, debugging, search, and security. As a result, a number of groups have built systems to capture provenance. Most of these systems focus on provenance collection, a few systems focus on building applications that use the provenance, but all of these systems ignore an important aspect: efficient long-term storage of provenance.In this article, we first analyze the provenance collected from multiple workloads and characterize the properties of provenance with respect to long-term storage. We then propose a hybrid scheme that takes advantage of the graph structure of provenance data and the inherent duplication in provenance data. Our evaluation indicates that our hybrid scheme, a combination of Web graph compression (adapted for provenance) and dictionary encoding, provides the best trade-off in terms of compression ratio, compression time, and query performance when compared to other compression schemes.", "authors": [{"name": "yulai xie", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548928056"}, {"name": "kiran-kumar muniswamy-reddy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310489936"}, {"name": "dan feng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81381599962"}, {"name": "yan li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84459591757"}, {"name": "darrell d e long", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548017669"}], "title": "Evaluation of a Hybrid Approach for Efficient Provenance Storage", "citations": [{"Name": "Adam Bates ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kevin R.

Medical record databases, large biomedical datasets, historical information about power systems and financial data are some examples of critical data that could be moved to the cloud. However, the reliability and security of data stored in the cloud still remain major concerns. In this work we present DepSky, a system that improves the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of information stored in the cloud through the encryption, encoding, and replication of the data on diverse clouds that form a cloud-of-clouds. We deployed our system using four commercial clouds and used PlanetLab to run clients accessing the service from different countries. We observed that our protocols improved the perceived availability, and in most cases, the access latency, when compared with cloud providers individually. Moreover, the monetary costs of using DepSky in this scenario is at most twice the cost of using a single cloud, which is optimal and seems to be a reasonable cost, given the benefits.", "authors": [{"name": "alysson bessani", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100012489"}, {"name": "miguel correia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100398333"}, {"name": "bruno quaresma", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81484655406"}, {"name": "fernando andre", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81484650403"}, {"name": "paulo sousa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81407594165"}], "title": "DepSky: Dependable and Secure Storage in a Cloud-of-Clouds", "citations": [{"Name": "Alysson Bessani ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Leucio A.

To overcome the poor performance of MLC flash memory, a system architecture has been designed to optimize chip-level parallelism. This design increases the size of the page unit and the block unit, thereby simultaneously executing operations on multiple chips. Unfortunately, its Flash Translation Layer (FTL) generates many unused sectors in each page, which leads to unnecessary write operations. Furthermore, it reuses an earlier log block scheme, although it generates many erase operations because of its low space utilization. To solve these problems, we propose a hybrid associative FTL (Hybrid-FTL) to enhance the performance of the chip-level parallel flash memory system. Hybrid-FTL reduces the number of write operations by utilizing all of the unused sectors. Furthermore, it reduces the overall number of erase operations by classifying data as hot, cold, or fragment data. Hybrid-FTL requires less mapping information in the DRAM and in the flash memory compared with previous FTL algorithms.", "authors": [{"name": "se jin kwon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81493654421"}, {"name": "hyung-ju cho", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81555822056"}, {"name": "tae-sun chung", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84459121957"}], "title": "Hybrid Associative Flash Translation Layer for the Performance Optimization of Chip-Level Parallel Flash Memory", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "60\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "289\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "korea south", "university": "ajou university", "affiliation_string": "ajou university", "city": "suwon", "Name": "se jin kwon"}, {"country": "korea south", "university": "ajou university", "affiliation_string": "ajou university", "city": "suwon", "Name": "hyung-ju cho"}, {"country": "korea south", "university": "ajou university", "affiliation_string": "ajou university", "city": "suwon", "Name": "tae-sun chung"}]}}, "date": {"month": "November", "year": "2013"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Michael Abd-El-Malek , William V.

Aiming at this goal, two new classes of erasure-resilient codes are introduced -- Basic Pyramid Codes (BPC) and Generalized Pyramid Codes (GPC). Both schemes require slightly more storage space than conventional schemes, but significantly improve the critical performance of read during failures and unavailability.As a by-product, we establish a necessary matching condition to characterize the limit of failure recovery, that is, unless the matching condition is satisfied, a failure case is impossible to recover. In addition, we define a maximally recoverable (MR) property. For all ERC schemes holding the MR property, the matching condition becomes sufficient, that is, all failure cases satisfying the matching condition are indeed recoverable. We show that GPC is thefirstclass of non-MDS schemes holding the MR property.", "authors": [{"name": "cheng huang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330492634"}, {"name": "minghua chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81554696056"}, {"name": "jin li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81555395556"}], "title": "Pyramid Codes: Flexible Schemes to Trade Space for Access Efficiency in Reliable Data Storage Systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Mingyuan Xia ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mohit Saxena ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mario Blaum ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "David A.

Demanding systems typically dedicate separate devices to logging for adequate performance during normal operation and redundancy during state reconstruction. However, storage stacks enforce page-sized granularity in data transfers from memory to disk. Thus, they consume excessive storage bandwidth to handle small writes, which hurts performance. The problem becomes worse, as filesystems often handle multiple concurrent streams, which effectively generate random I/O traffic. In a journaled filesystem, we introducewasteless journalingas a mount mode that coalesces synchronous concurrent small writes of data into full page-sized journal blocks. Additionally, we proposeselective journalingto automatically activate wasteless journaling on data writes with size below a fixed threshold. We implemented a functional prototype of our design over a widely-used filesystem. Our modes are compared against existing methods using microbenchmarks and application-level workloads on stand-alone servers and a multitier networked system. We examine synchronous and asynchronous writes. Coalescing small data updates to the journal sequentially preserves filesystem consistency while it reduces consumed bandwidth up to several factors, decreases recovery time up to 22&percnt;, and lowers write latency up to orders of magnitude.", "authors": [{"name": "andromachi hatzieleftheriou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81487654424"}, {"name": "stergios v anastasiadis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100555639"}], "title": "Improving Bandwidth Efficiency for Consistent Multistream Storage", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "41\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "328\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "greece", "university": "university of ioannina", "affiliation_string": "university of ioannina", "city": "ioannina", "Name": "andromachi hatzieleftheriou"}, {"country": "greece", "university": "university of ioannina", "affiliation_string": "university of ioannina", "city": "ioannina", "Name": "stergios v anastasiadis"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["Abd-El-Malek, M., Ii, W.

At such a scale, these storage systems face two key challenges: (1) hot-spots due to the dynamic popularity of stored objects; and (2) high operational costs due to power and cooling. Existing storage solutions, however, are unsuitable to address these challenges because of the large number of servers and data objects. This article describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of Ursa, a system that scales to a large number of storage nodes and objects, and aims to minimize latency and bandwidth costs during system reconfiguration. Toward this goal, Ursa formulates an optimization problem that selects a subset of objects from hot-spot servers and performstopology-awaremigration to minimize reconfiguration costs. As exact optimization is computationally expensive, we devise scalable approximation techniques for node selection and efficient divide-and-conquer computation. We also show that the same dynamic reconfiguration techniques can be leveraged to reduce power costs by dynamically migrating data off under-utilized nodes, and powering up servers neighboring existing hot-spots to reduce reconfiguration costs. Our evaluation shows that Ursa achieves cost-effective load management, is time-responsive in computing placement decisions (e.g., about two minutes for 10K nodes and 10M objects), and provides power savings of 15&percnt;--37&percnt;.", "authors": [{"name": "gae-won you", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81329493110"}, {"name": "seung-won hwang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100581410"}, {"name": "navendu jain", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81758755857"}], "title": "Ursa: Scalable Load and Power Management in Cloud Storage Systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Jo\u00e3o Paiva ", "Country": "oman", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Pedro Ruivo ", "Country": "oman", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Paolo Romano ", "Country": "oman", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lu\u00eds Rodrigues", "Country": "oman", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sukhpal Singh ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Inderveer Chana", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "72\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "502\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "pohang university of science and technology", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "gae-won you"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "pohang university of science and technology", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "seung-won hwang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research redmond", "city": null, "Name": "navendu jain"}]}}, "date": {"month": "March", "year": "2013"}}, "Issue3": {"articles": {"Article No.: 8": {"references": ["Lior Aronovich , Ron Asher , Eitan Bachmat , Haim Bitner , Michael Hirsch , Shmuel T.

Synchronous replication has the advantage of no data loss, but due to latency, synchronous replication is limited by distance and bandwidth. Asynchronous replication on the other hand has no distance limitation, but leads to some data loss which is proportional to the data lag. We present a novel method, implemented within EMC Recover-Point, which allows the system to dynamically move between these replication options without any disruption to the I/O path. As latency grows, the system will move from synchronous replication to semi-synchronous replication and then to snapshot shipping.

A prefetcher seeks to accurately predict which data will be requested and load it ahead of the arrival of the corresponding requests. Current disk prefetch policies in major operating systems track access patterns at the level of file abstraction. While this is useful for exploiting application-level access patterns, for two reasons file-level prefetching cannot realize the full performance improvements achievable by prefetching. First, certain prefetch opportunities can only be detected by knowing the data layout on disk, such as the contiguous layout of file metadata or data from multiple files. Second, nonsequential access of disk data (requiring disk head movement) is much slower than sequential access, and the performance penalty for mis-prefetching a randomly located block, relative to that of a sequential block, is correspondingly greater.To overcome the inherent limitations of prefetching at logical file level, we propose to perform prefetching directly at the level of disk layout, and in a portable way. Our technique, calledDiskSeen, is intended to be supplementary to, and to work synergistically with, any present file-level prefetch policies. DiskSeen tracks the locations and access times of disk blocks and, based on analysis of their temporal and spatial relationships, seeks to improve the sequentiality of disk accesses and overall prefetching performance. It also implements a mechanism to minimize mis-prefetching, on a per-application basis, to mitigate the corresponding performance penalty.Our implementation of the DiskSeen scheme in the Linux 2.6 kernel shows that it can significantly improve the effectiveness of prefetching, reducing execution times by 20&percnt;--60&percnt; for microbenchmarks and real applications such asgrep,CVS, andTPC-H. Even for workloads specifically designed to expose its weaknesses, DiskSeen incurs only minor performance loss.", "authors": [{"name": "song jiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331494953"}, {"name": "xiaoning ding", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330490578"}, {"name": "yuehai xu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81482648485"}, {"name": "kei davis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100601099"}], "title": "A Prefetching Scheme Exploiting both Data Layout and Access History on Disk", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "48\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "284\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "wayne state university", "city": null, "Name": "song jiang"}, {"country": "Jersey", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "new jersey institute of technology", "city": "jersey", "Name": "xiaoning ding"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "wayne state university", "city": null, "Name": "yuehai xu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "los alamos national laboratory", "city": null, "Name": "kei davis"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Biplob Debnath , Sudipta Sengupta , Jin Li, ChunkStash: speeding up inline storage deduplication using flash memory, Proceedings of the 2010 USENIX conference on USENIX annual technical conference, p.16-16, June 23-25, 2010, Boston, MA\n", "Feng Chen , Tian Luo , Xiaodong Zhang, CAFTL: a content-aware flash translation layer enhancing the lifespan of flash memory based solid state drives, Proceedings of the 9th USENIX conference on File and stroage technologies, p.6-6, February 15-17, 2011, San Jose, California\n", "Peter M.

However, emerging nonvolatile memory technologies (sometimes referred to as storage class memory (SCM)), are poised to revolutionize storage systems. The SCM devices can be attached directly to the memory bus and offer fast, fine-grained access to persistent storage.In this article, we propose a new file system---SCMFS, which is specially designed for Storage Class Memory. SCMFS is implemented on the virtual address space and utilizes the existing memory management module of the operating system to help mange the file system space. As a result, we largely simplified the file system operations of SCMFS, which allowed us a better exploration of performance gain from SCM. We have implemented a prototype in Linux and evaluated its performance through multiple benchmarks. The experimental results show that SCMFS outperforms other memory resident file systems, tmpfs, ramfs and ext2 on ramdisk, and achieves about 70&percnt; of memory bandwidth for file read/write operations.", "authors": [{"name": "xiaojian wu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490685697"}, {"name": "sheng qiu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=83458733257"}, {"name": "a l narasimha reddy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452616141"}], "title": "SCMFS: A File System for Storage Class Memory and its Extensions", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "89\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "12\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "486\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "texas am university", "city": null, "Name": "xiaojian wu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "texas am university", "city": null, "Name": "sheng qiu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "texas am university", "city": null, "Name": "a l narasimha reddy"}]}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["Bonwick, J. and Moore, B.

To this end, much effort has been directed to maintaining even performance as the filesystem ages, rather than trying to support a particular narrow benchmark use-case.Linux filesystems are installed on smartphones as well as enterprise servers. This entails challenges on many different fronts.---Scalability. The filesystem must scale in many dimensions: disk space, memory, and CPUs.---Data integrity. Losing data is not an option, and much effort is expended to safeguard the content. This includes checksums, metadata duplication, and RAID support built into the filesystem.---Disk diversity. The system should work well with SSDs and hard disks. It is also expected to be able to use an array of different sized disks, which poses challenges to the RAID and striping mechanisms.This article describes the core ideas, data structures, and algorithms of this filesystem.

A large datacenter facility incurs increased maintenance costs in addition to service unavailability when there are increased failures. Among different server components, hard disk drives are known to contribute significantly to server failures; however, there is very little understanding of the major determinants of disk failures in datacenters. In this work, we focus on the interrelationship between temperature, workload, and hard disk drive failures in a large scale datacenter. We present a dense storage case study from a population housing thousands of servers and tens of thousands of disk drives, hosting a large-scale online service at Microsoft. We specifically establish correlation between temperatures and failures observed at different location granularities: (a) inside drive locations in a server chassis, (b) across server locations in a rack, and (c) across multiple racks in a datacenter. We show that temperature exhibits a stronger correlation to failures than the correlation of disk utilization with drive failures. We establish that variations in temperature are not significant in datacenters and have little impact on failures. We also explore workload impacts on temperature and disk failures and show that the impact of workload is not significant. We then experimentally evaluate knobs that control disk drive temperature, including workload and chassis design knobs. We corroborate our findings from the real data study and show that workload knobs show minimal impact on temperature. Chassis knobs like disk placement and fan speeds have a larger impact on temperature. Finally, we also show the proposed cost benefit of temperature optimizations that increase hard disk drive reliability.", "authors": [{"name": "sriram sankar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81547187856"}, {"name": "mark shaw", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490651072"}, {"name": "kushagra vaid", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453660599"}, {"name": "sudhanva gurumurthi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100302482"}], "title": "Datacenter Scale Evaluation of the Impact of Temperature on Hard Disk Drive Failures", "citations": [{"Name": "Ioannis Manousakis ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "\u00cd\u00f1igo Goiri ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sriram Sankar ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Thu D.

ECS2utilizes data redundancies and deferred writes to conserve energy. In ECS2parity blocks are buffered exclusively in active data nodes whereas parity nodes are placed into low-power mode. (k+r,k) RS-coded ECS2can achieve \u2308(r+ 1)/2\u2309-fault tolerance forkactive data nodes andr-fault tolerance for allk+rnodes. ECS2employs the following three optimizing approaches to improve the energy efficiency of storage clusters. (1) An adaptive threshold policy takes system configurations and I/O workloads into account to maximize standby time periods; (2) a selective activation policy minimizes the number of power-transitions in storage nodes; and (3) a region-based buffer policy speeds up the synchronization process by migrating parity blocks in a batch method. After implementing an ECS2-based prototype in a Linux cluster, we evaluated its energy efficiency and performance using four different types of I/O workloads. The experimental results indicate that compared to energy-oblivious erasure-coded storage, ECS2can save the energy used by storage clusters up to 29.8&percnt; and 28.0&percnt; in read-intensive and write-dominated workloads when k = 6 and r = 3, respectively. The results also show that ECS2accomplishes high power efficiency in both normal and failed cases without noticeably affecting the I/O performance of storage clusters.", "authors": [{"name": "jianzhong huang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548034980"}, {"name": "fenghao zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548034979"}, {"name": "xiao qin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=82459328257"}, {"name": "changsheng xie", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81312484109"}], "title": "Exploiting Redundancies and Deferred Writes to Conserve Energy in Erasure-Coded Storage Clusters", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "32\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "198\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "huazhong university of science and technology", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "jianzhong huang"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "huazhong university of science and technology", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "fenghao zhang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "auburn university", "city": null, "Name": "xiao qin"}, {"country": "sudan", "university": "university of science and technology", "affiliation_string": "huazhong university of science and technology", "city": "umm durman", "Name": "changsheng xie"}]}, "Article No.: 5": {"references": ["Khaled A.

Recently, replication-based approaches were proposed to further reduce the response time. Efficient retrieval of replicated data from multiple disks is a challenging problem. Existing retrieval techniques are designed for storage arrays with identical disks, having no initial load or network delay. In this article, we consider the generalized retrieval problem of replicated data where the disks in the system might be heterogeneous, the disks may have initial load, and the storage arrays might be located on different sites. We first formulate the generalized retrieval problem using a Linear Programming (LP) model and solve it with mixed integer programming techniques. Next, the generalized retrieval problem is formulated as a more efficient maximum flow problem. We prove that the retrieval schedule returned by the maximum flow technique yields the optimal response time and this result matches the LP solution. We also propose a low-complexity online algorithm for the generalized retrieval problem by not guaranteeing the optimality of the result. Performance of proposed and state of the art retrieval strategies are investigated using various replication schemes, query types, query loads, disk specifications, network delays, and initial loads.", "authors": [{"name": "nihat altiparmak", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81508707971"}, {"name": "ali saman tosun", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100503578"}], "title": "Generalized Optimal Response Time Retrieval of Replicated Data from Storage Arrays", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "25\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "180\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Mali", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of texas at san antonio", "city": "san", "Name": "nihat altiparmak"}, {"country": "Mali", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of texas at san antonio", "city": "san", "Name": "ali saman tosun"}]}}, "date": {"month": "July", "year": "2013"}}}, "Volume4": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Article No.: 11": {"references": ["Yossi Azar , Andrei Z.

It exemplifies three design principles:structure(division of servers into a few failure-isolated segments),freedom of choice(freedom to allocate the best servers to store and retrieve data based on current resource availability), andscattered distribution(independent, pseudo-random spread of replicas in the system). These design principles enable storage systems to achieve balanced utilization of storage and network resources in the presence of incremental system expansions, failures of single and shared components, and skewed distributions of data size and popularity. In turn, this ability leads to significantly reduced resource provisioning costs, good user-perceived response times, and fast, parallelized recovery from independent and correlated failures.This article validates Kinesis through theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments on a prototype implementation. Evaluations driven by real-world traces show that Kinesis can significantly outperform the widely used Chain replica-placement strategy in terms of resource requirements, end-to-end delay, and failure recovery.", "authors": [{"name": "john maccormick", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100590181"}, {"name": "nicholas murphy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330495701"}, {"name": "venugopalan ramasubramanian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100394495"}, {"name": "udi wieder", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100333891"}, {"name": "junfeng yang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502714673"}, {"name": "lidong zhou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100264797"}], "title": "Kinesis: A new approach to replica placement in distributed storage systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Mouna Allani ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Beno\u00eet Garbinato ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Amirhossein Malekpour ", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fernando Pedone", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Reliable Communication Infrastructure for Adaptive Data Replication", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Proceedings of the Confederated International Conferences", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "CoopIS", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "DOA", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "IS", "Country": "portugal", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiangyu Luo ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gang Xin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yun Wang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zexi Zhang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hui Wang", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Evangelia A.

To ensure high data reliability and availability, erasure codes with high fault tolerance are required. In this article, we present a new family of erasure codes with high fault tolerance, named GRID codes. They are called such because they are a family ofstrip-based codeswhose strips are arranged into multi-dimensional grids. In the construction of GRID codes, we first introduce a concept ofmatched codesand then discuss how to use matched codes to construct GRID codes. In addition, we propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm for GRID codes. We also discuss some important features of GRID codes. Finally, we compare GRID codes with several categories of existing codes. Our comparisons show that for large-scale storage systems, our GRID codes have attractive advantages over many existing erasure codes: (a) They are completely XOR-based and have very regular structures, ensuring easy implementation; (b) they can provide up to 15 and even higher fault tolerance; and (c) their storage efficiency can reach up to 80&percnt; and even higher. All the advantages make GRID codes more suitable for large-scale storage systems.", "authors": [{"name": "mingqiang li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81381602704"}, {"name": "jiwu shu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100206550"}, {"name": "weimin zheng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81326494227"}], "title": "GRID codes: Strip-based erasure codes with high fault tolerance for storage systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Xianghong Luo ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jiwu Shu", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alexander Thomasian ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yujie Tang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yang Hu", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mingqiang Li ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Patrick P.

When a journaling file system is set up on the FTL, the consistency of the file system is guaranteed by duplications of the same file system changes in both the journal region of the file system and the home locations of the changes. However, these duplications inevitably degrade the performance of the file system. In this article we present an efficient FTL, calledJFTL, based on a journal remapping technique. The FTL uses an address mapping method to write all the data to a new region in a process known as an out-of-place update. Because of this process, the existing data in flash memory is not overwritten by such an update. By using this characteristic of the FTL, the JFTL remaps addresses of the logged file system changes to addresses of the home locations of the changes, instead of writing the changes once more to flash memory. Thus, the JFTL efficiently eliminates redundant data in the flash memory as well as preserving the consistency of the journaling file system. Our experiments confirm that, when associated with a writeback or ordered mode of a conventional EXT3 file system, the JFTL enhances the performance of EXT3 by up to 20&percnt;. Furthermore, when the JFTL operates with a journaled mode of EXT3, there is almost a twofold performance gain in many cases. Moreover, the recovery performance of the JFTL is much better than that of the FTL.", "authors": [{"name": "hyun jin choi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413596624"}, {"name": "seung-ho lim", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81372591425"}, {"name": "kyu ho park", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351598076"}], "title": "JFTL: A flash translation layer based on a journal remapping for flash memory", "citations": [{"Name": "Jaegeuk Kim ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hyotaek Shim ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Seon-Yeong Park ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Seungryoul Maeng ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jin-Soo Kim", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zev Weiss ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sriram Subramanian ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Swaminathan Sundararaman ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nisha Talagala ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andrea C.

Content servers are increasingly limited by disk arm movement, given the rapid growth in disk density, disk transfer rates, server network bandwidth, and content size. Individual file transfers are sequential, but the block access sequence on a content server is effectively random when many slow clients access large files concurrently. Although larger blocks can help improve disk throughput, buffering requirements increase linearly with block size.This article explores a novel block reordering technique that can reduce server disk traffic significantly when large content files are shared. The idea is to transfer blocks to each client in any order that is convenient for the server. The server sends blocks to each client opportunistically in order to maximize the advantage from the disk reads it issues to serve other clients accessing the same file. We first illustrate the motivation and potential impact of aggressive block reordering using simple analytical models. Then we describe a file transfer system using a simple block reordering algorithm, called Circus. Experimental results with the Circus prototype show that it can improve server throughput by a factor of two or more in workloads with strong file access locality.", "authors": [{"name": "stergios v anastasiadis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100555639"}, {"name": "rajiv g wickremesinghe", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100254863"}, {"name": "jeffrey s chase", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100059540"}], "title": "Rethinking FTP: Aggressive block reordering for large file transfers", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "19\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "469\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "greece", "university": "university of ioannina", "affiliation_string": "university of ioannina greece", "city": "ioannina", "Name": "stergios v anastasiadis"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "oracle corporation redwood shores ca", "city": null, "Name": "rajiv g wickremesinghe"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "duke university durham nc", "city": null, "Name": "jeffrey s chase"}]}}, "date": {"month": "January", "year": "2009"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Autoadmin. 2006.

Manual tuning of these database systems by performance experts is increasingly infeasible: For small companies, hiring an expert may be too expensive; for large enterprises, even an expert may not fully understand the interaction between a large system and its multiple changing workloads. This trend has led major vendors to offer tools that automatically and dynamically tune a database system.Many database tuning knobs concern the buffer pool for caching data and disk pages. Specifically, these knobs control the buffer allocation and thus the cache miss probability, which has direct impact on performance.Previous methods for automatic buffer tuning are based on simulation, black-box control, gradient descent, and empirical equations. This article presents a new approach, using calculations with an analytically-derived equation that relates miss probability to buffer allocation; this equation fits four buffer replacement policies, as well as twelve datasets from mainframes running commercial databases in large corporations.The equation identifies a buffer-size limit that is useful for buffer tuning and powering down idle buffers. It can also replace simulation in predicting I/O costs. Experiments with PostgreSQL illustrate how the equation can help optimize online buffer partitioning, ensure fairness in buffer reclamation, and dynamically retune the allocation when workloads change. It is also used, in conjunction with DB2's interface for retrieving miss data, for tuning DB2 buffer allocation to achieve targets for differentiated service.", "authors": [{"name": "dinh nguyen tran", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100265032"}, {"name": "phung chinh huynh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351607156"}, {"name": "y c tay", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100082783"}, {"name": "anthony k h tung", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100486586"}], "title": "A new approach to dynamic self-tuning of database buffers", "citations": [{"Name": "Marc Holze ", "Country": "chile", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Norbert Ritter", "Country": "chile", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "System Models for Goal-Driven Self-management in Autonomic Databases", "Country": "chile", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mostafa Rezazad ", "Country": "thailand", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Y.

We further demonstrate that predictive grouping has untapped dramatic potential to further improve access performance and limit energy consumption. Data retrieval latencies are considered a major bottleneck, and with growing volumes of data and increased storage needs it is only growing in significance. Data storage infrastructure is therefore a growing consumer of energy at data-center scales, while the individual disk is already a significant concern for mobile computing (accounting for almost a third of a mobile system's energy demands). While improving responsiveness of storage subsystems and hence reducing latencies in data retrieval is often considered contradictory with efforts to reduce disk energy consumption, we demonstrate that predictive data grouping has the potential to simultaneously work towards both these goals. Predictive data grouping has advantages in its applicability compared to both prior approaches to reducing latencies and to reducing energy usage. For latencies, grouping can be performed opportunistically, thereby avoiding the serious performance penalties that can be incurred with prior applications of access prediction (such as predictive prefetching of data). For energy, we show how predictive grouping can even save energy use for an individual disk that is never idle.Predictive data grouping with effective replication results in a reduction of the overall mechanical movement required to retrieve data. We have built upon our detailed measurements of disk power consumption, and have estimated both the energy expended by a hard disk for its mechanical components, and that needed to move the disk arm. We have further compared, via simulation, three models of predictive grouping of on-disk data, including an optimal arrangement of data that is guaranteed to minimize disk arm movement. These experiments have allowed us to measure the limits of performance improvement achievable with optimal data grouping and replication strategies on a single device, and have further allowed us to demonstrate the potential of such schemes to reduce energy consumption of mechanical components by up to 70&percnt;.", "authors": [{"name": "david essary", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351607291"}, {"name": "ahmed amer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100072217"}], "title": "Predictive data grouping: Defining the bounds of energy and latency reduction through predictive data grouping and replication", "citations": [{"Name": "Alma Riska ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ningfang Mi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Evgenia Smirni ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Giuliano Casale", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Stephanie N.

We propose an efficient intradisk redundancy scheme to enhance the reliability of RAID systems. This scheme introduces an additional level of redundancy inside each disk, on top of the RAID redundancy across multiple disks. The RAID parity provides protection against disk failures, whereas the proposed scheme aims to protect against media-related unrecoverable errors. In particular, we consider an intradisk redundancy architecture that is based on an interleaved parity-check coding scheme, which incurs only negligible I/O performance degradation. A comparison between this coding scheme and schemes based on traditional Reed--Solomon codes and single-parity-check codes is conducted by analytical means. A new model is developed to capture the effect of correlated unrecoverable sector errors. The probability of an unrecoverable failure associated with these schemes is derived for the new correlated model, as well as for the simpler independent error model. We also derive closed-form expressions for the mean time to data loss of RAID-5 and RAID-6 systems in the presence of unrecoverable errors and disk failures. We then combine these results to characterize the reliability of RAID systems that incorporate the intradisk redundancy scheme. Our results show that in the practical case of correlated errors, the interleaved parity-check scheme provides the same reliability as the optimum, albeit more complex, Reed--Solomon coding scheme. Finally, the I/O and throughput performances are evaluated by means of analysis and event-driven simulation.", "authors": [{"name": "ajay dholakia", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100183548"}, {"name": "evangelos eleftheriou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100250134"}, {"name": "xiao-yu hu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351596310"}, {"name": "ilias iliadis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100203289"}, {"name": "jai menon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100196721"}, {"name": "kk rao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100591175"}], "title": "A new intra-disk redundancy scheme for high-reliability RAID storage systems in the presence of unrecoverable errors", "citations": [{"Name": "Ilias Iliadis ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Vinodh Venkatesan", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Guanying Wang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ali R.

In order to develop suitable protection mechanisms against data corruption, it is essential to understand its characteristics. In this article, we present the first large-scale study of data corruption. We analyze corruption instances recorded in production storage systems containing a total of 1.53 million disk drives, over a period of 41 months. We study three classes of corruption: checksum mismatches, identity discrepancies, and parity inconsistencies. We focus on checksum mismatches since they occur the most.We find more than 400,000 instances of checksum mismatches over the 41-month period. We find many interesting trends among these instances, including: (i) nearline disks (and their adapters) develop checksum mismatches an order of magnitude more often than enterprise-class disk drives, (ii) checksum mismatches within the same disk are not independent events and they show high spatial and temporal locality, and (iii) checksum mismatches across different disks in the same storage system are not independent.

Storage uses a significant fraction of the power budget and there are no widely deployed power-saving solutions for enterprise storage systems. The traditional view is that enterprise workloads make spinning disks down ineffective because idle periods are too short. We analyzed block-level traces from 36 volumes in an enterprise data center for one week and concluded that significant idle periods exist, and that they can be further increased by modifying the read/write patterns usingwrite off-loading. Write off-loading allows write requests on spun-down disks to be temporarily redirected to persistent storage elsewhere in the data center.The key challenge is doing this transparently and efficiently at the block level, without sacrificing consistency or failure resilience. We describe our write off-loading design and implementation that achieves these goals. We evaluate it by replaying portions of our traces on a rack-based testbed. Results show that just spinning disks down when idle saves 28--36&percnt; of energy, and write off-loading further increases the savings to 45--60&percnt;.", "authors": [{"name": "dushyanth narayanan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314484530"}, {"name": "austin donnelly", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100337107"}, {"name": "antony rowstron", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100494624"}], "title": "Write off-loading: Practical power management for enterprise storage", "citations": [{"Name": "Chundong Wang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Weng-Fai Wong", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yan Shen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Liming Luo ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Guangyan Zhang", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shobana Balakrishnan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Richard Black ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Austin Donnelly ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Paul England ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Adam Glass ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dave Harper ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sergey Legtchenko ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Aaron Ogus ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Eric Peterson ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Antony Rowstron", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Nishanth Sastry ", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jon Crowcroft", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Thomas Knauth ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Christof Fetzer", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "dsync: efficient block-wise synchronization of multi-gigabyte binary data", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Proceedings of the 27th international conference on Large Installation System Administration", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "p.45-58", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "November 03-08", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "2013", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Washington", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "D.

Understanding storage failure characteristics is crucially important for designing and building a reliable storage system. While several recent studies have been conducted on understanding storage failures, almost all of them focus on the failure characteristics of one component\u2014disks\u2014and do not study other storage component failures.This article analyzes the failure characteristics of storage subsystems. More specifically, we analyzed the storage logs collected from about 39,000 storage systems commercially deployed at various customer sites. The dataset covers a period of 44 months and includes about 1,800,000 disks hosted in about 155,000 storage-shelf enclosures. Our study reveals many interesting findings, providing useful guidelines for designing reliable storage systems. Some of our major findings include: (1) In addition to disk failures that contribute to 20--55&percnt; of storage subsystem failures, other components such as physical interconnects and protocol stacks also account for a significant percentage of storage subsystem failures. (2) Each individual storage subsystem failure type, and storage subsystem failure as a whole, exhibits strong self-correlations. In addition, these failures exhibit \u201cbursty\u201d patterns. (3) Storage subsystems configured with redundant interconnects experience 30--40&percnt; lower failure rates than those with a single interconnect. (4) Spanning disks of a RAID group across multiple shelves provides a more resilient solution for storage subsystems than within a single shelf.", "authors": [{"name": "weihang jiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81336490049"}, {"name": "chongfeng hu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351590905"}, {"name": "yuanyuan zhou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451594551"}, {"name": "arkady kanevsky", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81546206956"}], "title": "Are disks the dominant contributor for storage failures?: A comprehensive study of storage subsystem failure characteristics", "citations": [{"Name": "Ying Zhao ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiang Liu ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Siqing Gan ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Weimin Zheng", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Predicting disk failures with HMM- and HSMM-based approaches", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Asaf Cidon ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Robert Escriva ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sachin Katti ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mendel Rosenblum ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Emin G\u00fcn Sirer", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Rahul Potharaju ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Navendu Jain", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "33\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "580\n", "Citation Count": "8\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of illinois at urbana champaign urbana il", "city": null, "Name": "weihang jiang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of illinois at urbana champaign urbana il", "city": null, "Name": "chongfeng hu"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of illinois at urbana champaign urbana il", "city": null, "Name": "yuanyuan zhou"}]}, "Article No.: 6": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/1416944.1416945", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "mary baker", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81385597166"}], "title": "Introduction to special issue of USENIX FAST 2008", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "8\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "201\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": []}, "Article No.: 9": {"references": ["Ashish Aggarwal , Pankaj Jalote, Monitoring the Security Health of Software Systems, Proceedings of the 17th International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering, p.146-158, November 07-10, 2006[doi>10.1109/ISSRE.2006.32]\n", "Ken Ashcraft , Dawson Engler, Using Programmer-Written Compiler Extensions to Catch Security Holes, Proceedings of the 2002 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, p.143, May 12-15, 2002\n", "Bishop, M. 1995.

Existing solutions either help users to detect these problems (by pinpointing their locations in the code), or prevent the problem altogether (by modifying the kernel or its API). But the latter alternative is not prevalent, and the former is just the first step: Programmers must still address TOCTTOU flaws within the limits of the existing API with which several important tasks cannot be accomplished in a portable straightforward manner. Recently, Dean and Hu [2004] addressed this problem and suggested a probabilistic hardness amplification approach that alleviated the matter. Alas, shortly after, Borisov et al. [2005] responded with an attack termed \u201cfilesystem maze\u201d that defeated the new approach.We begin by noting that mazes constitute a generic way to deterministically win many TOCTTOU races (gone are the days when the probability was small). In the face of this threat, we: (1) develop a new user-level defense that can withstand mazes; and (2) show that our method is undefeated even by much stronger hypothetical attacks that provide the adversary program with ideal conditions to win the race (enjoying complete and instantaneous knowledge about the defending program's actions and being able to perfectly synchronize accordingly). The fact that our approach is immune to these unrealistic attacks suggests it can be used as a simple and portable solution to a large class of TOCTTOU vulnerabilities, without requiring modifications to the underlying operating system.", "authors": [{"name": "dan tsafrir", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81337494165"}, {"name": "tomer hertz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100478711"}, {"name": "david wagner", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81406593711"}, {"name": "dilma da silva", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81313482823"}], "title": "Portably solving file races with hardness amplification", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "18\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "257\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm tj watson research center yorktown heights ny", "city": null, "Name": "dan tsafrir"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft research redmond wa", "city": null, "Name": "tomer hertz"}, {"country": "Trinidad and Tobago", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of california berkeley ca", "city": "california", "Name": "david wagner"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "ibm tj watson research center yorktown heights ny", "city": null, "Name": "dilma da silva"}]}}, "date": {"month": "November", "year": "2008"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Coulson, R., Trika, S., Matthews, J., and Farber, R. 2006.

Complex interactions between I/O devices, caches, kernel daemons, and other OS components result in behavior that is rather difficult to analyze. Moreover, systems have different features and optimizations, so no single benchmark is always suitable. The large variety of workloads that these systems experience in the real world also adds to this difficulty.In this article we survey 415 file system and storage benchmarks from 106 recent papers. We found that most popular benchmarks are flawed and many research papers do not provide a clear indication of true performance. We provide guidelines that we hope will improve future performance evaluations. To show how some widely used benchmarks can conceal or overemphasize overheads, we conducted a set of experiments. As a specific example, slowing down read operations on ext2 by a factor of 32 resulted in only a 2--5&percnt; wall-clock slowdown in a popular compile benchmark. Finally, we discuss future work to improve file system and storage benchmarking.", "authors": [{"name": "avishay traeger", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310482552"}, {"name": "erez zadok", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100256303"}, {"name": "nikolai joukov", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309494307"}, {"name": "charles p wright", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330500224"}], "title": "A nine year study of file system and storage benchmarking", "citations": [{"Name": "Chundong Wang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Weng-Fai Wong", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yu Hua ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hong Jiang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yifeng Zhu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dan Feng ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lei Tian", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Vasily Tarasov ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Saumitra Bhanage ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Erez Zadok ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Margo Seltzer", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zhenhan Liu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiaoxuan Meng ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lu Xu", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lock management in blue whale file system", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ming-Chang Yang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yuan-Hao Chang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tei-Wei Kuo", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Niloy Mukherjee ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Amit Ganesh ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Vinayagam Djegaradjane ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sujatha Muthulingam ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wei Zhang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Krishna Kunchithapadam ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Scott Lynn ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bharath Aleti ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kam Shergill ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Shaoyu Wang", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "John A.

Unfortunately, rather than benchmarking with realistic file-system images, most system designers and evaluators rely onad hocassumptions and (often inaccurate) rules of thumb. Furthermore, the lack of standardization and reproducibility makes file-system benchmarking ineffective. To remedy these problems, we develop Impressions, a framework to generate statistically accurate file-system images with realistic metadata and content. Impressions is flexible, supporting user-specified constraints on various file-system parameters using a number of statistical techniques to generate consistent images. In this article, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of Impressions and demonstrate its utility using desktop search as a case study. We believe Impressions will prove to be useful to system developers and users alike.", "authors": [{"name": "nitin agrawal", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310492162"}, {"name": "andrea c arpaci-dusseau", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100272384"}, {"name": "remzi h arpaci-dusseau", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100272389"}], "title": "Generating realisticimpressionsfor file-system benchmarking", "citations": [{"Name": "H.

In science, medicine, commerce, and government, data provenance tracking is essential for rights protection, regulatory compliance, management of intelligence and medical data, and authentication of information as it flows through workplace tasks. While significant research has been conducted in this area, the associated security and privacy issues have not been explored, leaving provenance information vulnerable to illicit alteration as it passes through untrusted environments.In this article, we show how to provide strong integrity and confidentiality assurances for data provenance information at the kernel, file system, or application layer. We describe Sprov, our provenance-aware system prototype that implements provenance tracking of data writes at the application layer, which makes Sprov extremely easy to deploy. We present empirical results that show that, for real-life workloads, the runtime overhead of Sprov for recording provenance with confidentiality and integrity guarantees ranges from 1&percnt; to 13&percnt;, when all file modifications are recorded, and from 12&percnt; to 16&percnt;, when all file read and modifications are tracked.", "authors": [{"name": "ragib hasan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309486670"}, {"name": "radu sion", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100430518"}, {"name": "marianne winslett", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100471278"}], "title": "Preventing history forgery with secure provenance", "citations": [{"Name": "Amril Syalim ", "Country": "indonesia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Takashi Nishide ", "Country": "indonesia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kouichi Sakurai", "Country": "indonesia", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mohamed Amin Sakka ", "Country": "norway", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Bruno Defude ", "Country": "norway", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jorge Tellez", "Country": "norway", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Document provenance in the cloud: constraints and challenges", "Country": "norway", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Umut A.

However, using versions to recover from data-corrupting events requires a human to determine precisely which files and versions to restore. We can create more meaningful versions and enhance the value of those versions by capturing the causal connections among files, facilitating selection and recovery of precisely the right versions after data corrupting events.We determine when to create new versions of files automatically using the causal relationships among files. The literature on versioning file systems usually examines two extremes of possible version-creation algorithms: open-to-close versioning and versioning on every write. We evaluate causal versions of these two algorithms and introduce two additional causality-based algorithms: Cycle-Avoidance and Graph-Finesse.We show that capturing and maintaining causal relationships imposes less than 7&percnt; overhead on a versioning system, providing benefit at low cost. We then show that Cycle-Avoidance provides more meaningful versions of files created during concurrent program execution, with overhead comparable to open/close versioning. Graph-Finesse provides even greater control, frequently at comparable overhead, but sometimes at unacceptable overhead. Versioning on every write is an interesting extreme case, but is far too costly to be useful in practice.", "authors": [{"name": "kiran-kumar muniswamy-reddy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81310489936"}, {"name": "david a holland", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100092073"}], "title": "Causality-based versioning", "citations": [{"Name": "Devin J.

We then propose a different approach to secure logging based upon recently developed Forward-Secure Sequential Aggregate (FssAgg) authentication techniques. Our approach offers both space-efficiency and provable security. We illustrate two concrete schemes\u2014one private-verifiable and one public-verifiable\u2014that offer practical secure logging without any reliance on online trusted third parties or secure hardware. We also investigate the concept of immutability in the context of forward-secure sequential aggregate authentication to provide finer grained verification.

Due to these versatile features, MEMS storage is anticipated to be used for a wide range of applications from storage for small handheld devices to high capacity mass storage servers. However, MEMS storage has vastly different physical characteristics compared to a traditional disk. First, MEMS storage has thousands of heads that can be activated simultaneously. Second, the media of MEMS storage is a square structure which is different from the platter structure of disks. This article presents a new request scheduling algorithm for MEMS storage called P-SPTF that makes use of the aforementioned characteristics. P-SPTF considers the parallelism of MEMS storage as well as the seek time of requests on the two dimensional square structure. We then present another algorithm called PA-SPTF that considers the aging factor so that starvation resistance is improved. Simulation studies show that PA-SPTF improves the performance of MEMS storage by up to 39.2&percnt; in terms of the average response time and 62.4&percnt; in terms of starvation resistance compared to the widely acknowledged SPTF algorithm. We also show that there exists a spectrum of scheduling algorithms that subsumes both the P-SPTF and PA-SPTF algorithms.", "authors": [{"name": "hyokyung bahn", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100385889"}, {"name": "soyoon lee", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81317496658"}, {"name": "sam h noh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350592925"}], "title": "P/PA-SPTF: Parallelism-aware request scheduling algorithms for MEMS-based storage devices", "citations": [{"Name": "Mohammed G.

Many schemes were proposed for single copy declustering of spatial data. Recently, declustering using replication gained a lot of interest and several schemes with different properties were proposed. It is computationally expensive to verify optimality of replication schemes designed for range queries and existing schemes verify optimality for up to 50 disks. In this article, we propose a novel method to find replicated declustering schemes that render all spatial range queries optimal. The proposed scheme uses threshold based declustering, divisibility of large queries for optimization and optimistic approach to compute maximum flow. The proposed scheme is generic and works for any number of dimensions. Experimental results show that using 3 copies there exist allocations that render all spatial range queries optimal for up to 750 disks in 2 dimensions and with the exception of several values for up to 100 disks in 3 dimensions. The proposed scheme improves search for strictly optimal replicated declustering schemes significantly and will be a valuable tool to answer open problems on replicated declustering.", "authors": [{"name": "ali saman tosun", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100503578"}], "title": "Divide-and-conquer scheme for strictly optimal retrieval of range queries", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "13\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "236\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Mali", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of texas at san antonio", "city": "san", "Name": "ali saman tosun"}]}, "Article No.: 10": {"references": ["Almeda, V., Cesario, M., Fonseca, R., Meira, W.

A basic workload characteristic assumption of most existing solutions to the problem is that there exists a strong inverse correlation between file access frequency and file size. In other words, the most popular files are typically small in size, while the large files are relatively unpopular. Recent studies on the characteristics of Web proxy traces suggested, however, the correlation, if any, is so weak that it can be ignored. Hence, the following two questions arise naturally. First, can existing algorithms still perform well when the workload assumption does not hold&quest; Second, if not, can one develop a new file assignment strategy that is immune to the workload assumption&quest; To answer these questions, we first evaluate the performance of three well-known file assignment algorithms with and without the workload assumption, respectively. Next, we develop a novel static nonpartitioned file assignment strategy for parallel I/O systems, called static round-robin (SOR), which is immune to the workload assumption. Comprehensive experimental results show that SOR consistently improves the performance in terms of mean response time over the existing schemes.", "authors": [{"name": "tao xie", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314487030"}, {"name": "yao sun", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81467656574"}], "title": "A file assignment strategy independent of workload characteristic assumptions", "citations": [{"Name": "Bin Dong ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Surendra Byna ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kesheng Wu", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sai-Qin Long ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yue-Long Zhao ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Wei Chen", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "MORM: A Multi-objective Optimized Replication Management strategy for cloud storage cluster", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "24\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "393\n", "Citation Count": "6\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Mali", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "san diego state university san diego ca", "city": "san", "Name": "tao xie"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Guillermo A.

RAID5 dedicates one out ofNdisks to parity to mask single disk failures, that is, the contents of a block on a failed disk can be reconstructed by exclusive-ORing the corresponding blocks on surviving disks. RAID5 can mask a single disk failure, and it is vulnerable to data loss if a second disk failure occurs. The RAID5 rebuild process systematically reconstructs the contents of a failed disk on a spare disk, returning the system to its original state, but the rebuild process may be unsuccessful due to unreadable sectors. This has led totwo disk failure tolerant arrays (2DFTs), such as RAID6 based on Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. EVENODD, RDP (Row-Diagonal-Parity), the X-code, and RM2 (Row-Matrix) are 2DFTs with parity coding. RM2 incurs a higher level of redundancy than two disks, while the X-code is limited to a prime number of disks. RDP is optimal with respect to the number of XOR operations at the encoding, but not for short write operations. For small symbol sizes EVENODD and RDP have the same disk access pattern as RAID6, while RM2 and the X-code incur a high recovery cost with two failed disks. We describe variations to RAID5 and RAID6 organizations, including clustered RAID, different methods to update parities, rebuild processing, disk scrubbing to eliminate sector errors, and theintra-disk redundancy (IDR)method to deal with sector errors. We summarize the results of recent studies of failures in hard disk drives. We describe Markov chain reliability models to estimate RAIDmean time to data loss (MTTDL)taking into account sector errors and the effect of disk scrubbing. Numerical results show that RAID5 plus IDR attains the same MTTDL level as RAID6, while incurring a lower performance penalty. We conclude with a survey of analytic and simulation studies of RAID performance and tools and benchmarks for RAID performance evaluation.", "authors": [{"name": "alexander thomasian", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100250963"}, {"name": "mario blaum", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100102492"}], "title": "Higher reliability redundant disk arrays: Organization, operation, and coding", "citations": [{"Name": "Du Yimo ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Liu Fang ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chen Zhiguang ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ma Xin", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ilias Iliadis ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Vinodh Venkatesan", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jon G.

However, previous CPU- or memory-centric load balancing schemes suffer significant performance drop under I/O-intensive workloads due to the imbalance of I/O load. To solve this problem, we propose two simple yet effective I/O-aware load-balancing schemes for two types of clusters: (1) homogeneous clusters where nodes are identical and (2) heterogeneous clusters, which are comprised of a variety of nodes with different performance characteristics in computing power, memory capacity, and disk speed. In addition to assigning I/O-intensive sequential and parallel jobs to nodes with light I/O loads, the proposed schemes judiciously take into account both CPU and memory load sharing in the system. Therefore, our schemes are able to maintain high performance for a wide spectrum of workloads. We develop analytic models to study mean slowdowns, task arrival, and transfer processes in system levels. Using a set of real I/O-intensive parallel applications and synthetic parallel jobs with various I/O characteristics, we show that our proposed schemes consistently improve the performance over existing non-I/O-aware load-balancing schemes, including CPU- and Memory-aware schemes and a PBS-like batch scheduler for parallel and sequential jobs, for a diverse set of workload conditions. Importantly, this performance improvement becomes much more pronounced when the applications are I/O-intensive. For example, the proposed approaches deliver 23.6--88.0 &percnt; performance improvements for I/O-intensive applications such as LU decomposition, Sparse Cholesky, Titan, Parallel text searching, and Data Mining. When I/O load is low or well balanced, the proposed schemes are capable of maintaining the same level of performance as the existing non-I/O-aware schemes.", "authors": [{"name": "xiao qin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81423594868"}, {"name": "hong jiang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81361606829"}, {"name": "adam manzanares", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350582642"}, {"name": "xiaojun ruan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350569753"}, {"name": "shu yin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81440613330"}], "title": "Dynamic load balancing for I/O-intensive applications on clusters", "citations": [{"Name": "Takeshi Yamamuro ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yoshiharu Suga ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Naoya Kotani ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Toshio Hitaka ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Masashi Yamamuro", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Buffer cache de-duplication for query dispatch in replicated databases", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Neeraj Rathore ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Inderveer Chana", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Load Balancing and Job Migration Techniques in Grid: A Survey of Recent Trends", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "27\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "705\n", "Citation Count": "6\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "auburn university al", "city": null, "Name": "xiao qin"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of nebraska lincoln", "city": null, "Name": "hong jiang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "auburn university al", "city": null, "Name": "adam manzanares"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "auburn university al", "city": null, "Name": "xiaojun ruan"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "auburn university al", "city": null, "Name": "shu yin"}]}}, "date": {"month": "November", "year": "2009"}}, "Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 6": {"references": ["Serge Abiteboul , Rakesh Agrawal , Phil Bernstein , Mike Carey , Stefano Ceri , Bruce Croft , David DeWitt , Mike Franklin , Hector Garcia Molina , Dieter Gawlick , Jim Gray , Laura Haas , Alon Halevy , Joe Hellerstein , Yannis Ioannidis , Martin Kersten , Michael Pazzani , Mike Lesk , David Maier , Jeff Naughton , Hans Schek , Timos Sellis , Avi Silberschatz , Mike Stonebraker , Rick Snodgrass , Jeff Ullman , Gerhard Weikum , Jennifer Widom , Stan Zdonik, The Lowell database research self-assessment, Communications of the ACM, v.48 n.5, p.111-118, May 2005[doi>10.1145/1060710.1060718]\n", "Loredana Afanasiev , Ioana Manolescu , Philippe Michiels, MemBeR: a micro-benchmark repository for XQuery, Proceedings of the Third international conference on Database and XML Technologies, August 28-29, 2005, Trondheim, Norway[doi>10.1007/11547273_11]\n", "Afanasiev, L. and Marx, M. 2006.

Current approaches for storing semi-structured data use existing storage machinery; they either map the data to relational databases, or use a combination of flat files and indexes. While employing these existing storage mechanisms provides readily available solutions, there is a need to more closely examine their suitability to this class of data. Particularly, retrofitting existing solutions for semi-structured data can result in a mismatch between the tree structure of the data and the access characteristics of the underlying storage device (disk drive). This study explores various possibilities in the design space of native storage solutions for semi-structured data by exploring alternative approaches that match application data access characteristics to those of the underlying disk drive. For evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed native techniques in relation to the existing solution, we experiment with XML data using the XPathMark benchmark. Extensive evaluation reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed native data layout techniques. While the existing solutions work really well fordeep-focusedqueries into a semi-structured document (those that result in retrieving entire subtrees), the proposed native solutions substantially outperform for thenon-deep-focusedqueries, which we demonstrate are at least as important as the deep-focused.

Under such conditions, idleness becomes a valuable \u201cresource\u201d that needs to be efficiently managed. A common approach in system design is to be nonwork conserving by \u201cidle waiting\u201d, that is, delay the scheduling of background jobs to avoid slowing down upcoming foreground tasks.In this article, we complement \u201cidle waiting\u201d with the \u201cestimation\u201d of background work to be served in every idle interval to effectively manage the trade-off between the performance of foreground and background tasks. As a result, the storage system is better utilized without compromising foreground performance. Our analysis shows that if idle times have low variability, then idle waiting is not necessary. Only if idle times are highly variable does idle waiting become necessary to minimize the impact of background activity on foreground performance. We further show that if there is burstiness in idle intervals, then it is possible to predict accurately the length of incoming idle intervals and use this information to serve more background jobs without affecting foreground performance.", "authors": [{"name": "ningfang mi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319497634"}, {"name": "alma riska", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100466124"}, {"name": "qi zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384608165"}, {"name": "evgenia smirni", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100120677"}, {"name": "erik riedel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100553023"}], "title": "Efficient management of idleness in storage systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Fengfeng Pan ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yinliang Yue ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jin Xiong", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Feng Yan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Alma Riska ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Evgenia Smirni", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hyogi Sim ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Youngjae Kim ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sudharshan S.

Unfortunately, many of the security mechanisms that modern systems rely upon, such as encryption, are poorly suited for storing data for indefinitely long periods of time; it is very difficult to manage keys and update cryptosystems to provide secrecy through encryption over periods of decades. Worse, an adversary who can compromise an archive need only wait for cryptanalysis techniques to catch up to the encryption algorithm used at the time of the compromise in order to obtain \u201csecure\u201d data. To address these concerns, we have developed POTSHARDS, an archival storage system that provides long-term security for data with very long lifetimes without using encryption. Secrecy is achieved by using unconditionally secure secret splitting and spreading the resulting shares across separately managed archives. Providing availability and data recovery in such a system can be difficult; thus, we use a new technique, approximate pointers, in conjunction with secure distributed RAID techniques to provide availability and reliability across independent archives.

Although an increasing number of secure storage systems have been developed, there is no way to dynamically choose security services to meet disk requests' flexible security requirements. Furthermore, existing security techniques for disk systems are not suitable to guarantee desired response times of disk requests. We remedy this situation by proposing an adaptive strategy (referred to as AWARDS) that can judiciously select the most appropriate security service for each write request, while endeavoring to guarantee the desired response times of all disk requests. To prove the efficiency of the proposed approach, we build an analytical model to measure the probability that a disk request is completed before its desired response time. The model also can be used to derive the expected value of disk requests' security levels. Empirical results based on synthetic workloads as well as real I/O-intensive applications show that AWARDS significantly improves overall performance over an existing scheme by up to 358.9&percnt; (with an average of 213.4&percnt;).", "authors": [{"name": "mais nijim", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100151440"}, {"name": "xiao qin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81423594868"}, {"name": "tao xie", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314487030"}], "title": "Modeling and improving security of a local disk system for write-intensive workloads", "citations": [{"Name": "Mais Nijim ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiao Qin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Muhittin Yilmaz", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiaojun Ruan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Adam Manzanares ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kiranmai Bellam ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiao Qin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ziliang Zong", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "9\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "527\n", "Citation Count": "5\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Mexico", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "new mexico institute of mining and technology socorro nm", "city": "mexico", "Name": "mais nijim"}, {"country": "Mexico", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "new mexico institute of mining and technology socorro nm", "city": "mexico", "Name": "xiao qin"}, {"country": "Mali", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "san diego state university san diego ca", "city": "san", "Name": "tao xie"}]}, "Pages: 371-399": {"references": ["3PARdata. 2003.

In this article we present two external memory index structures for the efficient retrieval of records stored on the local flash memory of a WSD. Our index structures,MicroHashandMicroGF (micro grid files), exploit the asymmetric read/write and wear characteristics of flash memory in order to offer high-performance indexing and searching capabilities in the presence of a low-energy budget, which is typical for the devices under discussion. Both structures organize data and index pages on the flash media using a sorted by timestamp file organization. A key idea behind these index structures is that expensive random access deletions are completely eliminated. MicroHash enables equality searches by value in constant time and equality searches by timestamp in logarithmic time at a small cost of storing index pages on the flash media. Similarly, MicroGF enables spatial equality and proximity searches in constant time. We have implemented these index structures in nesC, the programming language of the TinyOS operating system. Our trace-driven experimentation with several real datasets reveals that our index structures offer excellent search performance at a small cost of constructing and maintaining the index.", "authors": [{"name": "song lin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100221381"}, {"name": "demetrios zeinalipour-yazti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81315492866"}, {"name": "vana kalogeraki", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100608150"}, {"name": "dimitrios gunopulos", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100515024"}, {"name": "walid a najjar", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100519759"}], "title": "Efficient indexing data structures for flash-based sensor devices", "citations": [{"Name": "Li-Pin Chang ", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chen-Hui Hsu", "Country": "japan", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Baobing Wang ", "Country": "belgium", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "John S.

One way to achieve this goal is to avoid maintaining duplicate copies of the same data. Eliminating redundant data at the source by not writing data which has already been stored not only reduces storage overheads, but can also improve bandwidth utilization. For these reasons, in the face of today's exponentially growing data volumes, redundant data elimination techniques have assumed critical significance in the design of modern storage systems.Intelligent object partitioning techniques identify data that isnewwhen objects are updated, and transfer only these chunks to a storage server. In this article, we propose a new object partitioning technique, calledfingerdiff, that improves upon existing schemes in several important respects. Most notably,fingerdiffdynamically chooses a partitioning strategy for a data object based on its similarities with previously stored objects in order to improve storage and bandwidth utilization. We present a detailed evaluation offingerdiff, and other existing object partitioning schemes, using a set of real-world workloads. We show that for these workloads, the duplicate elimination strategies employed byfingerdiffimprove storage utilization on average by 25&percnt;, and bandwidth utilization on average by 40&percnt; over comparable techniques.", "authors": [{"name": "deepak r bobbarjung", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350601490"}, {"name": "suresh jagannathan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100208907"}, {"name": "cezary dubnicki", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100022312"}], "title": "Improving duplicate elimination in storage systems", "citations": [{"Name": "Lav R.

How to provide efficient roll back and quick mounting for flash-memory file systems has become an important research topic in recent years, in addition to the work on effective garbage collection and superb runtime performance. Such an observation motivates our work on the investigation of efficient initialization and crash recovery of flash-memory file systems based on log structures. A methodology is proposed for the acceleration of mounting and crash recovery for log-based file systems. A system prototype based on a well-known flash-memory file system, YAFFS, was implemented with performance evaluation. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology can reduce mounting time significantly, regardless of whether the file system is properly unmounted.", "authors": [{"name": "chin-hsien wu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100663203"}, {"name": "tei-wei kuo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452594769"}, {"name": "li-pin chang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350599676"}], "title": "The Design of efficient initialization and crash recovery for log-based file systems over flash memory", "citations": [{"Name": "Peter G.

Users, however, prefer to see all files in one location for convenience. One solution that accommodates both needs is virtual namespace unification---providing a merged view of several directories without physically merging them. For example, namespace unification can merge the contents of several CD-ROM images without unpacking them, merge binary directories from different packages, merge views from several file servers, and more. Namespace unification can also enable snapshotting by marking some data sources read-only and then utilizing copy-on-write for the read-only sources. For example, an OS image may be contained on a read-only CD-ROM image---and the user's configuration, data, and programs could be stored in a separate read-write directory. With copy-on-write unification, the user need not be concerned about the two disparate file systems.It is difficult to maintain Unix semantics while offering a versatile namespace unification system. Past efforts to provide such unification often compromised on the set of features provided or Unix compatibility---resulting in an incomplete solution that users could not use.We designed and implemented a versatile namespace unification system calledUnionfs. Unionfs maintains Unix semantics while offering advanced namespace unification features: dynamic insertion and removal of namespaces at any point in the merged view, mixing read-only and read-write components, efficient in-kernel duplicate elimination, NFS interoperability, and more. Since releasing our Linux implementation, it has been used by thousands of users and over a dozen Linux distributions, which helped us discover and solve many practical problems.", "authors": [{"name": "charles p wright", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330500224"}, {"name": "jay dave", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314488495"}, {"name": "puja gupta", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314488617"}, {"name": "harikesavan krishnan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314490129"}, {"name": "david p quigley", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314491336"}, {"name": "erez zadok", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100256303"}, {"name": "mohammad nayyer zubair", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81336494502"}], "title": "Versatility and Unix semantics in namespace unification", "citations": [{"Name": "Michael J.

One of the most fundamental factors impacting disk drive design is heat dissipation, since it directly affects drive reliability. Until now, drive manufacturers have continued to meet the 40&percnt; annual growth target of the internal data-rates (IDR) by increasing RPMs and shrinking platter sizes, both of which have counteracting effects on the heat dissipation within a drive. In this article, we shall show that we are getting to a point where it is going to be very difficult to stay on this roadmap. We first present detailed models that capture the close relationships between capacity, performance, and thermal characteristics over time. Using these models, we quantify the drop-off in IDR growth rates over the next decade if we are to adhere to the thermal design envelope. We motivate the need for continued improvements in IDR by showing that the response times of real workloads can be improved by 30--60&percnt; with a 10K increase in the RPM for disks used in their respective storage systems. We then present two dynamic thermal management (DTM) techniques that can be used to buy back some of this IDR loss. The first DTM technique exploits the thermal slack between what the drive was intended to support and the currently lower operating temperature to ramp up the RPM. The second DTM technique assumes that the drive is only designed for average case operation and dynamically throttles its activities to remain within the thermal envelope.", "authors": [{"name": "sudhanva gurumurthi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100302482"}, {"name": "anand sivasubramaniam", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100205544"}], "title": "Thermal issues in disk drive design: Challenges and possible solutions", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "18\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "827\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Honduras", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of virginia charlottesville va", "city": "virginia", "Name": "sudhanva gurumurthi"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the pennsylvania state university university park pa", "city": null, "Name": "anand sivasubramaniam"}]}, "Pages: 1-21": {"references": ["Ari, I., Amer, A., Gramacy, R., Miller, E.

However, MEMS-based storage provides a limited amount of storage per device and is likely to be more expensive than magnetic disk. Systems designers will therefore need to make trade-offs to achieve well-balanced designs. We present an architecture in which MEMS devices are organized into MEMS storage enclosures with online spares. Such enclosures are proven to be highly reliable storage building bricks with no maintenance during their economic lifetimes. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of using MEMS as another layer in the storage hierarchy, bridging the cost and performance gap between MEMS storage and disk. We show that using MEMS as a disk cache can significantly improve system performance and cost-performance ratio.", "authors": [{"name": "bo hong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81450594686"}, {"name": "feng wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81423595468"}, {"name": "scott a brandt", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100446592"}, {"name": "darrell d e long", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81342502665"}, {"name": "thomas j e schwarz", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350599033"}], "title": "Using MEMS-based storage in computer systems---MEMS storage architectures", "citations": [{"Name": "Hyokyung Bahn ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Soyoon Lee ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sam H.

Modern software systems consist of a collection of layers and information exchange across the layers is performed via well-defined interfaces. Due to the strictness and inflexibility of interface definition, it is not possible to pass the information specific to one layer to other layers. In practice, the exploitation of this information across the layers can greatly enhance the performance, reliability, and manageability of the system. We address the limitation of legacy interface definition via enabling intelligence in the storage system. The objective is to enable the lower-layer entity, for example, a physical or block device, to conjecture the semantic and contextual information of that application behavior which cannot be passed via the legacy interface. Based upon the knowledge obtained by the intelligence module, the system can perform a number of actions to improve the performance, reliability, security, and manageability of the system. Our intelligence storage system focuses on optimizing the I/O subsystem performance for a soft real-time application. Our intelligence framework consists of three components: theworkload monitor,workload analyzer, andsystem optimizer. The workload monitor maintains a window of recent I/O requests and extractsfeature vectorsin regular intervals. The workload analyzer is trained to determine the class of the incoming workload by using the feature vector. The system optimizer performs various actions to tune the storage system for a given workload. We useconfidence rate boostingto train the workload analyzer. This sophisticated learner achieves a higher than 97&percnt; accuracy of workload class prediction. We develop a prototype intelligence storage system on the legacy operating system platform. The system optimizer performs; (1) dynamic adjustment of the file-system-level read-ahead size; (2) dynamic adjustment of I/O request size; and (3) filtering of I/O requests. We examine the effect of this autonomic optimization via experimentation. We find that the storage level pro-active optimization greatly enhances the efficiency of the underlying storage system. The sophisticated intelligence module developed in this work does not restrict its usage for performance optimization. It can be effectively used as classification engine for generic autonomic computing environment, i.e. management, diagnosis, security and etc.", "authors": [{"name": "youjip won", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100455351"}, {"name": "hyungkyu chang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319489588"}, {"name": "jaemin ryu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319500284"}, {"name": "yongdai kim", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81423595642"}, {"name": "junseok shim", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81542530956"}], "title": "Intelligent storage: Cross-layer optimization for soft real-time workload", "citations": [{"Name": "Jongmin Gim ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Youjip Won", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dong In Shin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Young Jin Yu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hyeong S.

Current disk caching and RAM file systems either impose high overhead to access memory content or fail to provide mechanisms to achieve data persistence across reboots.TheConquestfile system is based on the observation that memory is becoming inexpensive, which enables all file system services to be delivered from memory, except for providing large storage capacity. Unlike caching,Conquestuses memory with battery backup as persistent storage, and provides specialized and separate data paths to memory and disk. Therefore, the memory data path contains no disk-related complexity. The disk data path consists of optimizations only for the specialized disk usage pattern.Compared to a memory-based file system,Conquestincurs little performance overhead. Compared to several disk-based file systems,Conquestachieves 1.3x to 19x faster memory performance, and 1.4x to 2.0x faster performance when exercising both memory and disk.Conquestrealizes most of the benefits of persistent RAM at a fraction of the cost of a RAM-only solution. It also demonstrates that disk-related optimizations impose high overheads for accessing memory content in a memory-rich environment.", "authors": [{"name": "an-i andy wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384595010"}, {"name": "geoff kuenning", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100529705"}, {"name": "peter reiher", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100172039"}, {"name": "gerald popek", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81337492702"}], "title": "TheConquestfile system: Better performance through a disk/persistent-RAM hybrid design", "citations": [{"Name": "John D.

A consequence of this trend is the need to serve multiple users and/or workloads simultaneously. It is imperative to ensure that these users are insulated from each other by virtualization in order to meet any service-level objective (SLO). Previous proposals for performance virtualization suffer from one or more of the following drawbacks: (1) They rely on a fairly detailed performance model of the underlying storage system; (2) couple rate and latency allocation in a single scheduler, making them less flexible; or (3) may not always exploit the full bandwidth offered by the storage system.This article presents a two-level scheduling framework that can be built on top of an existing storage utility. This framework uses a low-level feedback-driven request scheduler, called AVATAR, that is intended to meet the latency bounds determined by the SLO. The load imposed on AVATAR is regulated by a high-level rate controller, called SARC, to insulate the users from each other. In addition, SARC is work-conserving and tries to fairly distribute any spare bandwidth in the storage system to the different users. This framework naturally decouples rate and latency allocation. Using extensive I/O traces and a detailed storage simulator, we demonstrate that this two-level framework can simultaneously meet the latency and throughput requirements imposed by an SLO, without requiring extensive knowledge of the underlying storage system.", "authors": [{"name": "jianyong zhang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81408598348"}, {"name": "anand sivasubramaniam", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100205544"}, {"name": "qian wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81408592631"}, {"name": "alma riska", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100466124"}, {"name": "erik riedel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100553023"}], "title": "Storage performance virtualization via throughput and latency control", "citations": [{"Name": "S.

This is especially true for applications in the parallel computing domain that frequently perform large amounts of file I/O. Collective I/O strategy that coordinates the processes to perform I/O on each other's behalf has demonstrated a significant performance improvement. This article proposes a new concept called Multicollective I/O (MCIO) that expands the collective I/O to allow data from multiple files to be requested in a single I/O request, in contrast to allowing only multiple segments for a single file to be specified together. MCIO considers multiple arrays simultaneously by having a more global view of the overall I/O behavior exhibited by parallel applications. This article shows that determining the optimal MCIO access pattern is an NP-complete problem, and proposes two different heuristics for the access pattern detection problem, also called the assignment problem. Both heuristics have been implemented within a runtime library, and tested using a large-scale scientific application. Our results show that MCIO outperforms collective I/O by as much as 87&percnt;. Our runtime library-based implementation can be used by application users as well as by optimizing compilers. Based on our results, we recommend that future library designers for I/O-intensive applications include MCIO in their suite of optimizations.", "authors": [{"name": "gokhan memik", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100387405"}, {"name": "mahmut t kandemir", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100186744"}, {"name": "wei-keng liao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100507702"}, {"name": "alok choudhary", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100655296"}], "title": "Multicollective I/O: A technique for exploiting inter-file access patterns", "citations": [{"Name": "Vijay Vasudevan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michael Kaminsky ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "David G.

This has led to the proliferation of high-end mass storage systems, storage area clusters, and data centers. These storage facilities offer a large range of choices in terms of capacity and access rate, as well as strong data availability and consistency support. However, for most end-users, the \u201clast mile\u201d in their analysis pipeline often requires data processing and visualization at local computers, typically local desktop workstations. End-user workstations---despite having more processing power than ever before---are ill-equipped to cope with such data demands due to insufficient secondary storage space and I/O rates. Meanwhile, a large portion of desktop storage is unused.We propose the FreeLoader framework, which aggregates unused desktop storage space and I/O bandwidth into a shared cache/scratch space, for hosting large, immutable datasets and exploiting data access locality. This article presents the FreeLoader architecture, component design, and performance results based on our proof-of-concept prototype. Its architecture comprises contributing benefactor nodes, steered by a management layer, providing services such as data integrity, high performance, load balancing, and impact control. Our experiments show that FreeLoader is an appealing low-cost solution to storing massive datasets by delivering higher data access rates than traditional storage facilities, namely, local or remote shared file systems, storage systems, and Internet data repositories. In particular, we present novel data striping techniques that allow FreeLoader to efficiently aggregate a workstation's network communication bandwidth and local I/O bandwidth. In addition, the performance impact on the native workload of donor machines is small and can be effectively controlled. Further, we show that security features such as data encryptions and integrity checks can be easily added as filters for interested clients. Finally, we demonstrate how legacy applications can use the FreeLoader API to store and retrieve datasets.", "authors": [{"name": "sudharshan s vazhkudai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100265876"}, {"name": "xiaosong ma", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452597715"}, {"name": "vincent w freeh", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100509276"}, {"name": "jonathan w strickland", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81319501759"}, {"name": "nandan tammineedi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81430647024"}, {"name": "tyler simon", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332527935"}, {"name": "stephen l scott", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452610405"}], "title": "Constructing collaborative desktop storage caches for large scientific datasets", "citations": [{"Name": "Justin M.

Using layered, or stackable, file systems is a powerful technique to incrementally extend the functionality of existing file systems on commodity OSes at runtime. In this article, we analyze the evolution of layering from historical models to what is found in four different present day commodity OSes: Solaris, FreeBSD, Linux, and Microsoft Windows. We classify layered file systems into five types based on their functionality and identify the requirements that each class imposes on the OS. We then present five major design issues that we encountered during our experience of developing over twenty layered file systems on four OSes. We discuss how we have addressed each of these issues on current OSes, and present insights into useful OS and VFS features that would provide future developers more versatile solutions for incremental file system development.", "authors": [{"name": "erez zadok", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100256303"}, {"name": "rakesh iyer", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332506149"}, {"name": "nikolai joukov", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309494307"}, {"name": "gopalan sivathanu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100040525"}, {"name": "charles p wright", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330500224"}], "title": "On incremental file system development", "citations": [{"Name": "Wasim Ahmad Bhat ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "S.M.K.

The fundamental device structures, operating principle, and theoretically predicted device performance are presented. Spin MOSFETs potentially exhibit significant magnetotransport effects, such as large magneto-current, and also satisfy important requirements for integrated circuit applications such as high transconductance, low power-delay product, and low off-current. Since spin MOSFETs can perform signal processing and logic operations and can store digital data using both charge transport and spin degrees of freedom, they are expected to be building blocks for memory cells and logic gates in spin-electronic integrated circuits. Novel spin-electronic integrated circuit architectures for nonvolatile memory and reconfigurable logic employing spin MOSFETs are also presented.", "authors": [{"name": "satoshi sugahara", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81316490768"}, {"name": "masaaki tanaka", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81316491093"}], "title": "Spin MOSFETs as a basis for spintronics", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "64\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "1669\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of tokyo tokyo japan", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "satoshi sugahara"}, {"country": "Japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of tokyo tokyo japan", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "masaaki tanaka"}]}}, "date": {"month": "May", "year": "2006"}}}, "Volume1": {"Issue4": {"articles": {"Pages: 419-456": {"references": ["Jussara M.

Exedra has been designed to provide scalable and efficient support for variable bit-rate media streams whose compression efficiency leads to reduced storage space and bandwidth requirements in comparison to constant bit-rate streams of equivalent quality. We examine alternative disk striping policies, and quantify the benefits of innovative techniques for storage space allocation, buffer management, and resource reservation, which we developed to achieve both predictability and high-performance in handling disk and network data transfers of variable size. Additionally, we investigate the differences between diverse data replication schemes over disk arrays, and compare methods for disk access time reservation that enable tolerance of disk failures at minimal cost. Overall, we demonstrate the feasibility of building network media servers that exploit the latest advances in media compression technology towards reducing the cost of wide-scale streaming services for stored data.", "authors": [{"name": "stergios v anastasiadis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100555639"}, {"name": "kenneth c sevcik", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100228549"}, {"name": "michael stumm", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81328490741"}], "title": "Scalable and fault-tolerant support for variable bit-rate data in the exedra streaming server", "citations": [{"Name": "Hyunjoo Kim ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Heon Y.

Existing management tools rely on resource provisioning to meet performance goals; they require detailed knowledge of the system characteristics and the workloads. Provisioning is inherently slow to react to system and workload dynamics and, in the general case, it is not practical to provision for the worst case.We propose a software-only solution that ensures predictable performance for storage access. It is applicable to a wide range of storage systems and makes no assumptions about workload characteristics. We use an online feedback loop with an adaptive controller that throttles storage access requests to ensure that the available system throughput is shared among workloads according to their performance goals and their relative importance. The controller considers the system as a \u201cblack box\u201d and adapts automatically to system and workload changes. The controller is distributed to ensure high availability under overload conditions, and it can be used for both block and file access protocols. The evaluation ofTriage, our experimental prototype, demonstrates workload isolation and differentiation in an overloaded cluster file-system where workloads and system components are changing.", "authors": [{"name": "magnus karlsson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100618348"}, {"name": "christos karamanolis", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100420106"}, {"name": "xiaoyun zhu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100414248"}], "title": "Triage: Performance differentiation for storage systems using adaptive control", "citations": [{"Name": "Michael P.

As high-capacity flash memory is becoming more affordable than ever, the dilemma of how to manage the RAM space or how to improve the access performance is emerging for many vendors. In this article, we propose a tree-based management scheme which adopts multiple granularities in flash-memory management. Our objective is to not only reduce the run-time RAM footprint but also manage the write workload, due to housekeeping. The proposed method was evaluated under realistic workloads, where significant advantages over existing approaches were observed, in terms of the RAM space, access performance, and flash-memory lifetime.", "authors": [{"name": "li-pin chang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350599676"}, {"name": "tei-wei kuo", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452594769"}], "title": "Efficient management for large-scale flash-memory storage systems with resource conservation", "citations": [{"Name": "Peiquan Jin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yi Ou ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Theo H\u00e4rder ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Zhi Li", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yuhui Deng ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Frank Wang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Na Helian", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "EED: Energy Efficient Disk drive architecture", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hyunchul Park ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dongkun Shin", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Buffer flush and address mapping scheme for flash memory solid-state disk", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Duck-Ho Bae ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ji-Woong Chang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sang-Wook Kim", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "An efficient method for record management in flash memory environment", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jen-Wei Hsieh ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chung-Hsien Wu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ge-Ming Chiu", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Tao Xie ", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Deepthi Madathil", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yong-Goo Lee ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dawoon Jung ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dongwon Kang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jin-Soo Kim", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yi-Reun Kim ", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kyu-Young Whang ", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Il-Yeol Song", "Country": "india", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Peiquan Jin ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xike Xie ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Na Wang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Lihua Yue", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Optimizing R-tree for flash memory", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dawoon Jung ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jeong-UK Kang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Heeseung Jo ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jin-Soo Kim ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Joonwon Lee", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dongchul Park ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Biplob Debnath ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Youngjin Nam ", "Country": "italy", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "David H.

It balances workload by moving file sets among cluster server nodes. It responds to changing server resources that arise from failure and recovery, and dynamically adding or removing servers. It also realizes performance consistency---nearly uniform performance across all servers. The system is adaptive and self-tuning. It operates without anya prioriknowledge of workload properties, or the capabilities of the servers. Rather, it continuously tunes load placement using a technique called adaptive, nonuniform (ANU) randomization. ANU randomization realizes the scalability and metadata reduction benefits of hash-based, randomized placement techniques, while avoiding hashing's drawbacks: load skew, inability to cope with heterogeneity, and lack of tunability. ANU randomization outperforms virtual-processor approaches to load balancing, while reducing the amount of shared state among servers and the amount of load movement.", "authors": [{"name": "changxun wu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100663168"}, {"name": "randal burns", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100421114"}], "title": "Tunable randomization for load management in shared-disk clusters", "citations": [{"Name": "Juan Wang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Dan Feng ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fang Wang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chengtao Lu", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "12\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "0\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "842\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Belize", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "johns hopkins university baltimore md", "city": "hopkins", "Name": "changxun wu"}, {"country": "Belize", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "johns hopkins university baltimore md", "city": "hopkins", "Name": "randal burns"}]}, "Pages: 1-2": {"references": [], "doi": "doi>10.1145/1044956.1044957", "ref_links": {}, "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"name": "sreeranga p rajan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100661201"}], "title": "Editorial", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "11\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "648\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "fujitsu laboratories of america sunnyvale ca", "city": null, "Name": "sreeranga p rajan"}]}, "Pages: 38-70": {"references": ["Remzi H.

Another advantage of CHTs is that they can be designed to be as self-managing as a cluster of stateless servers. One key to achieving this extreme manageability is reboot-based recovery that is predictably fast and has modest impact on system performance and availability. This \"cheap\" recovery mechanism simplifies management in two ways. First, it simplifies failure detection by lowering the cost of acting on false positives. This enables one to use statistical techniques to turn hard-to-catch failures, such as node degradation, into failure, followed by recovery. Second, cheap recovery simplifies capacity planning by recasting repartitioning as failure plus recovery to achieve zero-downtime incremental scaling. These low-cost recovery and scaling mechanisms make it possible for the system to be continuously self-adjusting, a key property of self-managing systems.", "authors": [{"name": "andrew c huang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81407592081"}, {"name": "armando fox", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100498790"}], "title": "Cheap recovery: a key to self-managing state", "citations": [{"Name": "Zhilim Zhang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Junying Zhang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Qiuyan Huo ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jingyu Chen ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xuezhou Xu", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Fu Duan ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiaoli Li ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yi Liu ", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Yun Fang", "Country": "china", "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "11\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "1048\n", "Citation Count": "2\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "stanford university stanford ca", "city": null, "Name": "andrew c huang"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "stanford university stanford ca", "city": null, "Name": "armando fox"}]}, "Pages: 95-107": {"references": ["Dave Anderson , Jim Dykes , Erik Riedel, More Than an Interface---SCSI vs. ATA, Proceedings of the 2nd USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies, March 31-31, 2003, San Francisco, CA\n", "Daniel, E., Mee, C.

The low cost of these serial ATA (SATA) PC drives is a tradeoff against drive reliability design and demonstration test levels, which are higher in the more expensive SCSI and Fibre Channel drives. This article discusses the tradeoff between SATA which has the advantage that fewer higher capacity drives are needed for a given system storage capacity, which further reduces cost and allows higher drive failure rates, and the use of additional storage system redundancy and drive failure prediction to maintain system data integrity using less reliable drives. RAID stripe failure probability is calculated using typical ATA and SCSI drive failure rates, for single and double parity data reconstruction failure, and failure due to drive unrecoverable block errors. Reliability improvement from drive failure prediction is also calculated, and can be significant. Today's SATA drive specifications for unrecoverable block errors appear to allow stripe reconstruction failure, and additional in-drive parity blocks are suggested as a solution. The possibility of using low cost disks data for backup and archiving is discussed, replacing higher cost magnetic tape. This requires significantly better RAID stripe failure probability, and suitable drive technology alternatives are discussed. The failure rate of nonoperating drives is estimated using failure analysis results from &ap;4000 drives. Nonoperating RAID stripe failure rates are thereby estimated. User data security needs to be assured in addition to reliability, and to extend past the point where physical control of drives is lost, such as when drives are removed from systems for data vaulting, repair, sale, or discard. Today, over a third of resold drives contain unerased user data. Security is proposed via the existing SATA drive secure-erase command, or via the existing SATA drive password commands, or by data encryption. Finally, backup and archival disc storage is compared to magnetic tape, a technology with a proven reliability record over the full half-century of digital data storage. In contrast, tape archives are not vulnerable to tape transport failure modes. Only failure modes in the archived tapes and reels will make data unrecoverable.", "authors": [{"name": "gordon f hughes", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81538924356"}, {"name": "joseph f murray", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100181248"}], "title": "Reliability and security of RAID storage systems and D2D archives using SATA disk drives", "citations": [{"Name": "Swetha Krishnan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Giridhar Ravipati ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andrea C.

Unlike most other contemporary protocols, DISP permits applications to make explicit tradeoffs between total storage space, computational overhead, and guarantees of availability, integrity, and privacy on a per-object basis. Applications specify the degree of redundancy with which each item is encoded, what level of integrity checks are computed and stored with each item, and whether items are stored in an encrypted format. At one extreme, clients willing to pay the overhead are guaranteed privacy, integrity, and availability of data stored in the system as long as fewer than half the servers are Byzantine. At the other extreme, objects that do not require privacy or integrity in the face of Byzantine servers can be stored with very low computational and storage overhead.DISP is efficient in terms of message count, message size, and storage requirements: even in the worst case, the read and write protocols require a number of messages that are linear with respect to the number of servers. In terms of message size, DISP requires transferring only marginally more thanLbytes to correctly read an object of sizeL, even in the face of Byzantine server failures. In this article we provide a description of DISP and an analysis of its fault-tolerant properties. We also analyze the complexity of the protocol and discuss several potential applications.

A major challenge to regeneration is maintaining consistency when the replica group changes. Doing so is particularly difficult across the wide area where failure detection is complicated by network congestion and node overload.In this context, this article presents Om, the first read/write peer-to-peer, wide-area storage system that achieves high availability and manageability through online automatic regeneration while still preserving consistency guarantees. We achieve these properties through the following techniques. First, by utilizing thelimited view divergenceproperty in today's Internet and by adopting thewitness model, Om is able to regenerate from any single replica, rather than requiring a majority quorum, at the cost of a small (10\u22126in our experiments) probability of violating consistency during each regeneration. As a result, Om can deliver high availability with a small number of replicas, while traditional designs would significantly increase the number of replicas. Next, we distinguishfailure-freereconfigurations fromfailure-inducedones, enabling common reconfigurations to proceed with a single round of communication. Finally, we use alease graphamong the replicas and a two-phase write protocol to optimize for reads, so that reads in Om can be processed by any single replica. Experiments on PlanetLab show that consistent regeneration in Om completes in approximately 20 seconds.", "authors": [{"name": "haifeng yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452596145"}, {"name": "amin vahdat", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100104394"}], "title": "Consistent and automatic replica regeneration", "citations": [{"Name": "Predrag Kne\u017eevi\u0107 ", "Country": "netherlands", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Andreas Wombacher ", "Country": "netherlands", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Thomas Risse", "Country": "netherlands", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mate J.

This article addresses two key challenges in wireless sensor networks: in-network storage and distributed search. The need for these techniques arises from the inability to provide persistent, centralized storage and querying in many sensor networks. Centralized storage requires multihop transmission of sensor data to Internet gateways which can quickly drain battery-operated nodes.Constructing a storage and search system that satisfies the requirements of data-rich scientific applications is a daunting task for many reasons: (a) the data requirements may be large compared to available storage and communication capacity of resource-constrained nodes, (b) user requirements are diverse and range from identification and collection of interesting event signatures to obtaining a deeper understanding of long-term trends and anomalies in the sensor events, and (c) many applications are in new domains where a priori information may not be available to reduce these requirements.This article describes alossy, gracefully degrading storage model. We believe that such a model is necessary and sufficient for many scientific applications since it supports both progressive data collection for interesting events as well as long-term in-network storage for in-network querying and processing. Our system demonstrates the use of in-network wavelet-based summarization and progressive aging of summaries in support of long-term querying in storage and communication-constrained networks. We evaluate the performance of our linux implementation and show that it achieves: (a) low communication overhead for multiresolution summarization, (b) highly efficient drill-down search over such summaries, and (c) efficient use of network storage capacity through load-balancing and progressive aging of summaries.", "authors": [{"name": "deepak ganesan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100584030"}, {"name": "ben greenstein", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100210712"}, {"name": "deborah estrin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100020429"}, {"name": "john heidemann", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100132058"}, {"name": "ramesh govindan", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81327488641"}], "title": "Multiresolution storage and search in sensor networks", "citations": [{"Name": "Ying Li ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "M.

Most studies use control algorithms that dynamically transition devices to low power modes after they are idle for a certain threshold period of time. The control algorithms used in the past have two major limitations. First, they require painstaking, application-dependent manual tuning of their thresholds to achieve energy savings without significantly degrading performance. Second, they do not provide performance guarantees.This article addresses these two limitations for both memory and disks, making memory/disk energy-saving schemes practical enough to use in real systems. Specifically, we make four main contributions. (1) We propose a technique that provides a performance guarantee for control algorithms. We show that our method works well for all tested cases, even with previously proposed algorithms that are not performance-aware. (2) We propose a new control algorithm,Performance-Directed Dynamic(PD), that dynamically adjusts its thresholds periodically, based on available slack and recent workload characteristics. For memory, PD consumes the least energy when compared to previous hand-tuned algorithms combined with a performance guarantee. However, for disks, PD is too complex and its self-tuning is unable to beat previous hand-tuned algorithms. (3) To improve on PD, we propose a simpler, optimization-based, threshold-free control algorithm,Performance-Directed Static(PS). PS periodically assigns a static configuration by solving an optimization problem that incorporates information about the available slack and recent traffic variability to different chips/disks. We find that PS is the best or close to the best across all performance-guaranteed disk algorithms, including hand-tuned versions. (4) We also explore a hybrid scheme that combines PS and PD algorithms to further improve energy savings.", "authors": [{"name": "xiaodong li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81542068656"}, {"name": "zhenmin li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452596703"}, {"name": "yuanyuan zhou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451594551"}, {"name": "sarita adve", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100524186"}], "title": "Performance directed energy management for main memory and disks", "citations": [{"Name": "Hui Zhang ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Kenji Yoshihira ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ya-Yunn Su ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Guofei Jiang ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ming Chen ", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiaorui Wang", "Country": "germany", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Henry Hoffmann", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Mingsong Bi ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Srinivasan Chandrasekharan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Chris Gniady", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Gangyong Jia ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Guangjie Han ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jinfang Jiang ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Joel J.P.C.

Ext3cow provides atime-shiftinginterface that permits a real-time and continuous view of data in the past. Time-shifting does not pollute the file system namespace nor require snapshots to be mounted as a separate file system. Further, ext3cow is implemented entirely in the file system space and, therefore, does not modify kernel interfaces or change the operation of other file systems. Ext3cow takes advantage of the fine-grained control of on-disk and in-memory data available only to a file system, resulting in minimal degradation of performance and functionality. Experimental results confirm this hypothesis; ext3cow performs comparably to ext3 on many benchmarks and on trace-driven experiments.", "authors": [{"name": "zachary peterson", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100505185"}, {"name": "randal burns", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100421114"}], "title": "Ext3cow: a time-shifting file system for regulatory compliance", "citations": [{"Name": "Jinsun Suk ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Moonkyung Kim ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Hyun Chul Eom ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Jaechun No", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Arthur M\u00fcller ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Sebastian R\u00f6nnau ", "Country": "united kingdom", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Uwe M.

They can be exploited for improving the effectiveness of storage caching, prefetching, data layout, and disk scheduling. Unfortunately, information about block correlations is unavailable at the storage system level. Previous approaches for discovering file correlations in file systems do not scale well enough for discovering block correlations in storage systems.In this article, we propose two algorithms,C-MinerandC-Miner&ast;, that use a data mining technique calledfrequent sequence miningto discover block correlations in storage systems. Both algorithms run reasonably fast with feasible space requirement, indicating that they are practical for dynamically inferring correlations in a storage system.C-Mineris a direct application of a frequent-sequence mining algorithm with a few modifications; compared withC-Miner,C-Miner&ast; is redesigned for mining block correlations by making concessions for the specific problem of long sequences in storage system traces. Therefore,C-Miner&ast; can discover 7--109&percnt; more correlation rules within 2--15 times shorter time thanC-Miner. Moreover, we have also evaluated the benefits of block correlation-directed prefetching and data layout through experiments. Our results using real system workloads show that correlation-directed prefetching and data layout can reduce average I/O response time by 12--30&percnt; compared to the base case, and 7--25&percnt; compared to the commonly used sequential prefetching scheme for most workloads.", "authors": [{"name": "zhenmin li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452596703"}, {"name": "zhifeng chen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100107912"}, {"name": "yuanyuan zhou", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451594551"}], "title": "Mining block correlations to improve storage performance", "citations": [{"Name": "Zhu Xudong ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Meng Xiaoxuan ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xiao Wenshu ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Ke Jian ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Xu Lu", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Orko Momin ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Cengiz Karakoyunlu ", "Country": "canada", "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Michael T.

D-GRAID ensures that most files within the file system remain available even when an unexpectedly high number of faults occur. D-GRAID achieves high availability through aggressive replication of semantically critical data, and fault-isolated placement of logically related data. D-GRAID also recovers from failures quickly, restoring only live file system data to a hot spare. Both graceful degradation and live-block recovery are implemented in a prototype SCSI-based storage system underneath unmodified file systems, demonstrating that powerful \u201cfile-system like\u201d functionality can be implemented within a \u201csemantically smart\u201d disk system behind a narrow block-based interface.", "authors": [{"name": "muthian sivathanu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100040527"}, {"name": "vijayan prabhakaran", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100181112"}, {"name": "andrea c arpaci-dusseau", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100272384"}, {"name": "remzi h arpaci-dusseau", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100272389"}], "title": "Improving storage system availability with D-GRAID", "citations": [{"Name": "S.

As we wait for the uncertain takeoff of technologies that promise to improve the situation, we propose to explore an approach that is potentially more easily realizable: the use of digital storage media transported by the postal system as a general digital communication mechanism. We shall call such a system aPostmanet. Compared to more conventional wide-area connectivity options, the Postmanet has several important advantages, including wide global reach, great bandwidth potential, low cost, and ease of incremental adoption. While the idea of sending digital content via the postal system is not a new one, none of the existing attempts have turned the postal system into agenericandtransparentcommunication channel that not only can cater to a wide array of applications, but also effectively manage the many idiosyncrasies associated with using the postal system. In the proposed Postmanet, we see two recurring themes at many different levels of the system. One is the simultaneous exploitation of the Internet and the postal system so we can combine their latency and bandwidth advantages. The other is the exploitation of the abundant capacity and bandwidth of the Postmanet to improve its latency, cost, and reliability.", "authors": [{"name": "nitin garg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100630011"}, {"name": "sumeet sobti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100511062"}, {"name": "junwen lai", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100543903"}, {"name": "fengzhou zheng", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81344501020"}, {"name": "kai li", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100475927"}, {"name": "randolph y wang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100212421"}, {"name": "arvind krishnamurthy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100373233"}], "title": "Bridging the digital divide: storage media + postal network = generic high-bandwidth communication", "citations": [{"Name": "Aruna Balasubramanian ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Brian Neil Levine ", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}, {"Name": "Arun Venkataramani", "Country": null, "Affiliation": null}], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "24\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "1207\n", "Citation Count": "3\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "princeton university princeton nj", "city": null, "Name": "nitin garg"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "princeton university princeton nj", "city": null, "Name": "sumeet sobti"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "princeton university princeton nj", "city": null, "Name": "junwen lai"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "princeton university princeton nj", "city": null, "Name": "fengzhou zheng"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "princeton university princeton nj", "city": null, "Name": "kai li"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "princeton university princeton nj", "city": null, "Name": "randolph y wang"}, {"country": "United States", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "yale university new haven ct", "city": "new haven", "Name": "arvind krishnamurthy"}]}}, "date": {"month": "May", "year": "2005"}}}}}}
