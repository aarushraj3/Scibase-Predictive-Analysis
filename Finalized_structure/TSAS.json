Consider a scenario in which a group of users is trying to find a common meeting location, yet attempting to include all group members is introducing a significant traveling cost to most of them. In this article, we formulate a new query type called theconsensus query, which can be used to help users explore these trade-off options to find a solution upon which everyone can agree. Specifically, we study the problem of evaluating consensus queries in the context of nearest neighbor queries, where the group is interested in finding a meeting place that minimizes the travel distance for at least a specified number of group members. To help the group in selecting a suitable solution, the major challenge is to find optimal subgroups of all allowable subgroup sizes, i.e., greater or equal to the minimum specified subgroup size, that minimize the travel distances. We develop incremental algorithms to evaluate in one pass the optimal query subgroups of different sizes along with their corresponding nearest data points. These subsets, which are evaluated by the location-based service provider, constitute the answer set that is returned to the group. The group then collaboratively selects the final answer from the candidate answer set. An extensive experimental study shows the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed techniques.", "authors": [{"name": "mohammed eunus ali", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435597825"}, {"name": "egemen tanin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100316892"}, {"name": "peter scheuermann", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100099073"}, {"name": "sarana nutanong", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100508207"}, {"name": "lars kulik", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100419795"}], "title": "Spatial Consensus Queries in a Collaborative Environment", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "34\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "34\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "34\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "bangladesh", "university": "bangladesh university of engineering and technology", "affiliation_string": "bangladesh university of engineering and technology bangladesh dhaka bangladesh", "city": "dhaka", "Name": "mohammed eunus ali"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "university of melbourne", "affiliation_string": "university of melbourne australia victoria australia", "city": "melbourne", "Name": "egemen tanin"}, {"country": "cambodia", "university": "western university", "affiliation_string": "northwestern university usa evanston il", "city": "phnum penh", "Name": "peter scheuermann"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "city university", "affiliation_string": "city university of hong kong hong kong kowloon", "city": "london", "Name": "sarana nutanong"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "university of melbourne", "affiliation_string": "university of melbourne australia victoria australia", "city": "melbourne", "Name": "lars kulik"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["Alberto Belussi , Sara Migliorini , Mauro Negri , Giuseppe Pelagatti, Robustness of spatial relation evaluation in data exchange, Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems, November 06-09, 2012, Redondo Beach, California[doi>10.1145/2424321.2424386]\n", "Jean-Daniel Boissonnat , Franco P.

It is based on the well-known Snap Rounding algorithm but improves it by eliminating from the snap rounded arrangement the configurations in which the distance between a vertex and a nonincident edge is smaller than half the width of a pixel of the rounding grid. Therefore, the goal of SRR is exactly the same as the goal of another algorithm, Iterated Snap Rounding (ISR), and of its evolution, Iterated Snap Rounding with Bounded Drift (ISRBD). However, SRR produces an output with a quality of approximation that is on average better than ISRBD, under the viewpoint both of the distance from the original segments and of the conservation of their topological structure. The article also reports some cases where ISRBD, notwithstanding the bounded drift, produces strong topological modifications while SRR does not. A statistical analysis on a large collection of input datasets confirms these differences. It follows that the proposed Snap Rounding with Restore algorithm is suitable for applications that require robustness, a guaranteed geometric approximation, and a good topological approximation.", "authors": [{"name": "alberto belussi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100338358"}, {"name": "sara migliorini", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81447603632"}, {"name": "mauro negri", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100191326"}, {"name": "giuseppe pelagatti", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81387595743"}], "title": "Snap Rounding with Restore: An Algorithm for Producing Robust Geometric Datasets", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "36\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "36\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "36\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "italy", "university": "university of verona", "affiliation_string": "university of verona italy", "city": "verona", "Name": "alberto belussi"}, {"country": "italy", "university": "university of verona", "affiliation_string": "university of verona italy", "city": "verona", "Name": "sara migliorini"}, {"country": "italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "politecnico of milano italy", "city": null, "Name": "mauro negri"}, {"country": "italy", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "politecnico of milano italy", "city": null, "Name": "giuseppe pelagatti"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["Niels Agatz, Alan Erera, Martin Savelsbergh, and Xing Wang. 2012.

It can be an effective solution to counter the problem of increasing traffic jams at peak hours in cities. The growing use and popularity of smart phones and GPS-enabled devices provides us with tools required to efficiently implement ride sharing and significantly enhance carpooling. However, privacy and safety concerns are the main obstacles faced when encouraging people to use such a service. In this work, we present \u201cMatch Maker,\u201d a negotiation-based model that hides exact location information data for system participants while implementing privacy preserving ride sharing. We use the concept of imprecision (not being precise about location of the user out of set ofnlocations) and follow the idea of obfuscation, which equates a higher degree of imprecision with a higher degree of privacy. We identify two attack types that could circumvent privacy preserving ride sharing. We compare the Match Maker model with the standard central trusted server model collecting precise location data, which we term eBay model. We provide the first comprehensive approach that integrates privacy, safety and trust in a single model. We present a recursive ellipse-based algorithm to compute an optimal driver path as well as three negotiation strategies for drivers and passengers. We conduct extensive experiments on real road networks and compare the strategies for privacy and effectiveness of ride sharing in terms of traffic load and vehicle km reduction. We show that ride sharing saves between 9&percnt; and 21&percnt; (on average 12&percnt;) of vehicle km if drivers are only prepared to accept slight detours of their usual trips. In the city of Melbourne, with 11.6 million trips a weekday and an average trip length of 10.2 km, this would save 14.2 million km per weekday.", "authors": [{"name": "preeti goel", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81551950256"}, {"name": "lars kulik", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100419795"}, {"name": "kotagiri ramamohanarao", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100532239"}], "title": "Privacy-Aware Dynamic Ride Sharing", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "41\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "41\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "41\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "australia", "university": "university of melbourne", "affiliation_string": "the university of melbourne victoria australia", "city": "melbourne", "Name": "preeti goel"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "university of melbourne", "affiliation_string": "the university of melbourne victoria australia", "city": "melbourne", "Name": "lars kulik"}, {"country": "australia", "university": "university of melbourne", "affiliation_string": "the university of melbourne victoria australia", "city": "melbourne", "Name": "kotagiri ramamohanarao"}]}, "Article No.: 2": {"references": ["M.

We present a quadratic-time simplification algorithm based on an operation callededge-move. We prove that the number of edges of any nonconvex simple polygon can be reduced with this operation. Moreover, edge-moves preserve area and topology and do not introduce new orientations. The latter property in particular makes the algorithm highly suitable for schematization in which all resulting lines are required to be parallel to one of a given set of lines (orientations). To obtain such a result, we need only to preprocess the input to use only lines that are parallel to one of the given set. We present an algorithm to enforce such orientation restrictions, again without changing area or topology. Experiments show that our algorithms obtain results of high visual quality.", "authors": [{"name": "kevin buchin", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100464231"}, {"name": "wouter meulemans", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474698460"}, {"name": "andre van renssen", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474704874"}, {"name": "bettina speckmann", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100422936"}], "title": "Area-Preserving Simplification and Schematization of Polygonal Subdivisions", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "18\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "18\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "18\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Netherlands", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "tu eindhoven mb eindhoven the netherlands", "city": "eindhoven", "Name": "kevin buchin"}, {"country": "united kingdom", "university": "city university", "affiliation_string": "city university london london united kingdom", "city": "london", "Name": "wouter meulemans"}, {"country": "Japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of informatics tokyo japan", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "andre van renssen"}, {"country": "Netherlands", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "tu eindhoven mb eindhoven the netherlands", "city": "eindhoven", "Name": "bettina speckmann"}]}}, "date": {"month": "April", "year": "2016"}}}, "Volume1": {"Issue2": {"articles": {"Article No.: 8": {"references": ["Peter Adamson and Evan Tick. 1991.

However, the peculiar characteristics of flash memory require redesigning the existing data storage and indexing techniques that were devised for magnetic hard disks.In this article, we propose TRIFL, an efficient and generic TRajectory Index for FLash. TRIFL is designed around the key requirements of trajectory indexing and flash storage. TRIFL is generic in the sense that it is efficient for both simple flash storage devices such as SD cards and more powerful devices such as solid state drives. In addition, TRIFL is supplied with an online self-tuning algorithm that allows adapting the index structure to the workload and the technical specifications of the flash storage device to maximize the index performance. Moreover, TRIFL achieves good performance with relatively low memory requirements, which makes the index appropriate for many application scenarios. The experimental evaluation shows that TRIFL outperforms the representative indexing methods on magnetic disks and flash disks.", "authors": [{"name": "dai hai ton that", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658738302"}, {"name": "iulian sandu popa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81458655353"}, {"name": "karine zeitouni", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100002211"}], "title": "TRIFL: A Generic Trajectory Index for Flash Storage", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "109\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "14\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "109\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "France", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of versailles saint-quentin versailles france", "city": "versailles", "Name": "dai hai ton that"}, {"country": "France", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of versailles saint-quentin and inria paris-rocquencourt versailles france", "city": "versailles", "Name": "iulian sandu popa"}, {"country": "France", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of versailles saint-quentin versailles france", "city": "versailles", "Name": "karine zeitouni"}]}, "Article No.: 7": {"references": ["Jagrati Agrawal , Yanlei Diao , Daniel Gyllstrom , Neil Immerman, Efficient pattern matching over event streams, Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data, June 09-12, 2008, Vancouver, Canada[doi>10.1145/1376616.1376634]\n", "R.

It faces the challenge of real-time processing a large number of time-variant complex polygons, when points are constantly moving. Following the filter-and-refine policy, in our previous work, we proposed to organize edges per polygon in hash tables to improve the performance of the refining stage. The number of edges, however, is uneven among buckets. As a result, some points that happen to match big buckets with many edges will have much longer responses than usual. In this article, we solve this problem from two aspects: (i) Constructing multiple parallel hash tables and dynamically selecting the bucket with fewest edges and (ii) sorting edges in a bucket so as to realize the crossing number algorithm by binary search. We further combine the two to suggest a hybrid hashing scheme that takes a better tradeoff between real-time pairing points with polygons and system overhead of building hash tables. Extensive analyses and evaluations on two real-world datasets confirm that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the pairing time in terms of both the average and distribution.", "authors": [{"name": "suhua tang", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658650061"}, {"name": "yi yu", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81549088956"}, {"name": "roger zimmermann", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100591582"}, {"name": "sadao obana", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658734366"}], "title": "Efficient Geo-Fencing via Hybrid Hashing: A Combination of Bucket Selection and In-Bucket Binary Search", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "124\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "23\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "124\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of electro-communications chofu tokyo japan", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "suhua tang"}, {"country": "Japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "national institute of informatics tokyo japan", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "yi yu"}, {"country": "singapore", "university": "national university of singapore", "affiliation_string": "national university of singapore singapore", "city": "singapore", "Name": "roger zimmermann"}, {"country": "Japan", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "the university of electro-communications chofu tokyo japan", "city": "tokyo", "Name": "sadao obana"}]}}, "date": {"month": "November", "year": "2015"}}, "Issue1": {"articles": {"Article No.: 3": {"references": ["Mridul Aanjaneya , Frederic Chazal , Daniel Chen , Marc Glisse , Leonidas J.

Given street maps of the same city collected from different sources, researchers often need to know how and where they differ. However, the majority of current graph comparison algorithms are based on structural properties of graphs, such as their degree distribution or their local connectivity properties, and do not consider their spatial embedding. This ignores a key property of road networks since the similarity of travel over two road networks is intimately tied to the specific spatial embedding. Likewise, many current algorithms specific to street map comparison either do not provide quality guarantees or focus on spatial embeddings only.Motivated by road network comparison, we propose a new path-based distance measure between two planar geometric graphs that is based on comparing sets of travel paths generated over the graphs. Surprisingly, we are able to show that using paths of bounded link-length, we can capture global structural and spatial differences between the graphs.We show how to utilize our distance measure as a local signature in order to identify and visualize portions of high similarity in the maps. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation of our distance measure and its local signature on street map data from Berlin, Germany and Athens, Greece.", "authors": [{"name": "mahmuda ahmed", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81550295356"}, {"name": "brittany terese fasy", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436593562"}, {"name": "kyle s hickmann", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658653787"}, {"name": "carola wenk", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81408601058"}], "title": "A Path-Based Distance for Street Map Comparison", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "102\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "19\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "102\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Mali", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of texas at san antonio tx", "city": "san", "Name": "mahmuda ahmed"}, {"country": "France", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "tulane university new orleans la", "city": "orleans", "Name": "brittany terese fasy"}, {"country": "France", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "tulane university new orleans la", "city": "orleans", "Name": "kyle s hickmann"}, {"country": "France", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "tulane university new orleans la", "city": "orleans", "Name": "carola wenk"}]}, "Article No.: 1": {"references": ["E.

This problem occurs frequently in situations in which placing labels directly in the image is impossible or produces too much visual clutter. Examples are annotating maps, photos, or technical/medical illustrations. Previous algorithmic results for boundary labeling consider a single layer of labels along some or all sides of a rectangular image. If, however, the number of labels is large or the labels are too long, multiple layers of labels are needed.In this article, we study boundary labeling for panorama images, wherenpoints in a rectangleRare to be annotated by disjoint unit-height rectangular labels placed aboveRinKdifferent rows (or layers). Each point is connected to its label by a vertical leader that does not intersect any other label. We present polynomial time algorithms based on dynamic programming that either minimize the number of rows to place allnlabels or maximize the number (or total weight) of labels that can be placed inKrows for a given integerK. For weighted labels, the problem is shown to be (weakly) NP-hard; in this case, we give a pseudo-polynomial algorithm to maximize the weight of the selected labels. We have implemented our algorithms; the experimental results show that solutions for realistically sized instances are computed instantaneously. We have also investigated two-sided panorama labeling, for which the labels may be placed above or below the panorama image. In this model, all of the aforementioned problems are NP-hard. For solving them, we propose mixed-integer linear program formulations.", "authors": [{"name": "andreas gemsa", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81481650021"}, {"name": "jan-henrik haunert", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81320490374"}, {"name": "martin nollenburg", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351607290"}], "title": "Multirow Boundary-Labeling Algorithms for Panorama Images", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "82\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "10\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "82\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "karlsruhe institute of technology karlsruhe germany", "city": "karlsruhe", "Name": "andreas gemsa"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of osnabruck osnabruck germany", "city": "osnabruck", "Name": "jan-henrik haunert"}, {"country": "Germany", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "karlsruhe institute of technology karlsruhe germany", "city": "karlsruhe", "Name": "martin nollenburg"}]}, "Article No.: 4": {"references": ["M.

With spatial crowdsourcing, the goal is to crowdsource a set of spatiotemporal tasks (i.e., tasks related to time and location) to a set of workers, which requires the workers to physically travel to those locations in order to perform the tasks. In this article, we focus on one class of spatial crowdsourcing, in which the workers send their locations to the server and thereafter the server assigns to every worker tasks in proximity to the worker\u2019s location with the aim of maximizing the overall number of assigned tasks. We formally define thismaximum task assignment (MTA)problem in spatial crowdsourcing, and identify its challenges. We propose alternative solutions to address these challenges by exploiting the spatial properties of the problem space, including the spatial distribution and the travel cost of the workers. MTA is based on the assumptions that all tasks are of the same type and all workers are equally qualified in performing the tasks. Meanwhile, different types of tasks may require workers with various skill sets or expertise. Subsequently, we extend MTA by taking the expertise of the workers into consideration. We refer to this problem as themaximum score assignment (MSA)problem and show its practicality and generality. Extensive experiments with various synthetic and two real-world datasets show the applicability of our proposed framework.", "authors": [{"name": "hien to", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84460695857"}, {"name": "cyrus shahabi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100616904"}, {"name": "leyla kazemi", "link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81343496863"}], "title": "A Server-Assigned Spatial Crowdsourcing Framework", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (12 months)": "281\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "49\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "281\n", "Citation Count": "0\n"}, "affiliation_data": [{"country": "Hong Kong", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of southern california", "city": "southern", "Name": "hien to"}, {"country": "Hong Kong", "university": null, "affiliation_string": "university of southern california", "city": "southern", "Name": "cyrus shahabi"}, {"country": null, "university": null, "affiliation_string": "microsoft corporation redmond wa", "city": null, "Name": "leyla kazemi"}]}}, "date": {"month": "August", "year": "2015"}}}}}}
